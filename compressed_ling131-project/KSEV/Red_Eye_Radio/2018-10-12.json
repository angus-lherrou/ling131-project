very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about are the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change the outcome of the election ... with the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a Laufer Perkins Cooley who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got\nOr information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they weren't going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use\nIn order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see huge and GPS was a part of it well\nHe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally now they ridge Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty ninth or after\nThe lawyers said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSymptoms from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nHuge fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the dog she ate largely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what the lawyers say they're trying to find here's are are they are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think I'm right are are they going to ask him about a\nA who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you're listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up or I don't think so what are they going to ask him a lot of money I Would either going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow charge of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife is employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the\nAnd an associate deputy attorney general ah\nThe inspector general would have then access to\nAny communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he ... he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes\nOr does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yet like yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes divides from the department and I and and again\nIf the those are ... that's the number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because if the GPS doesn't wanna cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim the fifth mhm yes I Do ... yes and we understand them what I Would wonder is a lens Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right that I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concern what is the same thing\nA Mahler investigation the Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is is going is that the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf a fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know um when I don't know whether it's any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from Perkins going through an opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you do opposite while the what they do opposition research itself in spite of tore so what is he worried about\nWhat would they do what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell at heightening the time on this interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I'll testify I'll go under oath out that there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does she think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr it's there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating his firm\nYeah\nThose are the questions that went to

the polls and seeing how they're all going to react\nAnd yeah and it is and and it is also the wagging of the finger toward people simply for believing in the process\nThere they're being a indirectly condemned for doing so yes saying that you're essentially on a person's side and that you support what we alleged she did write\nYour it which goes against and and think about it\nI I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is he a show you what they used to be used as to what they had become today yes but the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore\nIt shows used as something accord with Americans understand and the ACLU probably did decades of of of damage\nOr to themselves by saying that doesn't matter that the allegation matters by taking a side instead of defending the constitution\nAnd that's when it gets down to and so like I said it's going to be really interesting\nTo see what happens but it's amazing what the Democrats have tried to sell this week instability and due process means nothing right wow mhm eight six six Ninety red eye the\nLatest consumer price index shows no change for what we pay

Senate race there and and writers on well some of the cold on that ... a good news is a Dow futures up ... of the president's dating yesterday that\nThat uh plans are meeting with China again yeah and uh hopefully that's what it is helping to bounce back up because we looked at the bad news over the last couple of days with the\nFed dropping Thirteen hundred me said there's nothing you can do I mean the president can do to stop with the ... going to do right ... you're not going to stop at nothing he can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bonds ... on the regulation of attack that's more of a Congress that\nWhat can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're going to you know meet\nA yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market it's tempered today is the hope that of a deal it's going to be done\nYep yep yeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over those raw materials especially but terrorists overall we'll see what happens with trying to ... on the traps here's your forecast\nWe'll see that region today the Florida Panhandle the Big Bend area dry out\nUnder clear conditions good news for the region from Mother Nature we can look at the entire deep south and the mid west today but see clear conditions cooler conditions\nThere is a lead chapters some sprinkle some remaining showers today for the Delmarva up through New Jersey and into New York city but again conditions will be improving\nWe've got a chance where some snow and portions of the central plains\nFrom South Dakota into in Nebraska and over the central Iowa there'll be snow just north of the line and then I rain snow mix and as we get\nSouth into the system into Kansas and portions of western Missouri we'll see thunderstorms developing all rain but as you move into Oklahoma and central Texas light showers from the system there to look at shore National Weather forecast red eye radio\nI'm meteorologist John ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly\nHe moved to the left they didn't move to the right to be clear but\nAh on that\nOn on that point she is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain\nRight yeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with saying conservatives are welcome to New York right yes even the\nOnes that are there because we know that and and just being on you get ...\nYou can get away with that and New York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and you can\nBe a Democrat and say look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here's crazy were nuts right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to\nA historically speaking\nAnd soft Republicans\nI remember he said he represented stream conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights had no place in the state fast that's a huge number of people in New York they\nGet hired by the way um you know this and this is that that that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience it's not gun rights it's my rights\n\nAh yeah the gun doesn't advertising doesn't that doesn't have any rights and gun has no right to John doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's right yes\nI Am very interested I Want to get to this topic 'cause you happened to bring this up and I didn't know about this ... employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nDesk and you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this was in place in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen it also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk 'cause even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city\nAh for those who don't gamble or never Ben\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there at the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose\nAnd video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free now that uh uh just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nA ... but but for the bar it they'll move away from our town\nMan oh no no no no right now and bartenders robot brothels yeah\nI I guess by the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston didn't we yeah talking about and we did last week well I mean you know if you think about remember the old and I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine ... would make your ... yes yes I was going back to the Terminator two a security\nGuard making ... ... it was a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as tea to walk up behind him and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically\nUh order it you know and you know the type it in a you're\nGoing to answer your credit card and then all of a sudden the drinkers are going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\n... by automation you know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh\nBusiness uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business\nAnd you know tappers caught it where they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right right uh robots not going to do this well\nNeither one but I did here's the other point because I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nHead of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have\nTo is is that right 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction and wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can't be\nAngry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nOr can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] wow that's that but how how far do you go with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar so\nMy wife and I uh recently went to a place that had a robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it because it was often like they have\nA a a a what would you say it's there's there's there's Polk\nA a a a what would you say it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards were animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table and so we thought okay let's see how this works\nAnd it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right man that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right animation records that well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of seconds you're going to be a\nNightclub kind of setting and nightclubs are huge and and Vegas\nUm where they don't care they just want to drink it's not your pub writing where ... where the bartender right needs to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you\nIn Vegas it's not that it's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs\nAnd no one cares anything except about\nThe alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol\nOr it'll be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the whole version\nOf the robot bartender\nA year ago when you walk in your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert ... whatever I mean right from ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and\nYou say Alexa\nGive me a screwdriver there you go out and then she hands you Philips [laughter]\nNo I like to eat out of the whole idea [laughter] and then it's I suffer all alcohol no lights up drinking alcohol [laughter] a satellite dish or I Want to get drunk [laughter] hey six Ninety\nRed eye it's engine reporters brought you by Detroit\n...
