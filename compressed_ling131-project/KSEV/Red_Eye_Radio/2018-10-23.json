government\nI Can't tell you when the banks reading bailout how many people called up and said they shouldn't be bailing out the banks and should be bailing out me right off the government's role is to give you money while from somebody out\nAnd that's where this shift was for them you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservator voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the end of the Bush presidency or that the world is coming to Annette remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world\nYou know because the world is coming through that uh but the that that a a fear\nDrove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know if that's going to happen then right I Want mine so it became it's almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me you know thrown ain't right to throw it to me we were saying no do what you know one right way and\nAnd that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the parties and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for ten ten you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about

can't compare it if waiting times are double\nFor some procedures that's health care and ... finally healthcare if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago when he desperately call because they didn't have the technology in Canada to take care of his brain tumor right he would have died\nGolden side what they're going to pay for right and you don't get to say so in that our government makes the rules not only the payment but they make the rules yeah well\nAnd when you run intellectual honesty you go to a well what's his name the\nFormer labor secretary Robert

book or plan even resonate with them with kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I mean I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar on enough it's not enough so I'm not oh wait a minute by\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need you dolls and dollars a year at a giant helpless raging my child cutting out that's because\nThe idea is that we have you know we have too

you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there you know would be parents votes right now\nThey're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she promised she me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and to hell with my kid exactly as a thousand now and or\nBernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes as onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loan and of course for health\nCare yes Medicare fail to it yeah\nSo the what you can get me now is ... my kid you're fearful thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now all the way it will give me bolt will know give me the six to human don't getting six thousand dollars\nGive me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now give me an now gimme gimme gimme him exactly beginning that\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult but they don't care about the future they care about now\nSee they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not

Love that you are right [laughter] yeah [laughter] [laughter] so we're just like we were initially when we when we when we started with the program\nWe weren't going to attack since but it hadn't years into it we realized that everybody eight years from now yeah everybody eight years from now you will be taxed on it right and therefore\nNobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old now only be upset eight years later when we actually tax that having that yes exactly yeah yeah thank you\nAh well we appreciate the call it but but again you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want the the vote from so it's got to be free college for them\nIt's got to be a free money for you you know a Medicare for all\nAll of it for them to you and it has to be now you know you can't waste any time I remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking in or when they sign it rather they signed it into law\nAnd of course the rollout didn't happen right away but you have people calling in making appointments [laughter] I Know\n[laughter] where's your insurance will I

moderate and moderate conservatives we can't have that poverty empowered because they'd been blondes\nAbout what they believe in and we and we do believe I I Believe this is part of their statement we do believe that if they don't believe in the constitution if they don't believe in due process that they don't believe in the first amendment and they don't believe in the second amendment people are being blood and saying well then what makes you American\nYeah and I know sounds probably harsh just some people but if you don't believe in you and I talked about this for the longest time if you don't believe in the constitution if you don't believe in those basic tenants than what you actually believe in well and and\nWhat kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a your country to be you know you look at the the never Trump was the conservatives and I think the capital effect was was a you know something that was\nEye opening for\nA lot of them who realized okay a couple of times\nOr this president has shown a his efforts in terms of the highest court you and I by the way can can officially call this the Breitbart Andrew Breitbart effect\nYes because and twenty twelve just weeks before he died\nA we asked him as as we were talking to them why should we support a a moderate like Mitt Romney was inevitable Mitt Romney was going to become the nominee\nA appeared he would he even early that year or why should we do that and his answer was guys I'm a stone's throw as I sit here and talk to you from Scottish it's all about SCOTUS\nSo there is it different you can have a conservatives say well never Trump and maybe maybe I you know think about it and twenty twenty in terms of uh you know we'll look and see what it what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen\nI stayed home or whatever\nBut in terms of the mid term\nWhile yet they're supporting Trump there there are a couple of things at least Trump will do this on go to so I got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another construction\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is\nThey're they're you were going to have to build that Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it at a strong addition\nTo uh the Trump momentum ... to have conservatives who are any electrically driven who do know the constitution and do know and are extremely fearful of what came out of Democrats during the cabinet nomination which to them really has nothing to do with Trump\nBut it is all United in that same ideology not like that what you call it the republic because you've covered that a couple of times a Republican wall meanwhile we played a couple of of audio cuts from from President a former President Obama for a reason and that was\nI'm Still looking for what was the major issue because look if you look at cabinet what came out of capital and and I I specifically go back to a conversation that I had\nAt my at my family reunion and this was a gentleman who I talked to the relative by marriage OK is a professor at an extremely liberal college\nAnd from what I have known him as for the longest time because of other friends who know him\nA very very big liberal right very big liberal\nWe had the most amazing conversation in July most amazing conversation went on for over an hour\nAnd you know very quiet conversation just you know what do you think whatever and he just told me and said you don't have liberal I Am I said well I've heard that we never had a long discussion\nBecause I'm pretty liberal he goes the capitals are insane because they're not liberal I'm a liberal those maybe I'm an old 'cause I never thought I'd think of myself as an old time liberal and what I found out is he's ... he's a lot like for example of Camille paleo ... you know he's an old traditional\nA liberal and he talked about Trump because look you know Trump's of stuff that goes but look a lot of stuff that Trump says actually because when he goes too far actually helps us a little bit so people may claim they really care about are offended but they're not ... but\nThe fact is he goes my dad loves Donald Trump ... my dad died before Donald Trump ... ran in a won the presidency but my dad would have voted for Donald Trump because Trump's not a racist or not what you know it's not a racist\nAnd an incident goes but he goes our party because my party is killing itself\nAnd I wonder if I had a conversation with him today after capital 'cause Eric you don't want to you and I both know that the average Democrat I'm Talking about the work and the the working class Democrat who you know who lives in so many cities across the United states I Know who they are because I grew up with them my family\nPart of my family is from that working kind of a Democrat family I Know\nThey you know where Democrats came from in the north east you know we talked about Tim Russert ... you know and and uh when if you ever read any of his books I mean he came from a south buffalo Democrat Party but the very conservative mhm extremely conservative you know morally speaking and that's been passed down through generations\nYou'd think the average rank and file\nAverage working class Democrat related\nTo the Democrats saying that evidence doesn't matter that due process doesn't matter that the presumption of innocence doesn't matter\nYou know nobody's rallying around that anymore right now nobody's using that as a campaign thing no Democrats going out right now screaming always bullied her mhm if you if you voted dumb or if you bought her up\nOh we bullied her mhm if you if you voted dumb or if you bought a Republican in the Republicans going to vote for due process we cannot have due process we cannot have a presumption of innocence they may have been saying it two or three weeks ago they're not saying that now they can't sell it\nNow they can sell it to their own party so what are they telling\nBut showing Trump beer and maybe a little bit of the increased premiums for for a ... as they call the Trump carrying around a but at that actually going to have an effect right now no no I don't see that happening and it might have had more of an effect if the whole cabinet thing hadn't happened\nWhile because health care costs have been going up forever and they were going up during the Obama years I mean after they put the the even out Obamacare remember the first couple of years\nLook at the ... as we went through twenty sixteen the increase their it politically you can't get away with that anymore because it is it's going to go up people with ... with with an employer based health care no the costs are going up\nSo the only thing that resonates forget about saying well a Trump care is is Remy raising premiums nobody cares about that it's about what are you going to give me if you're going to you know again appeal to somebody who's on the left route not everyone but people\nBut you know something the the free stuff and we talked about that earlier with Cory bookers you know the new new program to maybe bonds and Camilla Harris over the weekend but that's more of a president show that that's more for twenty twenty that's not really you can as an individual Congress when you're there not walk and I go I'm going to get your free stuff\nThat's why Schumer is not making any noise when he announced ... days after the uh just a few days after the capital confirmation you know we're going to focus on health care well because nobody cares when it comes to the mid term yeah you know so what do you do\nThey they may when you're talking about an individual which is the presidential candidate it may be the focus is going to be there but there's just too many races to be focused on\nRight yep as we have a fascinating to me well I just say this is a fascinating you said earlier is could this be one of those unique midterms in terms of you know the numbers of love you know the average turnout or what demographics or what motivates anyone\nRemember twenty six theme was unique\nVery unique\nAnd we've changed as a nation since twenty sixteen\nThere are many things that have changed the left has ramped up their rhetoric and and the craziest over the top no telling what when we get past the midterm two weeks from today when we look back on what we're going to say eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have come to the molecular restructure giving them the ability of support pressures from higher horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nThere are cleaner synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine to photograph and somebody synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay
