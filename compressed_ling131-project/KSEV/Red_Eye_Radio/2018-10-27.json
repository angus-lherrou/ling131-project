I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie ... just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I wouldn't be so paranoid all the time\nWas six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would not be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm\nI'm not kidding I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I am a clear\nIt would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life I don't want to change it mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you\nAs your life I have a a a friend who uh a friend or family member who are back at one time was working for a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time in the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy out a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener things we are\nUm but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to\nSay no I couldn't have lost anyone else to do that\nThat would be the thing because you know people that what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so that\nIt it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone or I don't want to run my laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your ... let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a fulltime job is gonna be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life fight that right I don't know if I can say if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's\nLet's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like well like what I'm doing now I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nI'm I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited\nAbout that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was one dumped off it goes through my mind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is\nSo am I but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think uh like it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other titled how we that we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio someone somebody comes up until today\nA little shocking we work in an over warehouse for those that don't know what I mean we really I got it it's almost like we come to work at a warehouse where everybody's ready end of the show with ... and go home to what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift is the only time I work third shift\nI Try to be in a machine it mhm so the mentality sort of the same for so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal light you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought them one point six billion you only think I'm thinking about death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep debt the thinking adept at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nOh I've got all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but\nAnyway the guys told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly like one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night she went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets let me just talking about it was up AS Party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he was a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was look I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in with these\nPeople and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president is that security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nTime it was one of that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talking about the guy who won the big lottery right and was actually what the ah kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever right right right right when the money yeah\nYou know and so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed once you have security once ... once you have a policy like no I'm not a policy per se wants to read that field I think I heard people are security when I couldn't ... yeah\nYou know I it it would be a very different way of life I I don't know how you make it work eight six six Ninety right out\nOf touch with for the radio sold for

Gillum and former lobbyist Andrew Corey who arranged outings with undercover agents looking at a city corruption\nWere among the more than the one hundred pages of records Corey gate to the ethics commission which is investigating trips to Costa Rica and New York the Gillum looking twenty sixteen the Tampa Bay times reported Corey lawyer release a recording or the records\nYesterday after receiving a subpoena from the state ethics commission a last a week so\nThese these uh these text messages prove that that Gillum was aware of where the tickets were coming from yes exactly and and it was an FBI agent essentially that was posing as a developer so that would be at and the FBI was looking into uh\nSo that would be at and the FBI was looking into\nA you know any kind of misdeeds a there are at that level or any kind of possible corruption and so when you have something like that offered a the the practice would be no no there's no I don't know of any any kind of prosecutorial\nMeasures here being taken or or or even possible at this point but it's clear that he was caught well and was caught in a while it that's the that's the effect on the\nElection as I say if there is as you said earlier about ... where are you there was a preacher made in her mid show meeting whatever was when you said that so far no crime here but in say corruption in it's a corruption investigation going on they got caught lying about\nYeah because I you know it ... in terms of uh okay even a gift without a quid pro quo\nAre being demonstrated clearly because there's no evidence of a quid pro quo in other words a Gillum a return the favor by getting the ticket he also a gay consideration to there's a so called developer who was actually an FBI agent\nAnd and here's the quid pro quo there's no there's there's no one's saying that that was a there was a proven and by the question is is there a\nA a law against a gift\nA you know again that's for the legal setting and and ah and authorities to look into I don't know that any law has been broken\nAnd if you're not fueling at a TA Petra location today while you're in luck you can simply go to road king dot com on

simply went out at for Eighteen yesterday afternoon I said last night it was at a section for Eighteen ... or in the afternoon for him now\nAnd I said last night it was but it was actually for Eighteen ... or in the afternoon for him that late night because men if that's true [laughter] I think as midnight starts work again but this was this is the way that he should use Twitter already because it's simply putting words that\nWords in their own words from their own mouth yeah and it simply says I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd simply this bit of audio and video but it's audio for you since you're listening to radio from President Obama\nThere are a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those are federal illegally and those who are for them just respect the rule of law or and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWhich simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states pundits acted fund\nDocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nThere you go that that that I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nUh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the\nUh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion of all if that ever happens they're stopping at ... and Mexico City that's going to take a few minutes um but\nAs we've said this is the time\nA couple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats say this is the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge\nThe Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what I Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plan and we talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got that than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and\nIf you are the party of open borders have the guts to sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people and that's what I think the president should say the man he's already halfway there with this yep you're now and and by the way you can you\nCan get him you can get Feinstein how many do you mean hello to write\nThat down so that really over the last Twenty years in some exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly play those make that comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is the press fact checking to make sure that\nObama really said that er and they just laying low challenge the press go after the media right and say this is one thing why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think now and what they thought then why don't you why why don't\nYou ask them if they want to open border it's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with ah with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I go to the moderator our view of my time if I could just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people and that's basically what we have now I mean some field we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion but you know half measure so either you believe in open borders or you know been forced right\nIt's about time after Thirteen Years Thirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy when that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable\nTo challenge them to scare them to tell the American people and don't stop it you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted to make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue again yep\n[noise] for on a track here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of an east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva where the heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas\nAll the way up through well at least Long Island\nAnd then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio a good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nWhere there have been significant amounts of rainfall and flooding over the past week look for the possibility of some white snow flurries\nOff along the great lakes region mainly near upstate New York as high pressure of stairs and cooler Canadian air and moisture from the south collide your national forecast from right our radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\n\nThe last time I think a ... there was a cowboy which that it's politically incorrect right now here in Texas oh this was an almost required well this was in New York this is Thirty years ago I were you wearing a gun um yeah I probably\nWill make it on and that that's still no that's not allowed to say that was that is actually probably illegal [laughter] the fake gun the also as a kid I can remember going out as what would it be because we wanted to make it simple mhm I don't remember ever\nGetting had probably ... I remember putting on that one of the plastic masks with the little string but\nI I don't remember what I mean what are the only thing I remember wanting to be is again remember a hobo mhm you just take the stake in the little things you put them behind and yet ... put shark will charcoal on your face but right was it which is that politically incorrect\nYou can't use charcoal well it was to make it was if you had like a a beard right get like you had your like if I like uh like it was a five days growth as if you know they shave every five days ... exam on but now that politically incorrect you can't go as as a no\nAid temporarily displaced or maybe permanently displaced Traveller\n[laughter]\nAway word or what about the the you know typically what I see at at my door on a on Halloween is is these days it's super hero\nYou know or\nThe the you know the little girls will wear like a you know like a butterfly costume that's actually one of my granddaughters is going and she's got this really cool butterfly costume that she was going is about\nMy my grandson going as a um a pumpkin his dad and I are trying to make it an evil pumpkin but his mom was fighting me on that\nSo you know she just wants a regular pumpkin once the next Wednesday that or is it yeah yeah yeah well that I\nI've got to go to sleep all my life so nobody bought it in my neighborhood you turn the lights off nobody bothers you about shepherd that energy and and I was like code\nI mean I I Love every ... if uh the Halloween what once every uh four to four or five years and I'm On the friday and Saturday Night I stay home I Love it\nAnd I and I saw an out some Taliban friday night because of leap year horizons wanting to run out she's that you write that blows that so I mean one mhm\nUh but I I Love it and I and I absolutely love I've got grandkids so now so it's just this great the you know the kids and the kids on especially in the weekend they come to the doors mean they'll come until ten o'clock at night and and I just love it but I did see the stories where some towns\nAre threatening to rent to teenagers to just see that who who tricking treat her trick\nOr treat like an age limit you have to be an age limit that you can do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nI I don't care if the older kids come to my dad did I get a little unclear I Would I don't hear\nAll of a sudden you'll you open the door especially like at nine nine thirty a little bit later it's a bunch of high school kids yeah\nI think that's fantastic yeah\nYeah my neighbor Bob came over he's eighty six I gave him [laughter]\nHe was dressed all man at every year it's like the neighbors get to get hired who's running out of candy and he got a call I got to bail out what all I ever running out of candy I I I get but I mean I\nAlways buy weights while I don't even end up closing the door I end up sitting out on the porch and the neighbors come over and it's just a great time and I don't carry you'll have to you know you'll have and the high school kids come out a little bit later and and but everybody is done by nine thirty ten\nWe um we we we kind of have a it depends\nOn you know again if it's a weekend or not my granddaughter's or we'll go to you know we'll go to their house and walk with them in the neighborhood sometimes I it just depends on what they're doing you know they're getting older now my oldest granddaughter is Thirteen so you\nKnow I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it well it ... but then we come home and then you know that's it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late and then we hand out candy so changes when you have grandkids\nWell you know it's like when when uh we we talked about this before when well you know seven or eight year olds and finding their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld that I'm candy just a couple of weeks ago again\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy and I didn't care about the Halloween costume where I Would go on an even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we'd coal we'd go up to ... we we we'd had Fifteen blocks I come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about what the candy\nCostume could care less yeah socializing could care less mhm get me the candy\nYeah right so of course that's my that's that's my tendency now we used to take a ... now is you know the high blood sugar I've got to stay away from candy penance for being evil as we would use pillow cases\n[laughter] and I grew up poor because they were bigger [laughter] no they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never looked\nI still do but I don't have those on my bed I had a hell of a field with candy it's much much\nBetter if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity might be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] bags huge fan I that pillows and that's a good idea yeah yeah it's it's\nI remember one time when my son uh he was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen and he and his buddies ah had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them like we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm but it's really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink some yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone\nMean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out\nWe weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone and the boys were just so disappointed so was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king sized pillow case\nWe didn't walk we drove us and we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys\nTell me [laughter] and all those ... that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever\nAsked by we had a very much like mine didn't we get well I I was just you know of wondering now can you where is that is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom asks are out there that the George W mass route during that time\nThat Ron resident the bottom and I mean you're probably still the Nixon mass yeah but I mean I've not seen a Trump\nMass you know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask I don't think I ever went to the ...\nYou know there was ... there was harder you know because of the big ... remember that yeah [laughter] I don't think it wasn't Gerald Matt\nTrim an Asian or why are we discriminate against have second ahead a very mundane right alongside of remember the next ... everybody remembers\nThe next ... oh yeah Robert Johnson I bet not have to go watch point right and\nWe've been talking about [laughter] I mean we didn't mention Clinton because of course there was yeah there was a Clinton out yeah yeah\nSo I'm trying to think I think there was a I don't know if there was a Hillary mask I'm not that she was president but you know of course being first lady I have seen the Trump in a T shirts yeah it's a pumpkin with oh yeah yeah yeah\nRight yeah which is actually that's pretty funny which is pretty funny but then again which were which were that out or when people get ticked off where are people that sensitive to help pay the okay that I live out of the understood humor where somebody would actually get beat up for wearing that will\nBe interesting to see if you hear stories of that where people refuse to give candy to a kid dresses truck because by the way it could go either way\nRight yeah I mean a baby dressed as Trump Baby Trump would be kind of funny cute or but also could be kind of you know making fun of the president but\nWe'll see if people refused candy we're we'll wait for the story week it's red\nFish the engine report is brought to you by Detroit ...
