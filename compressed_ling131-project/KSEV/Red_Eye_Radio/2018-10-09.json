the Supreme Court is now gone [noise] of course that's predict right\nAh it it it is and I mean that's the way when when you're lost or anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I said I Would I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this was something the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I Would nit picking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but uh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being at the question about conservative justices cheap and use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on\nIt's the liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation versus not conservatives who was the past conservative legislation\nIt's originally construction and it's also been they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text and the constitution\nAnd say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication that it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative\nThe kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not to change it changing the constitution it's up to a are changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment prop ... and it's that simple\nAnd we need to as conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that\nThat it is we the people who are elected representatives that need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge and become legislators\nAnd we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nAnd say a conservative judge it's like no no they're actually not a conservative judge that's not what we're looking for we're not fighting the same fight just the part of an opposite of the liberal they wish for their justice is\nTo make liberal law\nWe do not which are judges to mate\nConservative law that does not exist we want them to uphold\nThe constitution uphold the law\nAnd interpret it and leave it up to the legislature to make the law and we are not explaining that good enough every day\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds\nAnd someone I woke up yesterday I started thinking what did Democrats thinking the issue is what it shouldn't take and go after Trump out what the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking on the Democrats going to jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the the Obama administration that and rates on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the great ... start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always used them even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to a certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you have a major case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger I I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stayed in during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even in the story that was being did God\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting that too as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you know what's what's the Democrats issue what do they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal\nBobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of ah Louisiana mhm two thousand two thousand sixty Democrats try some self restraint\nNow I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] I thought it was up there was right [laughter] F\nA it's not certain the Democrats I'm sort of read parts of it because I actually started laughing during a ah it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sick here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but it's they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and push to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice Kavanaugh\nAnd a swap with Clinton their positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on his public duty is\nThis is more a than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to live as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to an act of the most extreme agenda it could pass and in dead to search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't went over ... Christians are rather committed supporters\nBut a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base Democrats can support gay marriage

tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now have you lost and you know already on the ... yeah okay\n[noise] and that's not going to happen\n\nYeah I lost you when\nRight after we started laughing [laughter] [laughter] I thought he respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not gonna happen no it's not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nIt it can happen and you look we as we said this after twenty six team we got this one Democrat because I find this fascinating I I find the ... election that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you'll election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of the Washington and here we we we need to\nHow's your weight we we have to get outside of the Washington and here we we we need to we need to go into the heartland and see how people are really thinking there and they really said that some twenty sixteen we have to cherish reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction\nPlayed opposite here they'd gone more in saying now they'd gone more authoritarian they'd gone more a dare I say using the F. word\nOr with the fascists mind set out there while claiming that they are the anti fascist that's the most interesting point though\nYeah um and and if that's not going that's not going to change\nOr what it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of wind it up what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far left liberals\nThose that are really I mean then they're leading the party now I mean I think after the uh capital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now\nUm but nonetheless what would bring them back\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most in same part of um I mean we can we can giggle at at a governor Jindal you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford\nA script\nThan his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nA especially when they are they stuck and they can't get out of it and just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims\nBecause which was not the cause of it like this is this is what that's why it went for once you leave the Trump is the cause of it Trump stop the cause of it easy effect of it and and so\nTell me if you think that would change just to pay for the sake of the argument I Know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately and Mike Pence became president\nWe would have had a beautiful pool by our world that's where I'd everywhere would go back where being normal we could invite Michael Moore onto the show and we would have a love fest right\nUm well [noise]\n... yeah right right he sitting in your lap not mine [noise] um [laughter] ...\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but got was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs so and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the [laughter] I don't I really really\nDo well our churches are ... well enough that simply said they don't have they they can't handle the stress okay they're not enjoying\nThat does what you had to go without yeah okay yeah that's actually what our men are actually true it was an engineering fun [laughter]\nThat's what it was so here's the question if case it\nBecame president tomorrow do think it would change you know it would not know if John McCain were still alive and ran for president and one would have changed you
