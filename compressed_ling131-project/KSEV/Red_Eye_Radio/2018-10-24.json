apparent winning ticket in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently\nStarted after winning just just that would\nBe so funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what that person going or group of people going\nThrough right now they know talk about freak out mode\n... there's someone wrote the story again you know because they they did this series on\nA on cable I Know ... stories of people winning the lottery and ... just ended horribly I'm an someone to destroy here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize the word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nThen people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it\nKills mine for them to get up so I mean that's ... that's the psychology\nBehind it oh wait a minute if everybody has a right to my earn the money and then they have a double rights to my non earned wacky money especially because how is that prize constituted by me\nBuying a ticket and you won the prize [laughter]\nStill have it a sense of entitlement rabbit to the Supreme Court and I've got to do a lot of power yeah I actually you know it is\nBut um you know that's that's a dynamic especially you know people who are famously wealthy but forget about that people who wins something tens don't burn it [noise] people get jealous very easily [noise]\nBack I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that a way if you fulfilled every request\nThere would've been much more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery in the day to be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I mean it would take any thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money because after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere\nAround what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent you know of the overall prize a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars that's a ton of money here richer than Mitt\nRomney already you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\nYou know the story always goes he was one of the least rich guys in the Senate\nUm and and you woke up richer than a minute [laughter] and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and parking anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to edit gossip just place of Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I wouldn't be so paranoid all the time\nWith sticks on I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would a high end there would be a bit disturbed\nThere's there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I ... it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life I don't want to change mhm\nI and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who are ... at one time was working for a a multibillion\nUm and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps\nFour hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we were talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things we are um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth is more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody\nElse to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though\nTo know I could have lost anyone on that do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo that it it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally in in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you got that kind of six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the more your life your life is going to change managing the money\nBecause of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of found what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so there's jobs gone well I don't want to run my laws\nThere are a lot about riding the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax\nThe giver has to pay the gift right well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it away that's what I meant so going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I haven't gone my life is life fight right I don't know if I can tell you if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going you write a play out of a\nLet's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like well like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life well yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life [laughter] I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nI'm\nNot saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know I Would want to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I ... on mine but it's still a thoughts are worth talking\nThis is one dumped ought to go through a mine but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that about one more point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think uh like it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other time allow that we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I ever really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up I doodle today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really got it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse at the end of the show we grab our lunch pail isn't going to say that's what the feeling is it like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist mhm so the mentality sort of the same for us\nSo I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal like were you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about a death [laughter]\nRight but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking adept at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but\nAnyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets to be talking about I was up this party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a building there so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motivations here's here's the problem with being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for\nYou've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's that of your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that security detail\nThat is is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean\nAnd so you're going to have to be very careful because they are ... girl threats against you all the\nTime one of the story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talking about the guy who won the big lottery ran was actually what the ah kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever right right right right when the money yeah you\nKnow so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed once you have security once ... once you have a possibly what not I'm not a policy per se what are we learning Irish people are security when I couldn't have ... yeah you know I\nIt it would be a very different way of life I I don't know how you make it work eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told ... must be read\nWhere

late night\nBecause men [laughter] he gets up at midnight starts work again\nBut this was this is the way that he should use Twitter already because it's simply putting words that words in their own words from their own mouth yeah and it simply says I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd simply this bit of audio and video but this audio for you who lives in terms that radio from President\nObama\nIn general and welcoming people here in the United states but those who said or the country illegally and those who are for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWhich simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states son detected fund documented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently do generally unlawfully become immigrants in this country\nThere you go that yes it that I agree with President Obama won a hundred percent\nOr you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens\nThey're stopping at bucking in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we've said this is the time a couple of weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now for the Democrats do believe this\nIs the time to challenge the Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what\nI Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders will then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plan and we talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or\nIs it like we all believe that your party in the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the\nGuts to sell that\nTo the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say he's already halfway there within yeah you're\nNow and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many oh yeah hello to write\nDown so vividly over the last Twenty years at south exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly play those make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is depressed fact checking to make sure that\nObama really set that or they just\nLaying low challenge depressed go after the media right say this is what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think now and what they thought then\nWhy don't you why why don't you ask them if they want to open border gets the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do to survive a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with uh with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I should the moderator our view of my time if I could just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders\nAltogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people end up basically what we have now I mean some field we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you've never been forced right\nAnd it's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats in the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge them to dare them to tell the American people and don't stop it you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue will get yep\n[noise] for on a track here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane Wilma in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those ... to western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and severe weather in place for the region another whether maker will be a surface alone near the southern tip of Texas\nSo a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and the below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nCircus slow moving through the great lakes region into New England\nWill bring snow showers for portions of northern Ohio up in through upstate New York so along the lake from Cleveland into buffalo I Ninety look for some potential snow today more likely though as you get into northern New England where six to ten inches of snow is forecast for northern Maine\nA reminder winters on its way your national forecast from red eye radio on meteorologist John traveling so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe last time I think a ... for the was a cowboy which that is politically incorrect right\nKnow here in Texas\nOh this was almost required well this was in New York this is Thirty years ago I were you wearing a gun\nUm yeah I'd probably do make it on and that that's still no that's not allowed to say that was actually probably illegal [laughter] the fake guns they also as a kid I can remember going out as would would be because we wanted to make it simple mhm I don't remember ever getting\nHad probably ... I remember putting down to one of the plastic masks with the little string but I I don't remember what the what are the only thing I remember wanting to be is again remember a hobo\nMhm you just take the steak and the little thing you put them behind and yet ... foot shark will charcoal on your face the right words of what is that politically incorrect you can't use charcoal well it was to make it was if you had like a a beard you might get like you had to be here like if I like that like it was a five days growth\nAs if you know they shave every five days ... exam on but now that politically incorrect you can't go as as a no a temporarily displaced or maybe permanently displayed to travel or\n[laughter]\nA wayward out what about the the you know typically what I see at at my door on a on Halloween is to these days it's super hero\nYou know or\nThe the you know the little girls will wear like a you know like a butterfly costume that's actually one of my granddaughters is going and she's got this really cool butterfly costume that she's going about\nMy my grandson going as a um a pumpkin his dad and I are trying to make it an evil pumpkin but his mom was fighting me on that [noise] so you know she just wants a regular pumpkin one ... is a next Wednesday or is it yeah yeah yeah\nWell that I I've got to go to sleep all my life so nobody bought it in my neighborhood you turn the lights off nobody bothers you I mean I Know that's about ... and put him on and and I was a code\nI mean I I Love every ... if uh the Halloween what once every uh four to four or five years ...\nI'm On the friday and Saturday Night I stay home I Love it and I and I saw an out some towel on friday night because of leap year horizons wanting to announce she's that you write that blows that swung one mhm\nUh but I I Love it and I am I absolutely love I've got grandkids now so it's just the ... the you know the kids and the kids on especially in the weekend they come to the doors and they'll come in to ten o'clock at night and and I just love it but I did see the stories where some towns are threatening a rat to teenagers\nTo see that who who tricking treat her trick or treat like an age limit you have to be an age limit that you can do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nI I don't care if the older kids come to my dad I I don't care I mean I don't hear all the sudden you'll you open the door especially like at nine nine thirty a little bit later it's a bunch of high school kids yeah\nI think that's fantastic yeah now my neighbor Bob came over he's eighty six I gave him [laughter]\nHe was dressed and I'm old man oh at every year it's like the neighbors get to get hired who's running out of candy and you've got to have on got to bail out while I ever running out of candy I I get but I mean I always my weight while I don't even end up closing the door I end up sitting out on the porch and the neighbors come over and it's just a\nGreat time and I don't carry you'll have you'll you'll have and the high school kids come out a little bit later and\nAnd but everybody's done by nine thirty ten\nWe um we we we kind of have a it depends on you know again if it's a weekend or not my granddaughter's\nUh we'll go to you know we'll go to their house and walk with them in the neighborhood sometimes I it just depends on what they're doing\nYou know they're getting older now my oldest granddaughter is Thirteen so you know I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it well it ... but then we come home and then you know that it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late\nAnd then we hand out candy so changes when you have grandkids\nWell you know it's like when when uh we we talked about this before when well you know seven or eight year olds and defining their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld bent on candy just a couple of weeks ago again\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy ... and I didn't care about the Halloween costume\nRight would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we'd go read a lot too I mean we we had Fifteen blocks I come home with grocery bags of candy even at that age and all I cared about what the candy costume couldn't care less yeah socializing could care less ... get me the candy\nYeah right so of course that's my that's that's my penance now we used to take a and and now it's you know the high blood sugar I'd get out of stay away from candy penance for being evil as we use pillow cases\n[laughter] and I'm not going to report because they were bigger [laughter] no [laughter] they were stronger yeah [laughter] that's right yeah I've never ...\nI still do but I don't\nHave those on my bed I had a hell of a building with candy it's much much\nAbout if that if if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity might be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] bag huge back I that pillows and that's a good idea yeah yeah it's it it\nI remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen and he and his buddies ah had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and then we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm but it's really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink some yeah yeah yeah and so the step there ... it was publications down in the driveway we're only about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone\nI mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in\nCame out in that regard I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone and the boys were just so disappointed so my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king size pillow cases\nAnd we didn't walk we drove us and we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys\nTell me [laughter] and I felt the location of that night it was one of the greatest nights ever\nAt us but I mean they're very much like mine didn't wait yes well I I was just you know I'm Wondering how can you where is it is it okay to where Trump mask\nBecause remember the bottom asks are out there that the George W mass route during that\nTime well president then there are a lot of them I mean you're probably still the Nixon masked yeah but I mean I'm not saying that Trump mass you know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise]\nI don't think I ever went to the ... you know it was Reagan who will be there was harder you know because of the big chi right\nRemember that [laughter] I don't think there was a hero to map\nThe scrimmage shouldn't a\nWire we discriminate against ... a very long time ago and I don't remember the next ... everybody remembers the next ... oh yeah ... Johnson [laughter] you know I bet not\nHave to go watch point bread and wait a minute [laughter] but I mean we didn't mention Clinton because of course there was yeah there was an out yeah yeah so I'm trying to think I think there was a I don't know if there was a Hillary masked ... not that she was president but you know of course being first lady\nI haven't seen the Trump can a T shirts the pumpkin with\nOh yeah yeah yeah right right yeah which is actually pretty funny which is pretty funny but then again would you where would you aware of that out or when people get ticked off yeah our people back sensitive and okay ... okay that I Love the under the humor where somebody would actually get beat up for wearing that will be interesting to see if\nYou hear stories of that where people refuse to give candy to a kid dresses truck because by the way it could go either way right yeah I mean a baby dressed as Trump Baby Trump would be kind of funny to mhm uh but also could be kind of you know making fun of the president\nBut\nWe'll see if people refused candy we're we'll wait for the story week it's red eye\nEngine reporters brought to you by\nDetroit but de de Fifteen is designed to provide its peak power in ... between one thousand M.
