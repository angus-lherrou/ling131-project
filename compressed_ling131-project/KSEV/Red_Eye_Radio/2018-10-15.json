like he got rid of it just got that that's why I asked ... to act out of it in a larger lung capacity now where is the choice for that and why is Nick how can we have yet to go with that he helped me there\nWell I was ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have courage drugs they're afraid you know the poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as well I don't know if that's accurate or not because we have problems with the polls\nBut you make another great point Gerry which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president\nAnd all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust her own which is how about the Democrats they complain about them Kevin they voted ... you know the four votes are going to be that every single time it doesn't matter you sure you don't ever see them deviate\nBut even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who deviate from what you thought they believed in\nAgain you're not supposed to question them on every single Lucian now they don't even answer it but you couldn't even trust John Roberts is good that Supreme Court justice who else who's the author one Souter that age uh Bush appointed I mean he wound up being a disaster [noise]\nSo we we we have this problem and thanks so much for your call Jerry the problem is that people are not as you point out John McCain was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust try to get off the worry when you vote for a Democrat when you vote for a liberal when you vote for the leftist that's what you're going to get\nYour vote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was gonna come down on the side of Kevin I was worried when she was going to give her speech you I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd they often you have people like Jeff Flake right to life dimension him or he didn't even run again and again so unpopular hates another one that aids Trump so much and you couldn't miss your hands on what did he do uh a woman a costume which looks like she may have been part of the ... gang but I don't want to say if if it's not accurate [noise]\nYou know some of them were paid did you did you watch them by the way calling U.S Supreme court a truck stop his nomination on these people losing it or what\nAnd that's why for those are just joining us now I said in the very first our we have a civil war going on\nBut we can't even trust the less sensitive juries question they run as Republicans concern is whatever and then they get in there I don't know they want to be in favor of the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them and that's why I say this for years and it's good time to say to the audience now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles we had a series of values and we said oh with those values then the Republican Party makes sense and if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being a Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it\nWhat's the point of John McCain you know changes his mind or voted or what he said he would do\nOr Jeff Flake because he's angry at President Trump and we can go down the list the others like that\nBut you don't see the Democrats doing that now you could say you got mentioned in there but heck didn't Trump wind West Virginia by forty points or something like that I don't think he had much choice and he tends to be somewhere in the middle but that's unusual\nFor the most part they deviate and that's why I say ... and we'll take your calls\nMe if the Republicans lose the house of representatives\nGood luck to next two years they're going to have subpoenas they're gonna have hearings to go into a peach President Trump is no doubt in my mind if they have a majority of people to do that in the house representatives they'll have hearings they'll try to teach you judge Kavanaugh\nWhich is going to be chaos and I am sure one of the color set up a number of colors that you guys go out there and vote but he ... you better get your friends to vote this is serious stuff\nThis country will never be the same if these guys getting power and it doesn't matter if President Trump when's the next time if you have a house representatives that trying to destroy him and the people as Lindsey Graham pointed out they only care about power\nI mean I'm not going to say they don't have any principles any use but I'm just trying to say they think they're so right that so arrogant but anything goes and you saw it and you watched it at the Kevin over here and they they didn't care about ruining his reputation and in fact as I pointed out before they didn't even care about the Ford and there's so much about her she was just the pollen\nAnd when the phone is like Cory Booker said ah do you think she's making this up you didn't even care she made enough\nTo hold out winning your point of view or in your case running for
