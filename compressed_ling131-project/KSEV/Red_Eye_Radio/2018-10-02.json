forgive minutes opinions because I wasn't sure what all the details worst why hesitated to do it it is the old ... ... it has the confidence well no there is a confidence today that exist\nOf promoting the\nYour opinion and being vehement and passionate about it\nAnd after about ten seconds you go you really don't know the issue at all here do you not talking about you Robert I'm Talking about other people that exist out they're mainly on the left I see it but the ignorance is even greater than just\nThe news [noise] truly I I was when I Would say when I was a bill collector in college I understood with the three branches of government where\nI went to twelve years and I went to twelve years of school everybody wants to twelve years some of the vast majority of the population went to twelve years of school so I joined the\nEighth grade I Love your with the three branches of government work\nIs that many ... seven and five percent of the people in the United states do not they can't name one they can't name what is it all branches of the federal government right\nIf you can't name all ... there's three of them we all know but if you can't name all three of them then you don't understand the separation of powers the majority of people Seventy five percent of people could not named the freedoms and the first amendment to the constitution\nOf the United states\nThe majority couldn't name ... uh you know a ... more than one freedom which was no no the majority couldn't name one freedom\nWhich is freedom of speech they couldn't even they couldn't even\nName that that's more we understand how people may not know it in the story when that we understand that's why we exist and we understand that a lot of people call and say we learn stuff about it and so therefore we can go out and we can form our opinions and that's the way that you should do it but it goes more than just the news stories it's that after a while I was in\nThe multiple sources for more for my own opinion\nAbsolutely that's what we always say don't believe let's go do your own research ship\n'em but as far as the computer does show I'm sixty years old I've done killed ... so I'm not really that good\nWith things [laughter] I'm trying to wait on it is that what it is that I didn't know what I wrote a new computer loud because it just died was that the Internet that the Internet's fall fall\n[laughter] and I was [laughter] kind of a certain level of sixty dollars for a ...\nWhite mark computer dry cleaning up after the first one ... and then they said they could have been picked for thirty call more than ... on the computer [laughter] oh wow I log on to buy a laptop I'm number one with a standalone computer goes are cheaper law\nYeah Robert thank you so much for accomplish that you know when when I used to when I used to work or the six days a week working twelve hours a day at the steel mill\nA A R I remember that uh I I remember it because a lot of my work third shift remember listening to Larry King of the radio was listening to music as well as in Larry King ah there really wasn't much other talk radio at that time\nBut you know gas or whatever else and you know paying attention to news reading books reading the newspaper I wanted to know what was going on but it isn't the fact just to let you know Robert we understand\nThat people are busy I Know some of my really good friends part of the reason I'm good friends with them\nIs they never listen to me they really don't know a ... they're so busy in their career where they really don't know them a new show what's going on like a lot of our audience does because you're really into whether you're passionate about it for many of you as a hobby which is I think it's a great hobby to have\nA but the fact is they're not out there promoting and opinion that's to me the problem the confidence of the arrogant or or you have a particular narrative in your head of what's right so you pick up bits and pieces\nAnd you ... claim that you have absolute authority on a particular topic when after five seconds anybody in the know will tell you you don't know what you're talking about right and that is the area and not having the lack of knowledge on a particular area\nThere's too many things for people to know there's things\nOn on topics that I have no clue of and I'm not going to try to be us my way through it I'm not going to go into the mechanic today\nAt one time I was able to tear apart an engine and put it back together again I couldn't even attempt that today and if I went in and started pointing out tubes and started saying well this does that and that does this and this does that\nA modern day mechanic would look at me and say you're full of it you have no idea what's going on and that's the problem that I see people that are so confident or maybe it's arrogant\nTo believe that they know exactly what's going on and after five seconds anybody that with any critical thinking skills will say I don't have a clue well what does that come from there it's it's the citizen has greatly empowered by enact a or acting on\nInformation real information but\nThere's great risk to this country by people acting on lack of information that's a different\nUh being ignorant for whatever reason whether you just choose not to follow the news or you're too busy or whatever it is is one thing acting regardless of how ignorant ignorant you are on the topic\nIs the difference in today's world not just issuing an opinion anymore on social media remember we saw last friday that's why we're still talking about cabinet all it is to get in your face or what they call them direct approach\nAnd the meaning is helping\nMedia is NBC and all of them are helping spread the lives just\nAnd all of them are helping spread the lives just by giving them a forum\n[noise] you're you're there's two problems so there are people that are ignorant and willfully ignorant and wanting to form an opinion based on their ignorance and then there's those in the media that understand the ignorance and understand if we lie to them and as we said before and we talked about this last week lined by omission\nOr newspaper articles will say we didn't lie it there's not an entree thing here yeah but you let this out and you let that out for it which gives a completely different slant of the story and leads people in a different direction from the truth that is a lie that's lined by omission\nRight\nAnd they understand as we said Jonathan Gruber says that it we can lie to these people I'm sure we can lie to the stupid American public\nWill remember buzzfeed politic claim or a disclaimer on that story they knew they couldn't verify we have no way to verify any of this we're ... we're going with it anyway that's centrally what NBC did yesterday\nWith the the third accuser\nAs she's being called they gave her an interview when they admitted as a news organization they could not corroborate any of that and as her own story was falling apart yes and she backed out of her own story and then NBC nightly news decides\nNot to run an an actual official part of the proceeding\nAnd that is the woman who was brought in the prosecutor was brought in to do the questioning issued a member NBC ignores what's real and put on display in front of all of\nAmerica or the few people still watching something that is that they themselves say we're not able to corroborate any of this the New York times\nInterviewed dozens of individual individual people and could not find anyone with first hand knowledge of her claim and she's now walking back her own claim now that doesn't matter\n[noise] ah we don't tend to go to a call but Mike in Indiana wanted to say the Feinstein her ... she wants a presumption of innocence in the letter lake that's beautiful yeah because there's more evidence there there's why circumstantial evidence and a presumption of wait a minute\nSomebody one of the Democrats most likely leak that no I Want the presumption of innocence mhm that's a great point yeah eight six six Ninety ride I\nFear tangent report is brought to
