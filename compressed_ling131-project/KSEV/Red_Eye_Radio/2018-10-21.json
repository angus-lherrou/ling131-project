with\nAnd it's been a very hard for people to\nPick someone who knew side which is a statement of the times that we live in that people are so angry on both sides that they couldn't even sit down and have a cup of coffee with them All right so that's the news that the order of the day and you're supposed to pick both you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call in an age thing\nThe pit bulls you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call it an eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark how are you there I'm here I'm okay a lifetime is that John K shake I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I don't really apply to a public and yeah\nShe did a play [laughter] while you balance the budget\nAnd you know ever going to balance a budget that should they should run against Trump or you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight and some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably wouldn't stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values can serve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't\nDon't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\n[noise] um and now I don't have coffee with is Nikki Haley I Believe she\nAs an elected as a global perspective that I have a degree in anthropology and I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet\nThat we have to learn to get along with each other and\nSo those are my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... ... amazing because he leaves surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them having an a very courageous not being afraid to say like it is\nShe's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I don't have someone\nWith a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and clearly we can be a good\nA good companion a good name for a good partner in the global perspective I think that's very important\nSo thanks for his ideas and\nWe'll let you hold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer sheriff question but\nI don't like John ... says something about the guy\nA says he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that was years ago so that's not fair that's rumor or something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you like\n[noise] oh I can tell us budget I mean\nWe we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that you don't want something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign I mean that's all sides of the aisle you know and it's just going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nHas been there the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy\nAnd where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of government spending and we ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember the woman or during the Obama campaign the first one said\nObama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to we're going to have a stash damage stash came out of a stash right she he was going to personally pain so people don't know that that the government has no money in its own\nA thank you very much for your call very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're a national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook you will be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S and it's expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nMost of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas where we couldn't see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extreme southern Texas\nAnd portions of West central Texas saturate the release than other ranch today your winter outlook on today's forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm more I Want to know who you think should be the Democratic nominee\nWho used to sit down and have to\nBe a good idea I think the\nIt is quite possible that the Democrats can take back the house and as I said for the last few nights if they take back the house\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do try to impeach Kevin I'm trying to teach Trump\nWith hearings would subpoena powers are we calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun [noise]\nNo I think it's going to get ugly I personally for that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I'd probably say that\nThat wouldn't be crazy I mean I I didn't leave anything forward said to me I didn't believe any of it it didn't sound credible to me [noise]\nUm [noise] I get a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nOn it I was at one of the what the guys that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got old yeah nobody had heard we've got you\nKnow I was going to say it it seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case I just think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side uh Spartacus both her and I call them that because there is on the yeah the Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't do that assault on her\nAll those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a little difficulty with\nThe horror of what was it really was was he was\nYeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when it came out and said that I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do I have but that's what they are they added we yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely all all that being called back to\nWell thanks so much to him and uh yeah Joe Manchin would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage a winning seems so nice and and reasonable I think he is going to win but someone who is less than ... and I said I'd mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the each one is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense as I've said on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reason why I lost in none of them will be her if I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson and she looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife\nBut few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns out of high profile Clinton presidents with only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly as low key fundraisers and low key 'cause you can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss with F. one party officials said yeah I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want to the campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that it's less popular than Donald Trump the strategy is that that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best possible impact and have time decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think people who've been part of our push to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good things that they're not being visible you wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I liked that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run you know like our Sam's she could run forever right between the have\nForever Sam's forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually I can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for rock Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if she runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of them same number thirty three thirty nine mark ouch they're filling in on red our radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality\nUnlike mineral Orioles synthetic oils how can the molecular restructure giving it the ability of support pressures from Ira horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures\nIt also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nVery clean or synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and somebody synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is the service of shell wrote ...\nOr ... year old too old for that sort of the road [noise]\n\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coach that goes from the comfort of your guests have find out more dish revised drug ... from a drudge dot Gov\nIt's easy to guess what's inside of the trunk\nLoads of products because back in time and many never consider what's inside the trucker the men and women who keep business moving\nUp support community and the parents of providers brothers and sisters and neighbors inside these commitments delivery job well done\nPretty sacrifice to preserve and\nSchauer into the engine oil works as hard as you\nTiming you know you've got plenty to manage on them around and you're going to remain crises limit on how to find a way we've gotten all you need more ... more than a\nGrain coffee more and claims Halloran rather than an average pilot find a trash can service on line and on them rather than twenty more you want it and we've got a pilot flying J and get him my time it out because I got hard getting real time reserves salaries last march\nDid you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver them may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you were someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nWhere and how ... can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on St Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's truck respond dot org ... band together for a better tomorrow\nIf he were trucking industry professional then you immediately and then now and there's no one more note and the readers of fleet owner magazine written for executives and managers sleep on air provides information on operation maintenance regulations and information technology but that's\nAll here with his monthly premium location and the other dot com website has all the way it seems and information and keep your head operating efficiently industry experts to award winning writer and columnist I Wonder if that number one source of tracking information in North America [noise]\nInformation of women are negative reports swans videos international can use it more easily accessible from the donor dot com and if you're looking to buy or sell like try to flee owner ... towers I asset nation fleet ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Tomball", "day": "21"}
