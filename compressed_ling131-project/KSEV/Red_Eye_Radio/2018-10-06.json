Ninety a red eye\nWall Street journal editorial from yesterday\nBut never conservatives to Capitol fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now right and and uh you don't make a great point in the number conservatives are the left by the way that it doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump and and we have talked about how this is United the ... the Republican Party and the different factions\nAnd even the never Trump hers and it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party and a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid misfortune name from Republicans for six weeks founder a lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed and an orchestrated the role water for an accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive and disassemble ing button no action in his presidency comes close to matching the part of the viciousness of the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms ...\nI was a meeting sometimes profess to be puzzled that more than eight percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason I mean the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their ... methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man\nAs distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threaten their grip on power sure Republicans are well aware of Mr Trump's accepted and false woods but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit\nVoters know this is about the less will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that\nAnd for the American left\nThey're all deplorable none of them yeah I think that's a I think it's a great pizza and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nA ... here and it's more than just about that it is about the fact that they now understand how far the less we'll go what the left is about ... and that's it and and\nThis is not something you usually forget there's what another five weeks are less than five weeks now before the election\nAnd I think\nThis is not going to it's not just a motivating factor for the election I think it's a motivating factor for the Republicans in general I think it's a motivating factor for those in power [noise]\nUh not just to try and retain their power but beyond that should do something together as a party and and get to work on a number of agenda items [noise] we'll see if that happens\nOr this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out yeah\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats ... used you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their Laufer Perkins ... law firm Perkins Kuwait who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day unverified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that white before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley that really when you look at it they're the ones that started the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign literal got to the law firm they were the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right\nAnd I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI to\nSay well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and the attorneys meeting\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic national committee's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dog ca oven cooperated Ron allergens alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com it\nMeans the FBI had good reason to suspect the dog she ate was connected to the ... main law for them and and what's the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the ... court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declines in the votes of testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins Kuwait law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often state of this and I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah I've been to a couple of seasons\nThis this could be twenty four yeah I've been to a capital\nOf the even though you could do proper having more seasons and law and order\nA couple of seasons because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could included in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change because of change than to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then the reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusations they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump on verified information still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fault [noise] after ... after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy your campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the fight to court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they don't make the east treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now all the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as it tried to\nEven debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at ... news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together and the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long\nWhere it is active because they didn't feel active\nMueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I didn't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right the longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more investigations go on as you've seen you know with\nThe ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's quite a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a no cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we've seen it but the Democrats did with Diane Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes\nNow that we know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred and I and we know the process that yes they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this thing moving forward or if\nIf you look at this I mean this is where we got to have you done that in July we may not know Dr Ford's name because if it was part of the free oh two

private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that uh I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you\nTalk about how a background check has done for those that were in the

who had both parents were immigrants and so there will say that there was a a a special kind of background check\nOkay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual and your family

used to play hopscotch or in his underwear\nWhich we all know to be true I think we can all agree on that [laughter]\nAnd he didn't use real shock but the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim\nThe reason the FBI as part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training in order to substantiate claims when they do so on a criminal investigation\nThey for the most part get it right but they are the point being they have the resources muttering to get that done\nThat's why you do that that's it's part of the process but there could be a claim let's just say one that's not backed up by any witnesses from something that happened decades ago about a nominee\nAnd then if the media got hold of it than it would turn into something that may be didn't warrant that

from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nOkay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter] you know in other news on this from the hill dot com and it's just breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign and\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from Perkins ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dogs the aid\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the weapons always uncooperative [laughter] cooperating raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack\nThe presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and swords has declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about at the media contacts citing an ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nOn new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration and collusion with clearly part in some elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking his because what you have there you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you had them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon\nTest to find the tie and we worked ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC his lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured mourn right Internet your investigation going on and he likes the apparently that's what the source to say he said they talked to they talk to Perkins who was the lawyer but typically about the allegations on Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days of the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices that some Bloomberg now\nAll pets largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the records set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrel she said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market it's currently over supply he said\nUh the key insight sisters from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure\nFrom Trump now we talked about his 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the world cup we beat Saudi we need every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that states here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nPet some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading as mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a they don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations for all this\nOnce we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nBut I get I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia mhm gives me\nWere there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we wonder what your military were were there for you all the time ... ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member light bill pact member [laughter]\nVery good deal back then the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in weight\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrats courses nor the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one of the point of just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um whatever wealth starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look and we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] ... babies\nAre what the original chair of the you know terrible [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned and said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ... or\n... who's leading the columnist for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parks rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle life even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by boats walk in Mountain View other manufacturers of Mexico may no longer qualified for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to ship to the U.S production image simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers\nEspecially low income consumers in the United states and so we said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and I called the limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and it's set all along are we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if if you wind up basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the other things are hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then\nOnce it all worthwhile and the farmers saying just days ago that you know their their bail out that they got their government money they don't want they that they really didn't because that's not going to you know be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that sales would help\nEight six six Ninety right on the Detroit power train offers a fish and sea fruit innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Tomball", "day": "06"}
