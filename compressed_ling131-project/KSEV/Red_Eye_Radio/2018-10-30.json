Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about and twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the some of\nThe Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what\nThen why wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote\nThe daylights out of it yet I because it's one of the top issues than Americans\nCare of what because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the set of it by the American people is is shifting on health care in this uh this is where the central middle of the American people is right now\nThis is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you\nAre charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it what you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nTo Newt Gingrich showed him because he saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we got this by the way we got criticism ... we are criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare I stopped saying that we are we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they just they were what were they were doing was probably what\nThe mandate but the actual benefits state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the\nRight and so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately that should have been the president and and and this is why we have said that we know that people love the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done\nMore to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all ... so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we've criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just send me whatever and I'll sign right because the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it and he keeps fighting\nAnd individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it and he keeps fighting in a lot of people have been told that the last couple of weeks it was like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical\n... you've got to take the hardy shoes and one of the hardest teachers out there it's health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within as we'll have like taxes because he's a businessman but you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did a candidate was to what we do manage well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no knowledge in what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved this president\nEasily\nCould point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up\nAs a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government\nIs necessarily going to be able to curb what they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now the choking in hospitals it's choking employers\nAnd as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so you\nHad an empire and when he got out and in payments to insurance\nCompany at all and and and the the president pointed that out how's that that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't in his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care\nIs well within this will happen undo unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all\nRight well and then that case he's going to have started talking about yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done because if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore how\nLet's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really didn't ... that was a cry and then the president probably had to admit no will not we did get rid of all the bottom of care\nBut I mean but that's part by the way that's part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem we had with the right ... we said look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I just you know we didn't know and people would argue with us why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause of the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that are still in place the hospitals and employers\nAnd by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the costs yeah H ... n we consider to matter what six Ninety what I

president involved in or was involved in this business is connected to\nThere's there's ... there's got to be a lawsuit a white now pending lawsuits for basically all of those branches of his business I'm guessing there's some kind of legal action in our lights are on buddy going after him not not based on politics I'm just\nTalking about the every day back and forth of business at that level\n\nWell would be an interesting figure that when the president falling says okay I'm retiring\n...\nYou know when he says I'm retiring from well he's not going to but hypothetically that he's got to go from being he's he's got to go from being president right back into Vince is again oh yeah yeah you could have been right they're not going to be so weird it's like okay I'm going to retire and make some speeches right why did I get a shock because it's ... it's not going to be like\nArnold who went from making you know fairly cool movies you know and big movies box office movies to becoming governor and then making really not grading movies he's going to the president or go back to them you know building resorts like you did before\nBut it would be interesting let's say and just say I keep thinking when she's Seventy two now ... to me he seems younger yeah you know and so I was thinking in my mind was like well maybe one day the I don't know it's just a few years from now [laughter]\nHe's like well he's a Sudanese Ninety he says I'm I'm going to retire and just\nI Would love to see somebody like him even take out the presidency because that you have lawsuits all the time part were you know a ... and she was a president mhm yeah let's get it but just take the business law suits but I Would also like to see what it is\nWhen you talk about the any president's personal lawyers\nAnd how much they have to spend over the period of the presidency just on lawyer if he's All right just their personal lawyers non White House or do not white no personal except\n\nI'd love to see that number you know it's that's why ... and who went more when when when people to them but you guys ever run for office no no no doesn't [laughter] doesn't pay enough for the possible lawsuits that would be ...\nIf I Would I Would rather serves a volunteer a you know to a nonprofit organization which which I Do I but I I Would rather do things\nOther than terminals serving in a society apple survey but I don't I don't want to be a volunteer for presidential campaign because now he's being a volunteer oh no no presidential campaign will get you huge lawyer fees can ask George Papadopoulos yeah added Carter Page and these were I'm\nPaid yeah campaign people I Wonder what their lawyer FISA bed right\n\nAfter amazing I have a feeling Papadopoulos is going to write a book on this if it's true what he said in\nAnd yesterday you had to leave a little early to go to a conference in and we talked about this the Papadopoulos you know coming on or you know the the tweet saying by the way Congress knows who's a spy was in the campaign so do I can't can't say yet but he's also said that he made he may reverse his plea\nFrom what he learned in okay from what we are the question about are about the whole Michael Flynn thing now again we're talking about you know those those are separate charges\nBut\nAnd and this this whole thing if there is the the basis of a ... if the very basis of all of it was\nAbout the ah the spy on the campaign the uh the the\nIll gotten possibly Pfizer warrant and all of that if everything stem\nFrom that ... of what we're looking at with Papadopoulos\nA Michael Flynn if the if the if the fact of the matter is is that they were on to Michael Flynn because of of that we don't know we have no idea but if that were the case which means that would be no basis\nFor those investigators to be talking to Michael Flynn which means they shouldn't have been there and the charges would be dropped now we we have no idea because he's his hearing sentencing hearing is coming up here\nAnd I'm In a matter of weeks now what five or six weeks away\nWell but the question is why was delayed by special prosecutor why did why did Mohler agree to lay not one but multiple times the sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn then you add to it Papadopoulos and then add to it\nThat the White House handed to the inspector general's office at the department of justice\nAll of that from the Pfizer warrant\nA situation and turned it over to here's our would knowing and and we had been pointing this nobody's been asking this question\n... outside of that I Know of why would you send it to the inspector general because you believe something internally was or wasn't some kind of wrongdoing at at the department of justice\nHow in here and the way to find that out is through a proper I'd try investigate noble\nWhat I'm what I'm thinking of is Papadopoulos the reason he said that\nAnd and he said first off that you know I I I may\nTake away that guilty plea for line ... ... if you live your life will possibly get you out of that how could it and he said not necessary to get it reverse but just to bring forth what happened and I started thinking okay and then he started talking about the spy the only thing I could think of is\nThe spy with somebody who actually was not an operative for the Democrats but somebody from law enforcement who was put there because it all relates to the Carter page warrant right which was illegally gotten across the board\nFor page warrant right which was\nIllegally got ... across the board and not only we could have possibly affect the Michael Flynn case because if\nThe warrant was illegally gotten than anything that comes from it mhm is tainted every in every single ... ... everything and that's what I'm thinking so they got the warrant part of the war was once they justify the warranted law enforcement push right somebody in law enforcement that\nKind of in a ... or an informant that were maybe not an FBI person but an informant that the FBI put in there\nYou know that just to to look at Papadopoulos and it was all based on the information that they had gotten from the dog she a and the war and everything your dinner connected with the\nFight the war\nAnd so everything around it as tainted and that's what he feels can possibly get him off on that\nOr at least expos what was going on there where the prosecution eventually just says okay the the you know that you're guilty plea is is way or whatever\nBecause it looks so bad for the FBI and the department of justice look something's going on here when when the president said well a lot of the top secret in our allies would rather are not release it so I'm going to give it to the inspector general to review you and I both said it doesn't make\nAny sense that doesn't make any sense at all because you're not looking you that's not what you do you're not talking about the national security advisor you're not talking about the uh the the uh the secretary state\nYou're talking about the I. G. of the department of justice and the entire role the entire reason that the IGA exists is to investigate wrong to wrongdoing in side the department of justice and corruption yes\nAnd the only thing we can think of as they believe\nThat after they declassified it and those emails back and forth in text messages\nBetween the FBI and the department of justice what they found was the corruption that they believe will take down the entire case I Can't think of anything else what else could it possibly be the inspector general does not care\nHe does not review top secret material to find out whether it should be released or not he only looks for corruption yep\n\nThat's and knowing that the idea would have access to anything and everything that he wanted to access inside the department of justice you actually have a better investigative tools and Congress just\nEight six six Ninety right out\nIts engine report is brought to you by Detroit ...
