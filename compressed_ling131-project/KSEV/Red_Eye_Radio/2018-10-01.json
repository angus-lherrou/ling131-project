[noise]\nUm she didn't come off as being true boy I'm for one thing [noise]\nI myself and this was a fear of you know be proof for you and your garage talk who you talk about it but I'm taking she was

[noise] it's just that she does too much work and when she was she used to shoot a hundred per se but it was traveling All right there I mean\nWell I I Will tell you that I mean when when they said that she was credible as I said the reason she is incredible because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony\nThat's why when anybody and I would love to have it in a never happened but I Would love to interview one of the Democrats who say she was credible how forget about the fact that her own witnesses she was ... there is no forensic evidence and no witnesses even the ones that she names and ... story\nBut the fact is what she says her self if you just came in you say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible mhm\nYeah I mean that's the that's what ... was a place here\nWhether or not she was to be bullied because remember what they were calling for first she needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be her well then she was heard well that's not enough [noise] wait a minute what if you believe her testimony to be credible\nThen that is\nEnough for her speaking in front of the

question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as I as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to back or off when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement it's a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know what she did it by any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give\nGive contradicting testimony that you gave not credible right the ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody is that the Democrats that specific question but again it just say for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer just moves on\nIt's like okay give me an answer you want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news\nIs the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's that important that there's an expectation yep\n[laughter] remember who now who who was at who at the bottom of the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in those ... won't level isn't\nOh no yeah yeah yeah well there's a separate incident okay a one where you had a local reporter here ah from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of ...\nThat that if you ask the question didn't make sense to be a follow up question by that that there's actually an end this was something that has to stop\nThis ... this kind of bizarre old world we're fact\nThat we have politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down the right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course it's not permitted because there was some kind of bizarre world were back\nThen a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer a question on an issue but it's the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna gutless go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them while you're yelling at all of them and you know that but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe ... the person especially a public servant was being interviewed does not dictate the questions I\nDon't know I Know\nAnd what will they do when they don't ask the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question some well and that's just\nThey need to it it's very clear to us but it's just said we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking all my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the\nEasy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer\nAs soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou get\nYour your your or\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did\nLike this you can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylights out of ... this is why people hate it no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they run they knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks\nIn a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nWon't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise]\nAnd that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're a U.S senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House\nWhen you go on a show you know while you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this and so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that which is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore I think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no let's face it the other way [laughter] meet the press that was crushed the me we're going to do a handshake\nThat's the way it's going to be we're just going to go out there and pat each other on the back\nUnless you're a Republican and this week this week this ... where there\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\n\nI might as well be covering that answer every question here mom [laughter] think late did your mom

constituents are seriously in the case of Jeff Flake\nHe didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer I don't know I don't know who ... yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an oil [laughter] ah\nBecause of various or not or at very observant yeah yes and it's

and I just looking at some of the video from uh Indonesia absolutely horrified and from the building where you can see and then there's a wrote in front of them near the beach and\nCars are going up and down and you can see in the distance you can see the new nominee weighed coming at them yeah the video being taken by a man who was\nWarning people on the ground to get up there they're on top of the building a looks to be like a rooftop parking lot or there's some vehicles are surrounding these people that are that are up there and that Saddam he comes and it was roughly ten feet a ten foot wave\nThat comes through and why these houses moves them like they're nothing uh so far the update this morning eight hundred and forty four dead\nSome of those dead many of those dead being buried in mass graves [noise] there are in Indonesia after this earthquake happened on friday and then the and then of course after the earthquake the ah Saddam a hit and\nA Paolo city is a really kind of the center point uh for for much of this activity and you're seeing a ton of this\nAgain these ... this footage that's coming out there than most of it from citizens there and people that that were there on the ground but a while and then you look at the pictures that came out on Saturday and Sunday uh the aftermath and it it it it just looks horrific\nYeah just horrifying watch that video because the guy screaming for the kids that are running up and that got off the road and got up there but it just it the roads you people going down the road back you know just driving down it you know in about ten seconds is going to be wiped out and it was yeah a terrifying just to see for under attracts here's your forecast\nWhat can I pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today\nWill continue to see the chance of right along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over the Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of a mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota\nSo if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year\nThat snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit is going to be in the form of rain clear today in the northeast and Midwest there's a lecture national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight to ... Ninety what I [noise]\nAll that now all that water under the bridge those lawyers to fight them the more investigation and it's fair misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face our investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly happens hundreds upon hundreds of times every year\nAnd there's this year it to me it doesn't have a rather than a hundred times where it where it's just that or the sense that if they live issues that are The Simpsons either iron and I've only had a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go [noise]\nWanna move away from that because that doesn't look good for the narrative arc yeah well no because those those are huge points that he made yeah I mean those are those are huge points first about the lawyers we ate at that question\nWe had at that we'd ask that question early on when she made it seem like Ford made it seem like I never knew that the committee which to talk to me will the committee talk to the lawyers and that's when we get asked that question we took that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her\n\nAnd they need to an end as he said Ford wars will face a Washington D. C. bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interview or well why wouldn't say\nRight\nI mean who's working for your pro bono are you you're not working in the best interest of your client if you're not giving them the options that it's a charge that caught and it's making there which is huge because that shows why that's why wouldn't you were lawyers be working for the best interest of you\nBecause they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much you're paying them as a client I'm not paying them oh so are they actually working for you and that's where you you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation\nThat you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you asked a question why didn't they inform her and she didn't know\nWhy did and will those questions they asked by the U.S me uh well I mean you would\nYou you're looking to through the FBI looking the vetting process all over again right\nBecause it is a serious allegation\nIs just as much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the truth is not necessarily to find out which one is line because one of them is lying\n\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nAnd the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point we'll find signed deter bad since ... one wouldn't know she didn't and as we cut all along if you listen to the show we said look there is a process\nAnd I'm Glad that Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and and they said they do this hundreds of times you can and Dickerson he doesn't know who will not that sensitive because no justice sensitive another riches but things that are highly secretive but we don't want people to know about\nBecause we are doing you know in in different investigations and so this has actually done where she should have\nWhen she got the letter G the protocol is you're building rationally you're the ranking minority member\nYou go to ... you talked about it and you say okay one group well probably what would you would have said was look we can lead to contact her back\nAnd tell her we can do an FBI investigation if she wishes to the to go forward we can do an FBI investigation\nAnd we can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually interview people on this and keep your name out of it you know and then we get to a certain point\nWe might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation absolutely we can didn't find son tell her that\n\nAre Feinstein's goal was to hold that as long as possible to bring it at the last possible second ...\nKnowing that they're only play here was political in nature not actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation but the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation\nHad they wanted the investigation Feinstein would've made that happen right away\nWhich tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story number one because if they if they felt it was fully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation than Feinstein would've acted July thirtieth\nAnd you know something I I I agree with the Democrats they they did shouldn't do an expanded they should do and expanded a you know a background check and they should uh talk to forward and say ... or ... your lawyers went through a by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah\nSo there's anybody in pain you besides her let's let's let's expand that [noise] I Wonder if the Democrats really which should be expanded huh\nI'm doubting it\nOkay we're done it's a week okay we're going to vote no anyway so it's\n[laughter] well because what they need is a new unobtainable\nCoal\nSo in this case a ... like you said Romero's she needs to be her\nI I Believe that will be the next thing she needs to tell her story they're gonna realize this one's going nowhere so you need to go to the next allegation that's not cooperated and hear from her and you just go\nNeed to go to the next allegation that not cooperated and hear from her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend that now the balls and procedure like the balls and McConnell score\nYes but the vote is not know where the votes fall is not\nCan you stand to lose a Jeff Flake yes if you have man I Can't who's still on the fence Donnelly gives a no doubt that you mentioned you can lose if you've got mansion you can lose if you've got high camp and if you got to call him and if you've got\nA faster than you do when you're on a test or he said no so if if that goes forward\nHow many I guess the question is how many can you afford it so you can you can lose if you've got if mansions on you can lose like in one more\n\nBecause you've got fifty one mhm and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to still have fifty and have the vice president break developed right\nThat if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all\nBut they've got to have you know they would have done this over the weekend I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling that if the FBI investigation comes in and you know even if it talks were mirrors and said look nobody can cooperate her story either\nA ... on this in fact we sort of get the same thing with the the witness was there a I think at that point they will have the vote and then we want to hear about this again or does it die forever it probably dodge forever\nSomebody said they'll keep bringing it up now they won't they [noise]\nWell if you're ever get nowhere rent produce anything for it yet it it has it won't affect his decisions they can't write so they you know if it once you see them Supreme Court well though impeach well they could impeach but you still need\nTwo thirds of the Senate ... you're never going to get two thirds of the Senate with peach peach a Supreme Court judge on ... all you would need you know and and so you could impeach not removed from the Supreme Court but that's wasting time and energy for the Democrats would know they're never going to get\nA you know to the the the sixty two on the on the lack of evidence that you have an any of these cases right now right because you're not going to learn anything new about this about the alleged events and we're likely to learn nothing new about the alleged events from the FBI background check eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional
