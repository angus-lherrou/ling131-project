the executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was really actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nThe request was torn investigation into the uh current credible allegations against justice Kavanaugh read the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the\nSummary states at the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential firsthand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the ... lawyers that well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigators poke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against capping off\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in the eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA

look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change\nThat gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all along delayed delayed July with the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the let's got the the greater or I guess the stronger a foot hold got\nBy the president and of course the nominee himself this was a tactic by the left to delayed there's nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can uh appeal\nTo either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even further and that's over it is over\nI don't know what the vote looked like on Saturday Night

raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just drop the allegation yeah and and there's one slightly dirty words later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about what we've been through this already know what kind of the McCarthy\nMerv you're not a comment right exactly\nThat's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about yeah now what they endorse exactly four on detractors are forecast\nAn unusually precooked and weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies rain snow into the great

partisanship [laughter] the opposite [noise]\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would be having the opposite way and so it is partisanship\n[noise] and I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great yeah\nI I and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know if\nIt's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on so late Saturday or\nSunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote\nI mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay up as long as you can hold an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but as president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of its employees\nWell you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who cares you being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself met you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used on a you know against you\nAre and I thought there's which you know really when he said he said so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling your comment if you're on the temperament for the job so you're up you're blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have\nBeen having this discussion a\nBack and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know antifa anti cause we call it this supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is our actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here\nWhat you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you'd see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know of Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe the accused her\nThat the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty\nThat is the mindset of a fashion\nThat is that's not the mind set of somebody who believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America in the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with pacific's not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fashion no wonder is exact words in what is the actually which to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they moved on and this is a\nVery very important thing for people to understand that I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hated Trump where it stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to capping off and all the sudden the realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say well this is somebody who really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you\nSee the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realize\nOh no if it can hit him then it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindsets they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and say and sometimes I wake up in a society and it's too late\nIt's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back are you now have you know creating this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only go so far because people are good will buy into it at times\nYes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fashion and the fastest in this case is not the Republicans eat is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name and factors condemn down to those condense from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of business\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours\nThat somebody which is ...\nFascist you you don't create the ours that somebody which is you to create we will destroy your business you wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will ... you out\nYou think like us you behave like God's you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and uniting realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become an it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah it's in the Senate Judiciary committee it's the main stream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party and you have\nA vaccine waters who doesn't get any great from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and\nGet in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right\nBecause the average American will put up or for a while until all the sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it\nSeems that they have but my hope is that the American people have had enough and that more people will start rejecting\nThe the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the main stream of the Democratic party yeah as we're always say tell us where we're wrong\nYou can't eight six six Ninety red eye\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral
