he only wants to be one\nThe president of Americans for tax reform and you can reach them at eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions and we'll we use that in a what I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cuts passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful for ... uh one of things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy percent\nOf the ballots highs Ninety percent during World War two a Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it from seven eight to twenty eight [noise]\nUnfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards south over forty percent and uh so at the individual level began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the world or the rest of the world started experimenting with lower\nBusiness taxes or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economically a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business taxes nine percent we're at thirty five we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how come we can't compete with China and Germany and stuff like that in Ireland are lose business taxes twelve and a half percent\nA week what thirty thirty five plus an average of four percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine on average and uh the Republicans truck that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax front than most of the country's law\nYeah European countries about twenty five but ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat us when they sent me to say I have a million dollars I don't think there's like invested ... million dollars what do I put shit I invested I hate those thirty five percent of everything I like\nIf I put it in Germany they only take tribal idled surely are and we shifted that down and we have seen a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment [noise] out of Europe and the United states uh for starters that was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was earnings by American companies\nShapes and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform that\nPunished you if you brought laid back that states could leftover shapes as\nMaybe three trillion dollars to the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring them back and if you don't pick up I guess I had a show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy\nAnd said you know what we're not doing that anymore if you earn money United States we tax yet but if your money in ... the French people take some ... going to bring up the holy America good no taxes no power no penalty for bringing like back that how 'bout that ad that\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars five let him come back the last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars of earnings overseas they brought Ninety billion right back\nAnd said you know what because it's no longer have allies to move buddy from London to New York or tax us um\nWe may not bring it all back now it's all coming back\nBut right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas\nUh whereas before it did show that money might as well are ready to be back but we've seen a half to try and come back I mean it might and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and Brazilians\nMaking decisions are selling their money to the United states rather oversees this really irritating your pets because we're much more competitive than we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why may seem so obvious all these things seems to me have a couple of more questions are going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take our in our national forecast for um detracts\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lakes region today and that will provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news various showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nWe're going to get about another inch of rain today and then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the we had for the region and we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest four corners region southern states are predicted to have a wetter than average winter\nThere to look at your national forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout\nAnd here's your chance to any questions or comments you have on taxes Grover Norquist land so them for\nYou to tax reform Marcus literally radio\nNo let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist think\nAppreciate it I'll tell you what you get to work right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's ... percent a cross the border\nIt don't matter whether you're a Warren\nBuffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds seven percent limit every deep dark shoot that there is\nAs far as a a tech fuel limiting all federal tax is whether it's in the field tax that we pay or whether it's Social Security income tax you name it or if it's a federal tax it no longer exists\nYou will limit the sixteenth demand and that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that\nMeans you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for it be for it to be come a\nBallot or the election of on every two\nYears that's one third grader do and it requires a super majority of all registered voters\nIn order for the taxes to be ratings and I think you know and as you just mentioned uh it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me once people realize how much they're paying out in taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe\nHow much I was happy to play out taxes\nInteresting Grover what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions\nUh in California and Nevada or\nIf you if the government wants to raise taxes steak but wants to raise taxes it's a two thirds voted Lynch such because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds or to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the attacks in spenders down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support\nA to an AK ... and his ... his flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically changed our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax the consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have they value added tax which is a sales tax at every\nStep of production for if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is American countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nA so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who trucks goods into town pays at\nA twenty percent on his value out of the way to get ... percent tax\nBut he had a little ... amounts and there's no one place where you can avoid ah the difference between the United States Europe is Europe and\nHas a sales tax of a national sales tax a value added tax which gets every level of a production or it's why they have higher taxes than we do that stupid income taxes and high income taxes you can only get so much money out of an income tax\nPeople will quit working out work around that\nHide money um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have a bat and they do we don't have a sales tax they do tend to say no no we want to sweat rather the income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nStaff but it's kind of what they promised their hands on the Japanese and the Asians and and the Africans when they put that send overseas or it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for granted income tax down towards zero I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you've got the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ...\nHow would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else who's writing the check\nEverything you buy from your house cheer car cheer\nCheer for dear close would cost more and that and the taxes would be hidden in that so um I think going to a single rate tax income tax ah and we do sing spending is the mood to go to know if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax just got it's got to be ... plot or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its present size before you could\nCome back and you really have kept protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this hey you know give me this donation someone in ... they don't want to think solved eventually right they reduce their camps\nAnd ... they don't want to things solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions as soon as we thought on my part\nHaving taxes that I'm a complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people like that where you're paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and counts maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more well not commissioner him how do you know what do you know if the Democrats ... take the house when you think about what's going to have a situation [noise]\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will do push ups for tax increases that light at least a trillion dollars in higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes a trade and a half they want to raise them I Try and for what we were so that's ... trillion dollars in taxes\nPer decade that they want to increase taxes deli pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want the military to get pay will only do that ... only passed a budget\nOr the soldiers and airmen Tim and buy it and they ... they ... they will spend two years trying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em but Democrats\nOn the tax issue like teenage boys are the prime day they keep asking for the same thing in different ways that just again and again and again they keep coming back I Want one thing they want higher taxes are and they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green and taxes it will save the planet that will be\nThe taxes that only pay the other people a day while we pack against the same tax increase on Desmond ways\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up anything is going to talk\nAbout it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of breath proposed a tax for it from a Norquist president Americans for tax reform that people get in touch with him\nAt our website it's H. E. R. dot org ah and we have a list to follow the companies that have ways to pay raise benefits um because of the tax cuts kind of a chair that dark and um I I I treated at corporate our question\nWell terrific thanks for giving us so much time and I support what you're doing and thanks for joining us on red eye radio\nWonderful thank you for having me\nAbsolutely and we'll take the rest of your calls eight six six Ninety red eye six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark guys for filling in on red our radio\nIts engine report is brought to you by\nDetroit ...
