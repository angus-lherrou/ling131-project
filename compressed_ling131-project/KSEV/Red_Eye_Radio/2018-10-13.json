possibly a super slander a stock report or\nOther nutty whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue their own this guy um but I think that if judge we're the super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yep he could not under the same rules capping off now for anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nWhen I say brought him I said it would slow them down and we give them food for food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically\nNot pursue this any further um maybe there's something there may be there the they've already heard from judge at or and or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nI'm a would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the leak and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the lead to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nFor Ford as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case in ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leads in the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think part of that and you haven't any case that way that was him yes yeah and then he came to eliminate because they're ... they're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right right\nRight or the only possibility of backlash I'm figures you wouldn't want to put as good buddy ...\nThey're already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there is doing this in spite of the news was invited to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nOr you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claim um and really the only one that that survived at all was Dr ... claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so\nThat's why I Am and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yes she was in trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ad in any case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor worth right I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right ah but with the other case to me that's clear you know what I mean it\nGoing going after capital with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nAnd then you've got to make your case it said where's the probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I'd like to just to ... percent only\nWell I'm In a while because we're the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this\nWhat role did he play in pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and and filing suit in the New Yorker sworn statement the New Yorker\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing it that and you would have a case at least to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens and\nCouldn't find first hand knowledge and made the can escape bothered with the responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that are forced to have an ... a ... and of course the New Yorkers printing of [noise]\nLocate well knows how to yo yo my point is we go point by point why what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a would share this fire at a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe that in their ... their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nNot one that ... that line says that's followed everybody to that was the Republicans' fault no\nI don't buy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing\nAny of these now with I don't I don't want it and get them but what did this behavior\nGet them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would a prosecutor\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's\nThe uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... Nevada is responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble that still might not go to the level\nOf perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating she's lying about it so uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of when you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah or any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate it so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was that Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions zero in the upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they shouldn't be winning\nA in a first term president and the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment it's criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nSo if you're angry that justices and all we done all I can say that from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged with because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want to charge right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth than we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\n... bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure taught me laugh when he said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colonies gives me you're willing to lie to ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally\nIt killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you can read the law\nAnd and everybody would agree with that what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried come lately over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we got a couple of allies or don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make a ... my ... we're going to go to Michael Horowitz from my\nDaughter went to my colleagues Michele out of it I don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other's says on the air when we went dead mhm is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to oh wait a minute\nInspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties fight oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption and so we don't know what's going to happen there but get a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing\nThat's on that and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it\nThe whole Russian scandal thing we said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent\nThe process the American people can decide because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they\nReally really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they\nReally really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who

[noise]\nAnd some of those purple states are over the next few weeks to remind people\nThat kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program need to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left his doing it'd be factual\nYou don't have to be there you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing your demonstrated\nAs one caller said just plug just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that over and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it has to this country\nOr for about the last so\nI'm going to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying\nThat it's never been easier to defend the conservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun the\n... or a negative ad campaign with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio I'm your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself\nYou don't have to add on\nTo anything from what we have seen the last two weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untrue right all you have to do is pointing out the truth I'm aware now and this is very very important\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party it now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know but the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God\nWhat in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of civility for they don't ... they don't care about it you know taking ... taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed for his life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to ... to destroy\nA camera on life plan on both sides you said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lively destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity\nWe just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play fair\nAnd I do think\nThat there is something here that it's even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat ... which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that move in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of okay we'll ... we'll Gorsuch uncovered I'll do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive in I think was going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these are reasonable people\nRight and I think you look at it got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America\nThe left may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them and they're they're jumping on and in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims\nThe fact of the matter is that's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do exactly what was done in the case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seventh background check and\nThat Grassley gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her\nCase you know something you just part of a great point there 'cause I when when I was getting my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing yes\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee are using the same argument yes they\nAre they're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what was the tactic being considered\nThe first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Capitol ... it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents thing by the way we're that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing as Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a rosy weight or anything else that wasn't I mean that was for Republicans with sort of my are are taken\nYou know what do you think if the government can the government force you to buy\nYou know what do you think if the government you can the government force you to buy vegetables\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left the mainstream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and certainly get praise there\nBut the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or and and her words and the others on that committee and their behavior\nAll of that\nCarries over into the election elsewhere it's not about her owner I can see that and get reelected in Hawaii Kamala Harris and say whatever she wants to and get reelected in California\nBut how did you damage anybody else that's right now on the brink of losing their election you dead and we'll find out how far that went about four weeks from tomorrow\nEight
