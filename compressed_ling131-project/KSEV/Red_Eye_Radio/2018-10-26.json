whole reason that this investigation was opened up would certainly not built on a solid foundation meadows told reporters he edited some\nJustice Department an FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether proper protocol was followed and I'm certainly willing to encourage that\nThe Republicans and Democrats are painted

said\nWell what are you looking for where do you end up [noise] Jamieson volunteer fire company no money in front of thousands are really so we're sorry even if it's the talk of ways it's not an urban area [noise]\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well important to monitor the truth expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector\nNot that we don't support an increase in defense spending\nNo we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how would apply how the economy is doing so without the increase in government spending or you would have had a\nA ... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration\nThe point is how critical it is because you see the increase in the the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending right since April of ... twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nRoughly year and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who use to agree with us\nBut now disagree with us on the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we said it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increase costs in good in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about insects simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services\nWhen we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what what he believes he has done to the car industry\nWhich will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on terrorists the president did all over the place\nAnd when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do of any idea what you're talking about well and\nAs we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then it's actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of his growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing where the gross is in the private sector\nOr wherever the lack of growth\nIs in the pie in the end of that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right is that why is that why you do it but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same it's in the private sector\nBecause the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something\nThat makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use that and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increase in productivity along that private sector line that really boost [noise]\nReally is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth thinking it's our society thinking the smartphone\nYeah you know why it was so that that is that that great demand um because of that because it's\nCreate that efficiency and society and in and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier or to create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nWell defense spending you will build the initial product [noise] but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something you're using debt down the road where yes\n... but you're creating something you're using debt down the road it's where you get the sort of fun to write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector new improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity of other businesses down the line\nStay there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy yeah\nAnd that I mean difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general and if you roll right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are due\nAnd that's and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the terrorists and the cost of home building now and the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know and and told the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talked about what what the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars\nBoth been targeted by terrorists ... we haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road for and the big terrorists haven't even it yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to\nEconomics and I have no idea where has has the ... Congress talked about and uh about what they're going to do with the new NAFTA there'd been I don't know I well zero talk on\nWhat happens if you are because they want to get this done\nSoon and what happens when the house if the house goes to the Democrats\nYou know can they get this thing done by the end of December and they get this through the end it because we're talking about what to the Republicans have they feel about it right we're not we're not too sure yeah even forget about him for an hour we talk about the the house turning blue\nWe have to talk about and that they the Republicans right now and given or I assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nAnd so you have to ask what are the plants because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\n\nAnd serials as in in that you're you're seeing some of the earnings report coming out from major companies\nUm a number of them are that that was\nA certain ... or are they came out the

a sending a political message or and and you know or a broader message I guess\nAnd when you start looking at the terminology that the authorities are using\nWhat the I guess I look for first in some kind of public warning\nIf you're talking about very sensitive package and a number of packages now that have been all over the country are not just in one city not just in one location but there have been a number of them and various locations\nThan you would think that the threat is still active knowing that it's happened now for a period of date a repeatedly\nAnd you would warn the public as to what to look for and we haven't seen that that huge warning in terms of these packages being a ultra sensitive and possibly going off simply have handled\nSo on top of that there's not much clarity or I get information that at all really if you think about the nature of these devices other than what we've heard from the authorities being possibly dangerous potentially dangerous\nIf we learned the identity often you go to their social media page or something like those and you see a history of maybe comments that were made and you can see their political affiliation but if we learn that motivation I don't know what changes about the election right now because you look at the bigger things right um\nThe the I think the capital thing the the the caravan situation or immigration in general and and what's going on\nAnd where conservatives are I think with with ah with all of the above this was not the group that goes out and protest is not the grass roots people are screaming get out and vote get out and vote get out and vote\nIn is the silent type that has made up their mind they were outraged what happened during the Kavanaugh process\nAnd they will act on it that that concern that passion doesn't go away because you understand what's at risk here if we're to disrupt the process as was attempted during the capital or a ... confirmation process\nThen you have

things we talked about is\nYou know states around the country wanting to legalize marijuana and all that for recreational purposes I was just telling you during the break looking reading the story here that the city of the law I'm living in now is putting a petition in order to be able to sell hard liquor\nYeah we can't so hard liquor in our city\nAnd trying to make it so we can actually open up bars mhm 'cause he got a private club instead of private clubs right because uh you know they they want they want more businesses not ... not making my city are you know competitive with surrounding cities you know like Arlington, Texas and when he was\nYou know a huge city that can get there can draw revenue when you're attached to them in a smaller city so I just find it interesting Boulder other municipalities around the country talking about marijuana we haven't even got to alcohol yet where I live yeah I don't even have a petition that might so did you get the hard liquor\nNot yet right directly so yeah we just got beer and wine to a couple of years to say I think we got it within probably the last twelve Thirteen year yeah\nSo uh it's just a I mean I didn't know my city my city is actually in four different county yeah I didn't know the government to I didn't know there are four and so there's different rules all over the place you know I Wonder I guess we might that he

high fifty three New York partly sunny today and fifty two with rain expected tomorrow\nYour national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John H ... six Ninety run I coming up our audio part of the week [noise] [noise]\nIn part because of the capital thing and her vote in the capital thing and we said that you don't have to be a you know someone else\nA who's on the committee you don't have to be from our heritage or anyone else who did something you know that you consider to be crazy or your voters potentially consider to be crazy in order to feel the effects of it\nIf you vote no then you're going to essentially condone that kind of behavior and I think that's what she in part is facing right now in her state and that is your vote was everything that they needed some of those independents needed\nA to make their decision and could well does decide their vote on election day if it hasn't already an early voting\nYou will have because I'm sure they'll be in some of the weekend shows you'll see some analysis of this as they do the analysis of a different commercials\nBut I looked at that says more than just affective Republican advertising or Republican rhetoric I Do believe 'cause I'm trying to think of any ad where I've heard the Republicans say the crazy Democrats ... ...\nAh I I don't know a ... a ... ...\nI don't know I don't know if it's if Trump is used data in a in a rally or not but the fact is that you this is in these independents that you're trying to convince in fact I was just thinking\nDuring the bottom of the hour break after our letter segment I was thinking to myself 'cause we were talking about people that go out and vote\nThat I went out and voted the other day early voting hours go out and vote it's just a habit I always vote I voted before it was ever a talk show host you always went out and voted dad made sure when you got to be Eighteen he's brought up a newspaper everybody goes and vote she live in this house\nThere were two rules you didn't tell you who to vote for he'd give you his ideas of who he thinks you should vote for but you had to vote no choice you live in his house you voted\nAnd when you were sixteen you got your drivers permit to get your license you did not wait those are the two things you couldn't say wow I really don't you know couldn't be you know saying oh we don't doubt that wasn't happening in my family maybe my sisters but not my brother and I we wanted our licenses ASAP and so we were happy for that role\nAt Eighteen it was like a ... but we had we had to vote so\nThat was built inside of me I really don't understand the mentality which is why when we talk so much about independence this week we've got into arguments when people say well don't people don't react that way well you don't know and I don't know what we're saying is it's a possibility\nAnd when we say it's a possibility I've been getting the reaction back you know it's an absolute that nobody would react that way well you don't know that ... and that's why all these advertisements are going on because of the politicians don't know that\nAnd so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only\nI'm undecided I don't know if I'm going to vote yet I might vote on might not vote but I'm undecided and all this massive advertising that is hounded my way I don't know what gets that person off there but as an undecided independent to go out and vote if they're still undecided at this point\nBecause think about it anybody listening right now\nIs it very hard to imagine yourself as an independent not sure where you're going to vote in this election\nRight [noise] yeah this late in the process I don't know this this seems like one of those appeals especially using the words crazy Democrat it it it reeks of that almost desperate to peel or Hail Mary and it it could be\nToo little too late but you do it anyway because you believe that there's no risk in using oh why\nIs this what she decided to use them that desperate attempt because it's more than just Republican that that's a I guess my point it's more than just Republicans Colleen Democrats crazy that sticking\nIt the fact that even if they don't hear Republicans saying those crazy Democrats\nThe appearance of Democrats in the media is giving them this opinion for a Democrat to in a political ad for the Senate of the United states\nCall her own party and I know people will say well she can hold it it was the actor no that's her doing it that's her ad she uprooted she approves it led ripped she was saying they were crazy through that actor\nFor a senator and in cutting senator to say that\nMeans that ... that is a worry right now right with Democrats not just in the mid term because it's not going away anytime soon find even if they get the house and they still don't have the power\nI'm not sure that I Would even here I guess it depends on if the race were different when Joe mansion if his race were different in terms of the numbers that were neck and neck if he would use that I don't know that he would use that what we've heard the the idea of before\nYou know over in the house side to him right\nYou know trying to challenge a Nancy Pelosi\nAh you know back in the day but the fact that what were they saying the identity politics\nBut if it's that that's gone from that is that it's not about you know trying to ... it's interesting because identity politics almost sounds like an old phrase right [laughter]\nFull on crazed that's that's right and he's Seventeen\nBecause you have to go straight to what people are saying and how do you connect with people in their own language\nThat's the difference is is what the people are clearly telling the McCaskill campaign and the feedback their internal are seeing that praise used repeatedly\nAnd that's why it was used in the ad\nThat's why it was our audio cut of the the week and I I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill\nYou don't cut of the week and I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill yesterday called for civility in the debate we need civility civility\nWhat do you mean you're calling your own party crazy [laughter] how much do you really need it if we look we can understand we understand in politics you call in the opposition party crazy drier calling your own party crazy\nWow\nJust they're crazy rate the limit [laughter] and and she really is who you're talking about being in the middle or see the middle of a rock and a hard place that's where she's in the middle because\nYou've ... she had to vote on the Capitol thank right mhm I mean that action is there and it's lasting it's reaching enough at least and will be out through the election to make an impact and the behavior they're\n... remember they weren't referring to crazy Democrats the protestors on the street no no this was the party they were talking about the party and we pointed that out\nDuring the Kavanaugh confirmation process you're not talking about fringe of protestors on the street you're talking about people that were sitting on the committee these are these are the leaders of the party\nThat you're in and we were talking in reference to due process and present from the innocence this wasn't the radical protestors out there screaming you must always believed the woman\nThis was coming from the mainstream of the Democrats and as we said most people look at that and we gave some of the credit to all the lawyer shows that have been on over the last ... sixty years on television that Americans may not know the constitution up and down but they do know the presumption of innocence\nAnd and they do know the whole concept of due process because everybody has watch law and order or one of the other many thousands\nOf of a different TV episodes dealing with what goes on in court\nOr in this country and they looked at that and they went\nThis is crazy Geraldo white men need to shut down\n... you look at that and you say that's crazy mhm and it stuck mhm and so Claire McCaskill was force in desperation to say I know this is the reality of what people now believe my party is I'm not a part of it please vote for me\nEight six six Ninety right outside the Detroit power train offers a fish
