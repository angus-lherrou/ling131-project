was all about everything and you all for your story you're wondering what are all across\nAmerica eight six six Ninety red ideas are currently and I'm Jerry McNamara thanks so much for being here this morning [noise]\nWell we're talking about the political divide them as a country but we got some great color so far we really appreciate thanks to all of a couple of other stores you want to make sure we covered in the back of your calls in comments\nOn the political divide in America I just chuckled over this one on um MSNBC on on Saturday joy read\nAnd the panel were in a discussion on voters to pressure you know they've got the very tight race thinks the Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of ah of Georgia and\nThey're trying to make a big deal he's for voter suppression voter suppression are talking about the fact that uh there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong and so that for every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people lots of got that wrong except for seven years\nEvery two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you\nHave to purchase it and they're like and voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voters to pressure the law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rules after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't felt so so Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it\n[laughter]\nWe've passed that we didn't really me that he means that they make [laughter] we're Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls that you don't vote every seven yeah\nBut he's actually doing it and you just have a potluck in so that's bad he suppressing the vote out by the way if you want the president issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is what do you think about it how but ... that it\n\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it if ... is raising a ton of money so and and then oh cashier Cortez\nShe did it with very little money\nSo they're not there one more example\nOf them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and well we need to change that well that works against us\n\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to there's a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North in North Texas voter fraud rain\nFor women who are accused of targeting elderly voters were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud and arrested following an investigation by the Texas attorney general\nBefore women who are accused of targeting elderly voters in twenty sixteen\nWere indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud the defendants were members\nDominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people that voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nYou know we have to point out and I don't know if this was a part of it or if this would be in and the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nThat but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the damn oh I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know\nThat in the Senate and in the house that hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen\nYeah bowed out stage but now he's beautiful\nDead yes right now is useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president might lodging and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I bet if I was that it actually was able to me yeah that's and and it's\nNothing new but it it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him and she was in I'm not\nI mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott and are not going to support\nTed Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes forever but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate ... yeah\nNo there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share if that's left is considered that in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with or her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department under her\nThere's an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that in the end and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what we're comes together I guess on election day and and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\n... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six

I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that the civil war was for a new fight against other oppressed sort of a governmental systems there are no why we you know just a whole lot that we should have done that uh\nWe're we're on another different path now so I'm like no we are America this with America\nWhere we're at a state of vigil better than anybody or any of the country\nFor say ... I Believe it was better than everybody else in or in other countries\nYes and and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas\nIn in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the lead throws at conservatives in at the right that you ... you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what her how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with him about it and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything\nAbout race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be you must leave the white man over the black you know over over\nIf you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nIt all over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you

about employees who believed the Halloween it's offensive and celebrating the violation of their religious beliefs\nShould know how the the office Halloween party be renamed the last fall festival just like many Christmas parties are not rebranded as holiday parties and these are questions that can cause a jar managers to throw up their arms and avoid holidays altogether\nIf your company is going to bravely waged into the spooky legal minefield I'm a Halloween party the first place to start is a dress code otherwise just reading this from ladders dot com\nA brief Google Search of costumes leads to the conclusion that just about any a paperwork costume can be made inappropriate by simply add in adding excuse me sexy till the title\nOffice parties are do place\nSee to the title\nOffice parties are do place for sexy outfits political statements or costumes that might be offensive bait on a protected class such as race or gender\nSimply companies should have a dress code for Halloween for the same reasons most of the dress code for regular office attire without role some employees will not know where to draw the line\nOn good taste and offensive the tire it's
