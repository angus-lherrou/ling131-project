California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on radio walk into the show\nYou guys great show as usual things like that I had a\n... and I don't know if that's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly a super slander or your stock report or\nOther ... whatever his name is uh uh I think there are some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts agree with you guys are going to continue to err on the sky\nUm but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet because he's not the same rules of a cap it off for anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nWhen I brought him I thought it would slow them down I Would give them food for food for thought yeah I I mean\nYou look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking or basically not pursue this any further um maybe there's something there may be there that they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was was was made public a through this with with the league and everything else\nAh that and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the lead to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou their names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak so if that if\nThat law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case they\nBought by ... by march judge and or his lawyers who ever leaked in the media would also be partially responsible are forgetting his name out there and that you could see\nI think part of that and they have in any case that that was him yes you have any games eliminate because I think what they're getting the of the gang right that yes you're right that's clear yet right right\nRight the only possibility of backlash I'm figures you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at is joined us in spite of years we're going to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it then and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital I did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr ... claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I Am ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the Lincoln So Jessie wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctor or I'm just using ... that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other case to me that's clear I mean\nGoing going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm biking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out in print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat's how you got to make your case and the worst and probable cause well I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just to ebony personally\nWell I mean I'll be worth the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued there's\nWhat role did he play and pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and in filing suit in New York sworn statement the New Yorker\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing at that and you would have a case it leads to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens\nAnd couldn't find first hand knowledge and may be in this case there is the responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that are forced to al ... [noise] uh for soup and of course the New Yorkers printing of [noise]\nOkay well knows how to lay o buy point as we go point by point by\nWhat you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with her would share this fire at a at a chauffeur\nWhile I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe that and I got in their promise I ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nThat one ... that says that followed everybody to balance in Republicans' fall no I don't buy\nThat was coming who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese you know without which are all well and they don't get them but\nWhat does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because of reading Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office\nWould bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to ah the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's me which was in in a number of suffer crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would\nWould a prosecutor we said well it what mattered cheers the court of public opinion once you're dead and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's\nHere's the uh the the the point about before to cause it maybe he was responding ... and the veterans responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble that still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating she's lying about it but uh you\nKnow or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of when [noise] you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah a anything's wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it is\nAnd and our point was since Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in the upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats and they shouldn't be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed mhm ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for dimes Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nSo if you're angry that justices and all we've done all I can say this from our point of view the most important thing to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's these uh probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want to charge right sorry but that's just the way that it is\nPart of the power comes from public opinion and it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted ... and so the best we can do is get out the truth that we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nHis bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure we laugh when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colonies gives me you're on a wide and ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states\nA terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for every one in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you can read the law\nAnd and everybody would agreement that is what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told you I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we've we've got a couple of allies said don't want to uh to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I haven't any we went that doesn't make ... we're going to go to Michael Horowitz from my\nDive into my ... and I don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went down to ... ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties fight oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's gonna happen there but get a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing\nThat's on that and\nThat's that that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russian scandal thing\nWe said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the how do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because that's that's what play out in the public\nOver and over and over\nFor a very very long time\nEight six six

that will be moving very very quickly on it\nThe other thing is fast track to us so expected to head toward\nA the Florida Panhandle over the next couple of days and then moving up over south and North Carolina\nAnd then back out over water according to the current track and are they just updated that a little while ago or so or they could it could have wins somewhere in the eighty mile an hour range of of the time it doesn't make landfall there in Florida\nA year and a couple of days and then diminishing of overlap as they always do get expect that could be a category too though but yeah it hits the well and and that's it and it is right now the the forecast of course as they always do kind of change going back and forth and\nSo we'll follow it as in fact a John Will uh in our forecast and for ... here's your national forecast we\nBegin a week with a very active weather map ... there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on a tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impact continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrived by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from\nWest of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some impact as well that would be the Gulf side or western side of a state system expected to track right on up through southern Georgia\nThe outer banks of South Carolina and North Carolina is well throughout the latter part of the week heavy rain north and south of the line from just west of by thirty five today so for the upper reaches of the Northern Rockies\nThere's your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nThat kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond\nThe Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program did you do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public wants the leftist doing it'd be factual you don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated\nAs one caller said just play just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years of that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that over and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it is to this country or\nFor about the last so I'm\nGoing to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying\nThat it's never been easier to defend the conservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun a negative ad campaign with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that\nAnd it sells you don't have to add on\nTo any thing\nFrom what we have seen the last two weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be taught in any untrue right all you have to do is point out the truth of aware now and this is very very important\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe but the main stream and I think that one of the things that\nI have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know\nBut the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness\nThere is no sense of stability for they don't ... they don't care about you know are taking ... taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from independence on both sides and that they destroyed for his life by not keeping secrets then it went on to try to ... to destroy\nA camera on life on both sides of it\nIt seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lived we destroyed we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity we just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't\nPlay fair and I do think\nThat there is something here that it's even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if it goes in the paper of Republicans\nThat ... which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that moved in the Republican you know direction\nIt's going to be nothing because of okay will what will guards shouldn't cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA now it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive it I think it's going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight and I think if you look at it got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America\nThe left to may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them and that they're they're jumping on and in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims\nThe fact of the matter is that's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do with ... what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven background check\nAnd that Grassley gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case you know somebody\nIn front of a good point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in in many of the public's mind between the protesters in the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing that\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee are using the same argument\nAre they're basically ... the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what what's the tactic being considered\nThe first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Capitol ... it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents they buy the right word that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing as Democrats always do these days\nIt wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a rover your weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with sort of my or or Cajun you know what do you think if the government can\nThere are are taken you know what do you think if the government can the government force you to buy vegetables and you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left the main stream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California\nAnd certainly get praise there but the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or ... and her words and the others on that committee and their behavior\nAll of that\nCarries over into the election elsewhere it's not about her role I can see that and get reelected in Hawaii Kamala Harris can say whatever she wants to and get reelected in
