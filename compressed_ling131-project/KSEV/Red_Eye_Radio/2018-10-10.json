I had a tomorrow we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them and a half\nAfter it has passed by right but I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people of evacuating it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and we're all they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins [noise] um\nBut that being said\nEven though they're not going to be able to do anything\nWhen it's over with they're going to be\nIn there in force I Know\nAre surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks a\nHand or the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let me let me ask you this because you did or you had predicted before the last the advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of\nOf a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five two hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do you feed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening nose gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched\nSo we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near this and so [noise]\nUh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area ahead of the cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that ... mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore\nThis afternoon and\nAnd and they'll have periods where those gosh drop off to Seventy five miles an hour\nOr so and this is this is a fascinating point um\nYou you may not realize the savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen [noise] uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are the gusting up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia coast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um\nAll of that area um potentially as far up as Morehead City I'm going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of Florida and crosses Georgia across from Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and I guess to a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nHad on young and we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch and you get a bite South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe winds are going to bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area or are still pretty significant um um\nWe're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain\nUm and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia and Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of aid and trains while\nWhile uh and\nAnd that causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give me another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave your earlier but um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds and\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we bought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a a\nTwo ton pickup truck we're\nAt Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kinda bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great point what often there\nAre six the salt water six some level so it's going to look nice and flat and saluting all across it it's probably not going to be perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of walk gallons of water on a giant entire I all of the grocery store rolling across continuously\nEvery minute across the road what are the odds that it's going to tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces you read six inches right\nSo you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot possibly\nAssessed properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there is absolutely no reason to go through all high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations\nAnd heed the warnings of those local and state officials and the the that are there in Florida and those other states\nThat will be dealing with Michael over the

there are shelters that they if if you believe the structure you're in the home you're and I could not sustain it and they set up these shelters and if you cannot get out of the way the storm maybe you can get to the shelter but a heed the warnings if at all possible because this will be a deadly well\nAnd as we've been a total here since a mutt a hurricane Michael is set a hundred and forty

within the next five or six hours if not\nAlready you may be in an area where the water has started to rise up and that you may not be able to get out of there [noise] okay that time is closing and so they the weather service because they've never seen anything like this before a long coastline [noise] ah their pleading\nAnd saying if you have been told to evacuate leave and don't stay and don't risk the life\nYour life or the life or your family\nAnd you also have to include the thought that if you are in a situation and it becomes an emergency gave you can't get out of there that means first responders can't get to you\nThat's exactly right and and they've heard that message on their local television stations or radio stations and everything else but the reason people choose not to leave is because they go back to their own experiences and their own personal bias is limited\nAnd go right ahead I\nSeverely that simple\nWell and I know nobody that let's put it this way the vast majority of people who live there and we'll say nobody but the vast majority of people that live there have never seen anything like that and let somebody might have gone through hurricane Camille\n... and you mentioned bill when you mentioned you know the nearby air force bases and military personnel and you know I mean just any transient population maybe some tourists that are there people that just haven't lived there and as as that or even if you have for a long time get this is an unprecedented event\nThat means very few people relatively speaking have been through this if any in that area have lived through those kind of storm\nIn ... those those damaging when the water and everything else that becomes a threat very quickly\nYes and and and it means that\nThe people who are in charge of predicting that are now in a situation where all bets are off ...\n... yeah is that printed yeah I mean\nWe make a prediction and and and you normally say this about us whether guys well that they get it right fifty percent of the time and they still get to keep their job well maybe we are better than that but it doesn't matter because in this case\nThis is what we're guessing it it give us fifty percent of the time and if we're wrong by fifty percent [noise] forget it\nRight [laughter] exactly and and and that's again\nYou look at it to what you mentioned earlier it bears repeating here in ... in a well built structure a well built home new construction up to code and beyond that these high winds can rip a ... roof off and will do so in a half a second\nYeah and and that debris goes flying again you know into engineering and goes in and do your neighbors structure and we're we're talking about danger from several different elements of this storm and in this segment we haven't even talked about\nThe uh any given possibility and the potential at any moment for a a tornado or out of\nIt but this is just one big tornado rhyming winds up to a hundred and forty miles an hour we just got a big ...\nRight well let me ask you this because you know since we've been on the air and it was a hundred and twenty five announce on for a hundred and forty as it gets closer to the shoreline and I asked you this after each and every uh a new update ... is there a possibility that it could even get stronger\nYes yes\nYes because we're we're talking about a hundred and forty miles offshore and I can say this first hand uh three or four weeks ago I went down to Pensacola and I spent a couple hours floating in the eighty five degree water ...\nOkay and so this water is just prime the atmosphere\nAnd the air is moist and humid and it's a rich deep moisture that stretches\nWell up into the mid level of the steering currents and the latest meteorologist discussion that we read and breakdown shows that the serious layer above the storm has become more centric and has become more organized into the flow\nOf the jet stream that's carrying it away now if you've got a vacuum cleaner and it goes into a container that you can't evacuate the your plug the blowout ...\nThan that vacuum cleaner eventually stops working but in this case the what we're saying here is the outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunderstorm ... okay is well organized and\nAttach to the jet stream flow with mid levels and so it's a vacuum waiting all this warm moist air which creates an increase in the flow at the bottom of the storm\nAs we wrap up this segment and we thank you throughout the show you've been with us and we expect to be able to talk to you or tomorrow and go over and maybe we will be looking at a you know the again all the conditions inland and and what to expect\nFurther but give us a rundown on the timeline for Michael uh when I hit the shore\nAll the way you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should we expect and in the coming hours and days\nAnd I you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should be expected in the coming hours and days\nOkay um first Michael is going to be coming ashore it'll be just offshore and about eight o'clock in the morning [noise] ah I Can't tell the exact distance because of the\nPredicted speed is going to change and it'll increase heading into shore [noise] but let's say it gets to shore and about three o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon from there\nTwenty four hours later I'm like oh it's going to be passing underneath without a doubt or between Valdosta and make it\nA and Georgia\nOr from their um by the time we make it to tomorrow night it will be crossing the Georgia Carolina line\nAnd it will be moving its way in between savannah and Austin or Augusta I'm Sorry and a ... and and so it'll be basically following I Ninety five and it will be just about maybe twenty five or thirty miles inland by Ninety five\nProbably crossover Florence in Fayetteville as it heads up the coast I expected\nTo get off the coast somewhere in the Carolinas or the edge it for ... and then stay off the coast by the time we find it friday night it's going to be offshore and it will probably be offshore of um of Boston\nAll right All right oh in the ... and the next three days it's going to be moving and increasing it forward speed as it moves along as it gets caught up in that jet followed that I described that's a vacuum awaiting the heat and making it possible to be a giant heat engine right now\nRight a a wealth of information very valuable and get enough to actually like saving information from meteorologist Tom hale and we will talk to you a tonight as we start the Thursday morning program and all our thoughts and prayers are with those folks there and and those first responders and officials there in those states\nAnd areas that will be affected by hurricane Michael thank you Tom and we'll talk to you on the next show thank you\nLook forward to eight six six Ninety red eye the Detroit power train offers
