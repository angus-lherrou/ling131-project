automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right I Love lower and lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked and they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because\nFewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's main the main goal we talked about this yesterday\nWas to have companies in the United states producing it here and selling it elsewhere\nWell by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite right there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell\nMake cars here and sell them elsewhere because of all the rules and regulations we put on cars and all of North America in Canada and I have to say North American than say Canada Mexico and not in the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it and and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I ... the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt\nCar production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something going to say fine you're gone automation\nAutomation a that comes in Tempe comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating pardon\nWell keep in mind in two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash\nTheir their foreign arms their foreign\nBusiness was what was keeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect ... based on economics which is how people responded sentiment that's incentive

the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n[laughter]\nUh you know it's interesting that it seems like a after about two years Americans are paying attention fell into the Russian investigation the sixty five percent of Americans mold\nOr or you don't believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said that\nBelieve that Trump committed collusion and they want to find out in my ... and they're willing to release it to a very committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would\nGo a you know beyond that uh that typical party line number of St Louis you know if the people in the center being roughly wanting the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which means there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals\nMixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that it's\nGoing to show that he's guilty but with what we've been saying this doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to well we talked about earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant a application and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared for instance there's going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said 'cause we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guys just started talking about a casually on the air and saying\nHey I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know because what what what they're saying it's okay uh there there may be some some sort of things are in here we have some of our allies\nOr we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA ... we have some objection from our allies and we're going to put it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the same in an expedited way\nAnd we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do with whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because of the former CIA director and talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and an information I'm Christopher Steele that they didn't want released who still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to get to the inspector general of the United states who's all of a sudden the inspector general of the department of justice and\nWhose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice because\nYou look at the aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly uh you have Kelly in the room with him and then that advising as chief of staff where do you go with as I could see General Kelly looking does and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under these are all in the Obama administration\nIf that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right\nYes lot you take the politics out of it\nBecause you let the I. G. do all the investigation on it tell us what happens here because the guy who's going to have access to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees\nAnd really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that God has access to it directly yet\nSo the I. G. takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abused here we see this based on this uh on redacted material now from the Justice Department\nWill that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and\nSpecially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly going to have the authority to declassify that that's not the issue you take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... the it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to\nTo be handed over and you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yeah just declassified part of it right because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you contacted them everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all the sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about or that you know Deborah Nunez initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you would hear nothing\nRight and\nThe media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\n\nY G inspector general looking at all but they only he only looks at corruption right that's what he thought he was looking for corruption in the department of justice ... and all the sudden\nThey don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help it sits in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material he looked at it all ready\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia pro Trump didn't say what Russia probe right\nWhich one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia ... we initially thought\nYou know could because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers and but\nThe discipline of her mother's investigation right but on the tweets that Russian probe for and I went oh that must have been more investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be you know it may not be the investigation that they're talking about he didn't like the mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of behavior\nIn the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right and what was that pattern of behavior leaks to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump or almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have the situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side it if they're under redacted classified material\nHad damaging information about Trump would we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case\nWould he also turn it over to the inspector general if it were\n\nBecause it wouldn't serve him politically idols not required to turn it over to the ... right but I don't think\nThat I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of\nJust I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something on him all anger okay I'll do anything about whether it was actually wanted to show is legit yes that is going to go OK okay right that it is that the whole thing was legitimate gripe and it was based on something\nReal we haven't heard that and if that were the case when the president had it\nWhen he turned it over to the hygiene he he doesn't

information I mean as a binding legally I guess my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim is made\nIn regards to the Senate committee and consideration for Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court shots so would that not be part of the legal process\nAre her lawyers legally bound to turn that over I don't know that I didn't see anybody right it that way I'm just

know I had an interesting point I don't know that I have I don't yeah I don't know that either\nI don't yeah so it though because it's different before she testified and that's the first time he asked

'cause we we asked you know where's the FBI going with this background check are they going to talk to Ford's old boyfriend and for Jordan old boyfriend identified\nA a four and a girl friend identified her by name a ... as saying she told this woman I'll help you with ... and show you how to help you with\nA a a how to beat a lie detector test will they can find that woman and I said earlier she's alive the research that as she can only be a witness who she's alive\nBut if he's alive and they find her and she's willing to testify\nAnd she says yeah I mean under oath yes she\nHelped me do it you got a perjury charges everything falls apart it's already all of the cases are falling ... every day another layer is being peeled from these allegations against Kavanaugh\nI think right now and again you know I don't know the answer the question I asked earlier about her lawyers being compelled to ah to forward that information and materials that\nAre Chuck Grassley a call for bought assume that's not the case and they're not legally compelled to do so even still they would resist doing it uh I think they're going to resist whether they are legally compelled compelled or not\nBut the they're likely doing that white well\nBecause if if she's telling the truth during the lie detector test which they say I mean that's the whole point of all life is tucked protest is that you passed it\nExcept there were different questions\nIf they asked a different question and she answered that question truthfully she would pass it\n\nVideo and audio the methodology of that test is important\n\nAnd so if you use that as part of the proved to cooperate but it did happen yeah you were telling other people 'cause it doesn't cooperate the crime no it just it it just and we can't even get to the point of her the ...\nThe the what she said there's cooperation that she had been talking about this but she won't even let that evidence be seen all that evidence be seen which is\nSorry the therapist knows you brought it up you use that as evidence yet so you've been talking about it like you said you said certain things but you haven't released\nEverything that the therapist has sorry when you make the accusation and you say this is what back up not the crime because you have nothing to cooperate the crime so you're you came in with your lawyers as the secondary\nA point you were going to make well maybe you know where that hoping that the witnesses might cooperate you and they didn't\nSo your second point was but I've been talking about it for years and that should give me credibility\nAnd you won't release that evidence to the people who are the judges in this case mhm well then you lose even more credibility and that's why when they say she's credible\nWhen the members of the Democrats' Senate ... Judiciary Committee so she's credible or you can't make that case because on every single instance when you want to get to the credibility by getting more evidence that she actually has\nHer lawyers refused to hand it over because if she is telling the truth and has been all along why would you refused to hand it over in fact why would you not voluntarily handed over without being asked\nBecause here's the proof here's everything you need to know here are my notes are here the therapists notes here are here is the audio\nAnd or video from the lie detector test you would be out to prove that this happened isn't she out to prove it happened\nYeah well you you're going to hand over everything voluntarily why would her lawyers not encourage her to do that listen Dr Ford and this is going to vindicate you this is going to show why would you not doing that\nOr at least it sets a at least two sets of pat\nWhat's the ... it's it's the most evidence that you had that you even talking about it is and you decided to use you and your large decided to use it as evidence\nYet you won't present all of the evidence it helps build your case right it doesn't work that way right you have to begin with that would give you a little path\nTo go down and you're saying no sorry you\nThat I mean you would have you would want to provide everything that was within your control to provide what the other people say in terms of people corroborating her story or or or or not that's on them you can can you can't compel them to\nOr or or not that's on them you can't ... you can't compel them to a testify or you can't compel them\nA doctor for camp her lawyers can\nCompel them to talk to the FBI or any of that but what they can do what is in within their control is\nTurning over every piece of evidence that you have in your control and why would you not do that that helped to build your case you write Gary doesn't prove anything\nBut if your doctor forced position you're looking to be vindicated in show that this happened because you're being criticized and your credibility has been criticized\nOn along the way you have not proven your case\nYou would want to turn that over there if you're telling the truth you would want to turn over everything that you have\nIt everything within your power and that's it that it's all you have but it would be your your best attempt at being believed to hear I I I really believe that uh\nThat I think if I was a betting man that the odds that the reason that for lawyers want her to talk to the FBI again\nIs because she's going to remember people more witnesses here and and I think that we're merit to because ... said well we director the FBI to more witnesses out there because the whole point is to extend\nYes yeah even like the witnesses okay right we can do it while you have to talk to those because on the up y'all come back and say well we had to look let's say they come back right away to limitation we couldn't find these people will then we can vote on it until we find all these people to find out\nBecause they claimed that I Am a digital witnesses and the whole thing is just keep extending this weekend and week out again what getting ready to get out who sat on Sunday\nNight on ... on sixty minutes forget what they said about we think this was fair the week you know the the FBI or what they call the investigation\nIs the one week we believe it's fair yeah I'd I don't expect that position to hold if indeed you start you it comes back and it does not a show anything different than what we already know\nRight but I Do think that that's what's going on and say why don't you know why it was because of the rumors of or what we wanted them to some new witnesses out there and some new people to talk to and I bet you that's why Ford borders want her to talk oh there are I I just remembered more witnesses to this whole thing this ... and then you have to start the investigation over again\nAnd then while the FBI needs to work on this another week and investigate these people or do a background check on these people to and you just keep extending it looked I Do not think that the goal post at all have been embedded into any type of concrete that it's going to settle in the next week\nRight yeah\nI I just don't think we're going to see anything a change or nothing is going to be done\n[noise]
