fascinating last\nA few weeks after [noise] you know as I I just started thinking during the top of the hour after the last caller\nA you know public and said look I'm I'm a I'm I'm voting because uh I don't believe that\nUh you know popular opinion or you know should a substitute for uh\nPresumption of innocence and due process and I started thinking about it when you know you and I I said a lot of thought were the the one thing that I got out of the whole cabinet thing is the Democrats are trying to sell us that if you believed in due process and the mindset of due process and that the accusation alone isn't enough\nAnd you disagreed with them with this message think about this but if you don't believe the accused\nEven with them with this message thinking about this that if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor then you are an enabler although rapist of a gang rape it\nThat's what they were trying to sell it think about that and that's why every ... when he said you know he's probably because of that\nThat I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason to matlock to law and order from 'cause I think law and order started what an eighty nine or\n... I yes Eighteen eighty nine [laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows out there uh-huh\nRight for that and and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the

have\nIgnorance simply means you lacked the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the facts and you can go search for the facts or that you're dumb it simply means you don't have the facts

trying to sell to the American public after how many decades um television shows hounding lawyer shows that are over and over again where it has become\nAbsolutely crystal clear to any American out there you need evidence before you and convict somebody eating they're saying no that thinking about that that's their biggest push going into an election mid term election is the fact that no no

pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nUh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier and for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump or the campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election ... with the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law for\nHer ... who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see huge and GPS was hard well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n... really know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty nine\nOr after the lawyers said it's Clyde would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nHuge fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the dog she ate\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course the lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the true\n\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find\nHere's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a a who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nI I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I Would either going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the\nAnd an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there\nBetween Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he\nHe but he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because of because\nSee oh he but he yes from the department of justice yeah well yeah because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes divide from the department and I and then again if the those are ... that's a number of it\nRight away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because fusion GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut not so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do that you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still presented anyway\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand them what I Would wonder is a\nLens Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take another word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right that I Would ask his lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned but it's the same thing as a mall or investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations as going it's at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know um when I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money for ... third opposition research firm that jumped on the level is is that is what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite while the what they do opposition research itself it's wind a Tory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they do what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell\nAt at heightening the ... it's interesting\nLook I say this because Donald Trump junior I testified I'll go under oath ... there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr it's there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating his firm\nYeah\nThose are the questions that what those are questions on the investigator would have run into their mind yet ... yes that's all\nWe're not indicting anybody yet [laughter]\nHey I'm just

give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and you said we're going to you know meet\nA yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market it's tempered today is

also the state\nThat was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left\nThey didn't move to the right to be clear but a ... on that\nOn on that point she is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supporting John McCain\nRight yeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with same conservatives are welcome in New York right yeah even the ones that are\nThere as we know that I and in writing just being on you get ...\nYou can get away with that New York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and you can end\nDemocrats they look I Know all those people are not everybody is crazy and we're not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona that's\nThat's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nI remember he said he doesn't have an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in the state yeah that's a huge number of people that are defined by the\nWay um you know this and this is that's that that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience not gun rights it's my rights\nAh yeah the gun doesn't advertising doesn't that doesn't have any right by a gun has no right\nThe gun doesn't have any rights I assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold lives fingers it's the people's right\nYes a very interesting I just want to get to the top because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this ... employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually in these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nAnd you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet\nBut the design of seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the chaos cause even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city or for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you said at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free it'll cost you whatever you lose and video\n[laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free now that uh uh just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lungs money on it no I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm hey I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nA ... but but for the bar it they'll move away from\nBartender oh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah like I guess by the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston than we have to talk of every did last week I well I mean you know if you think about\nRemember the old and I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine where would make your ... yes yes I was go back to the Terminator two\nA security guard making the or it was a top of that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well no it has to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotic in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically a quarter it\nYou know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\n... by automation\nYou know I think John ...\nA guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know tappers caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do that well either one but I\nDid here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap for how far can you go with the robot bar tender ... kind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have there is is that right because he talks about the science of a bar mhm and\nThe science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot camping plans it\nTrust me I Know a few of them\nWell a robot also can be angry either write him being angry bartender right\nOr can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] wow that's that but how how far do you go with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nMy wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it because it was often like they have a a a a what would you say that it there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk out\nYou what would you say that it there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has you know a dealer but its its enemy right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated well\nOn this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center\nAnd you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation things still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right animation records that well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas and in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting and nightclubs are huge in in Vegas\nUm where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender right they used to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carry maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas that's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol ah it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nA yea going you walk into your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right from ten different types of alcohol that you put in their front and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go oh and then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] I Know like the [laughter] I doubt it out [laughter] and then I suffer all alcohol a lifestyle drinking alcohol [laughter] hey I Want to get drunk [laughter] hey six Ninety red eye\nVince engine report is brought to you by\nDetroit ...
