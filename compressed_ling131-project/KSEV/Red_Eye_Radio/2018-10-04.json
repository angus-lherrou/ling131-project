to unite them back to coming home to the Republican Party\nAnd a couple of things that they wrote here there's the Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they did miss Ford's name from

high FBI law enforcement official ... a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met with the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks\nBefore the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting ... campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Cooley the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds shuts so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats the ... you\nKnow they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found on since that time was and nobody dispute [noise] what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary\nClinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the crumbling\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know with the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins Cooley that really when you look at it they're the ones that started the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and when we got to the law firm\nThey were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right\nAnd I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and leave the agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess a compartmentalize that is part of an investigative process why would why would the counsel for the FBI to say well as well as he says\nTo talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers\nRight why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys made it\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was what the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compiled a dark ca oven cooperate and raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees that sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect the dog she was connected to the DNC is mainly law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows a real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins Kuwait law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah I'm going to accomplish\nThis this could be twenty four yeah if you do a capital of the law you could do probably more seasons and law and order a couple of seasons ever because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been out for such a long time I do believe that you know you could included in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change because of change then to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and then in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today is\nHeld by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned as blonde the vast majority of it it's fall after after after over after over two years right so\nAnd and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that it was to destroy the legitimacy or they lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information that information and\nAnd ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research\nTo the fights of court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump yes they don't make the heat treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party\nAnd all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole ... everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that is\nBut it tried even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together and the last two years here's the problem with\nSomething go on for so long where it is active because they didn't feel active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven though right now in the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story start falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's quite a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a note cooperation for these particular stories like they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we've seen in what the Democrats dead wood Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret\nTests\nNow that we know how background checks for gun and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred and I and we know the process yes they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this thing move forward\nOr if if you look at this I mean this is where we got to have done that in July we may not know Dr Ford's name because if it was part of the free oh two and was not backed up by anything\nThat information wouldn't have been made public it wouldn't have been made public anyway to vote just would have happened and it would have been either yay or nay on Capitol eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas a more red are ready to go with a record ...

Cleveland to buffalo on a Ninety your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOn a total nonsense judge okay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter]\nIt in other news uh this from the held on Tom this is breaking news yesterday afternoon and the yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official dispatches from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured and search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ...\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for Perkins ... the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nThat suffer amused by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dark Ga\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated law intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee that sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined\nTo divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... uh conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive we've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking because once you have there you have you have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you had them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon\nTest to find the tie and we worked ... there was no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer but typically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly joined a record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduced prices there's some Bloomberg now mhm\nOPEC largest producer was currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the records set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrel she said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insights from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump now we talked about it 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil\nIn the war yep we beat started we'd be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved there's Venezuela a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that were saying you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably\nGood\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion or you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else was always the the number one category leading this mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have him out to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the right\nEars that once we realized that the regulations only regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump or he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia mhm excuse me we're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding with your military were were there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member ideal pact member [laughter]\nVery Adele Batman the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in any way\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there is no other Republican that could have gotten\nThe cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax threat no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one of the point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um the whatever wealth starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreements and we said look we put this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original care of their original terrible [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we can certainly said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who's a leading a columnist for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing\nYet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parks rules requiring more production in North America highway or higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles life even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these are rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive\nSaid some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production damage simply pay the the two point five percent Tara and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and I hope the limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but it's really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as a result the new NAFTA and even though the name has been changed right\nAnd it's subtle along are we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you wind up basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then\nOnce it all worthwhile and the farmers saying just days ago that you know their their bail out that they got their government money they don't want that that they really did because that's not going to be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that sales would help\nTo six Ninety ... the Detroit power train offers a fish and sea fruit innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Tomball", "day": "04"}
