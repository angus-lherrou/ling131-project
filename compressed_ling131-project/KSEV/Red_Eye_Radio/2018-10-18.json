presidents he only wants to be one percent of Americans for tax reform and you can reach them at eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions and we'll we use that in a what I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cuts passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful for ... a lot of things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals\nTop rate was Seventy percent it that is high is Ninety percent during World War two a Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it from Seventeen to twenty eight [noise] unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards south over forty percent and a show at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the world or the rest of the world started experimenting with lower\nBusiness taxes or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economically a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business taxes nine percent\nWe're at thirty five we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how come we can't compete with China and Germany and stuff like that we are all into our lose business taxes twelve and a half percent\nA week what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local government so really thirty nine on average and or the Republicans truck that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax credit than most of the country's law the average European ... about twenty five ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five twenty five\nAnd they would be that's when they said let's say I doubt that will be invested a billion dollars where do I put a chip I invested I hate ... thirty five percent of everything I\nIf I put it in Germany they only take tribal titled surely pot and we shipped in that camp and we're seeing a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment out of Europe it it gets a for starters though as a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was earnings by American companies\nOver shapes and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nPunished you if you brought laid back that states leftover shapes as maybe three trillion dollars to the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show ... trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy\nAnd we said you know we're not doing that anymore if you earn money United States we tax yet but if you're in ... the French people take some\nAnd then we have but you got to bring up the holiday America good no taxes no power no penalty for bringing like factor that that how about that and uh\nWe sit in a tremendous again half a trillion dollars five minute and come back the last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety million dollars of earnings overseas they ... billion right back\nAnd said you know what because it's no longer pedal eyes to move buddy from London to New York or tax us um\nWe may not bring it all back now to talk on the attack but right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it gets\nShow that money might as well already be back but we've seen a half to try and come back I'll eat it and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and Brazilians making decisions are sending their money to the United states rather than the ... it's really irritated Europeans because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah no I can see why it seems to me all these things seems to me I have a couple of more questions are going to get some of the callers questions for you also\nBut right now we're going to take her in our national forecast for how many trucks\nLake effect snow on Lake Ontario on\nPortions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester and buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA over to Cleveland, Ohio on my eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in

weather preparedness week in Colorado reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is look at your national forecast for him right on the radio on meteorologist John trout\nAnd here's your chance any\nQuestions or comments you have on taxes Grover Norquist land sue them for\nYou Mary tax reform Marcus\nA maze with very yeah it make it clear that you know let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nThink ... I'll tell you what you get to the words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always\nThought flat tax and it's ... percent a cross support\nIt don't matter whether you're a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there I got all seven percent fewer lemonade every the drug scene that there is as far as I say I'm with the taxi eliminate\nAll federal tax is whether it's the field tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name it fits all federal tax it no longer exists you will limit\nThe sixteenth demand and that in order to\nRaise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for\nIt be for it to be come a ballot or the election of\nOn every two years that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register\nVoters in order for the taxes to be right and I think you know and as you just mentioned uh it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me once people realize how much they're paying out and taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter\nI couldn't believe how much I was helping\nTo play out in Texas [noise]\nInteresting Grover what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California and Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted one section because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which you take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes\nIt really slows the tax and spend as down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support or to an act and it I think they flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes\nOr would dramatically change our policy carriers\n\nBut do you think about some people propose the sales tax the consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production for if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax at some of your PIN countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket\n'cause everybody would buy their stuff then down the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck a\nSo they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays at the guy who\nTrucks goods into town pays at a twenty percent on his ... to ... to ... percent tax but he had little amounts and there's no one place where you can avoid ah the difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax up at the national sales tax a value added tax which gets every level of a production pot it's why they have higher taxes that we knew that stupid income taxes and highest income taxes you can only get so much money out of an income tax\nPeople will quit working out for around to hide money um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do we don't have a ... tell me was that no no we want to\nSweat whether the income tax you have a national sales tax a direct tax in stat bunch kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that send overseas or\nIt will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could and I'm for\nBringing the income tax down towards Sarah I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tack Swiss who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ... how would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket a\nHit you makes you feel better somebody else's writing a check but everything you buy from your house chair car cheer\nCheer for dear close would cost more than the taxes would be hidden in that so um I think going to a single right tax income tax ah and reducing spending his ... to go to know if you got\nTaxes down enough that you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know that's a ... percent sales tax just got to kind of a plot or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that\nBut you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk bath and you'd really have kept protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax traumatic country had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the part of politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right he is part of this have you know give me this donation someone in a lower your taxes\nAnd as part of this have you know give me this donation someone in a lower your taxes is they don't want to think solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions thought on my part\nHaving taxes that I'm a complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people that we're ever going to hang up one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and counts maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what commissioner him how do you know what do you know and if the Democrats ... take the house [noise] what do you think about what's going to happen in the tax situation [noise]\nI have to take the house they'll be tax cuts for the next two years or they will do push-ups protects says a lot of space to try and knowledge and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes a trade and a half ... they want to raise the uh try and from what we worship that's ... trillion dollars in taxes\nFor a decade that they want to increase taxes probably pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they want to get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want the military to get pay will only do that only passed a budget\nOr the soldiers and airmen and Tim and by ... ... ... they spent two years trying to get a tax increase um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working I was\nI'm like Democrats on the tax issue like teenage boys a prime they they keep asking for the same thing in different ways that just gather they get it again that keep coming back but they weren't one thing going higher taxes are and they were asked that question\nTwenty different ways of the green and taxes it will save the planet all day and the taxes at all they pay the other people a day while we pack against the same tax increase and as always\nMeant maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything as you weren't going\nTo talk about it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah yeah\nA lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of ... proposed a tax for Roman Norquist president Americans for tax reform that people get in touch with him\nAt our website it's H. E. R. dot org ah and we have a list to follow the companies that have ways to pay raise benefits um because of the tax cuts kind of a chair dot org and like I I tweeted acclimated our question\nWell terrific things for given so much time and I support what you're doing and thinking of joining us on red eye radio\nWonderful thank you for having me\nAbsolutely and we'll take the rest of your calls eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine mark guys for filling in on red our radio\nEngine reporters brought to you by Detroit\n...
