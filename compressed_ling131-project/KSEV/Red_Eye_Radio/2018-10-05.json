the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh read the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential firsthand knowledge of the allegation so there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge\nOf the allegations we've heard from a the Ramirez lawyers that mono she had twenty people she wanted him to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against Kavanaugh\nBy California professor or Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove for close to the party and Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a

outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president would draw the nomination and that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the ... got the\nThe greater or I guess the stronger or the foot hold got by the president and of course denominator himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed there's nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can uh appeal\nTo either

know at this point in the uh after they have the official cloture vote it will be a thirty our you know a clock ticking up for debate it could go less than thirty hours\nA depending if the Democrats you know want to extend it right now it looks like thirty hours\nYeah or if there's a lot of live t._v. coverage of it\nOut which are may or may not be I I don't know but on a Saturday on a cable news channel it's very decent chance at any of them were all of them will be covering it live throughout the day\nThat that is the case during that thirty hour period uh your usual suspects who may be

I don't know I'm thinking I don't want to say sir\nOr a Democrat or jobs and better ward said he's not interested in endorsement from President Rocco bomb it and she attempts to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterms in\nIraq was speaking after a town hall at a local high school when addressed and he addressed the unsettling fact that Obama has endorsed eleven Texas Democrats not including himself I don't think we're interested he suddenly endorsement right I'm so grateful for him for service he's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents\nAnd yet this election is on Texas\n... so there you go\nWell it it again you can take the money from the liberals outside of the state but you you cannot bring it in because here's what he knows a couple of things\n[laughter]\nUh many people especially people in the middle and and on the right who are going to vote for him anyway but they're the ones in the middle who\nJust might a would be many of them turned off by Obama but beyond that\nWhen you look at Obama and his effect on the left it doesn't hurt at all that'll work turns them down what is that tells you about Obama and his influence on the left\nAnd the fact that it doesn't matter you can probably say I don't want us endorsement right doesn't affect anybody at all you know ... years they don't get a lot of the DNI like Nancy settled by mail thinking about ten years ago right now but\nWell and think about going back I don't know go back to um\nYou know the post just back to the Clinton years so go back to uh the mid term of two thousand to write and imagine someone said that then of a Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton you know wasn't the deity that Obama was\nBut\nIt's still in a situation like that back then that would have been done behind closed doors right if somebody on the left was like yeah let's in\nA you know we're trying to just do this on our own uh you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as a an endorsement on on the ticket\nNow you can just do can we say yeah we're we're ... we're over Obama\nWe don't need\nI mean really it is the major major he's yesterday's news desk but it's the major blue states\nWhere he gets applauded but the question\nYes but it's the major blue states where he gets applauded but the question is does he really happening usefulness to the party itself\nIf you think about the the like when he uh gave us a list of in endorsements remember who's back and when that came out mhm [noise] kind of like his bracket used to be [laughter] but it really kind of had the same political impact as actually I could say that\nHis bracket used to get more news [noise] [noise]\nRight well on ESPN and did not know that I ... and our culture I don't know I don't get right out of it and I ... well yeah that was a surprise for different who she said yes yeah yeah yeah um no you must have political by bringing ESPN and I mean you got here you know he\nWas and then the endorsement list really I mean it came out and maintenance rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presents\nYou know by Obama and that might be his choice I mean they've been saying what they hanging out I didn't see the stories here's what he's reading this summer nobody cares\nNo one cares I remember that story no one here's what's on his reading list for shows him you know on a on a couch you know somewhere probably in Martha's Vineyard no body cares but\nIt hasn't been the political impact and in that\nPart is I mean for the right it's kind of been that way for a while George W was kind of went off and then he retired he really didn't say\nA lot and I have a question and it's just popped into my mind yet today and you just be made you just reignited the the flame and my brain ... a ... which mentioned uh Martha's Vineyard yesterday and buy something known as a liberal island yet right are there any conservative islands\nInfections

welcome snow Dershowitz said he thought welcome Martha's Vineyard I actually asked this question in my mind uh because a friend a well I actually someone in the house was watching\nSomething where there was um there was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were it was part of reality t._v. show\nBut the based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought bottom Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right and I thought to myself there isn't a conservative\nFlights like that [laughter] and there really isn't so I mean because\nI don't know I mean you don't I well we don't look for safe spaces\n[laughter] you know go by water safe [laughter] you really have to make an

candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is far to some ship [noise] and I think the framers of our\nConstitution never intended the confirmation process look anything like hey great yeah\nI ... and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's it's telling that\nWe're at this point and still at this point in fact tighten your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on ... late Saturday or\nSunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all this chaos before the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delight delay it as long as you can in hopes\nAn outside hope I get that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but as president\nAnd and now we know very clearly that certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all the time and place\nWell you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone includes you being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it and anything was used on a you know again you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberal used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is\nAnd it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know antifa anti fall as we call it it's supposed to be anti fascist yet what did they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism and say you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here what you see\nHere from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you'd see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and\nBelieve me if she used her that the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that in the mindset of a fashion yes that's not the mindset\nOf somebody who believes in the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks to me therefore he's a fashion no wonder is it backwards and what is he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand and I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hated Trump where it stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and lies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say well this is somebody who we really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics\nUsed against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they light and then they realized oh no that can hit him that it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindsets they'll pick out an attractive target to get people\nYou know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill and all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late and then since then\nAnd then we looked like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party\nBut remember it only go so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you've seen is the mindset of a fashion\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name and factors condensed down to those condensed from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people\nFor thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail and New York we can find your business to the extent\nThat you will be out of business tell me that's\nNot fascist you you don't create the arts\nTell me that's not fascist\nYou you don't create the ours that somebody which is you to create we will destroy your business you wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will ... you\nOut you'd think like us you behave like gosh you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and uniting realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing a bit of this is not the fringe this is the main stream at least in the Senate Judiciary committee in the mainstream power of the Republican or tsunami of the Democratic party\nThan you have a Maxine\nWaters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and\nGet in their face every chance you get and all the sudden you've got pushed back\nYeah right\nBecause the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do mhm let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they had yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough and then more people will start rejecting\nThe the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party you know as you're always say tell us where we're wrong\nYou can't eight six
