Dot Earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is you know that that that there are human rights violations and governments oppressing their\nPeople things like that around the world and we will have always done that throughout our at you know throughout our two hundred year two hundred and fifty year history [noise] um\nSo when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government can do I think the government can the courage business to go down at ... some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries in helping to rebuild those countries so there are\nOther ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original point couldn't agree with you more I think that's why we can't pay\nA that every single person in in every other country that happened to be living below the poverty level because we have from Americans who are struggling in the United states for that but we also need to take care of who we need to put them first and that's what we need to do we need to start putting America First ahead of the rest of the world's problems\nNow and I want you to clarify this for me see if I understood it some someone just gets the lego over higher side of the border they can then legally required to sign up\nThey can they can legally request asylum ethics and\nThe definition of asylum though is you have to have your\n... back to their home country from your government because of their race religion political views or a social group that you belong to that practice federal law but that also an awful lot however what we've seen over the last decade or so is that a very very first stop\nTo claiming violent you're in the United states is that you have what's called a credible fear interview\nIn the in that interview you say that I have a fear of returning back to my country because of X. Y. and who well what happened was really lowered the credible your standard so that somebody could claim\nCriminal gang violence for domestic abuse or or something like that but it got hooked on a lot of the actual definition of\nA runner highly as so because of that we allow people to claim asylum who don't actually qualify for asylum by the time before ... such as that their kids read that but I learned when they're sent back called\nSo what the what the administration led by attorney general Jeff Sessions that act by that our homeland security the tribe the credible you know but that doesn't cause a whole lot of those\nAudible books that's why it's so important for this\nWas not that type of our oil as as the United states to prevent them from going in the country that they want to claim asylum to that credible in our lives outside of the United states ... once they get in there getting out so we can't let them all [noise]\nYeah but they can they can pretend that need their advisors lawyers whatever can tell them what to say I don't know how you prove a negative you prove that they don't have fear the harm or a person who's not that have money back to their country and how do you do and anybody I'm just trying to say can claim that they're trying to say the right words\nWell usually I mean usually but that that that the state department off at the federal government is usually pretty aware of what type of government persecution are happening on a country by country basis so\nThat we haven't seen much of us you know Cleveland or the author of violations rates and showing a night and then on the other countries you know you know that we know that is is the rhythm North Korea for example\nAnd she believes you're you're not a communist that you're going to be persecuted within that country you know the Christians the middle east of Austin persecuted\nBy the government because of the religious beliefs or individuals I met at least a person\nKid by the government because of their religious beliefs or individual Middle East was hit by the government because of their sexual orientation thinks like that\nSo I Do those things are happening and the government either is aware of them or came quickly investigate into them\nBut when they you know again in the process of before so when they were able to just say well I have a fear of criminal violence while you either I allow them to enter a system that that was bad so out of a sudden they can't they can still make a false claim all the other side of the\nThings we can all that's the gate whether or not that claim as likeable likely to make sure we're not all while they're outside of the country like I said once they get in states\nThat easy for them to disappear into the into your face and we never hear from yeah\nYeah well we want to hear from you again if I have a number of questions I still want to ask you if you have a question from Chris out their eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight
