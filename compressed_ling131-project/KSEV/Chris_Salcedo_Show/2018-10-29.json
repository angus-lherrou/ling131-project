C. V. to a one size five eight five Seventy eight let's go to Eric who's listening in spring branch and our thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of taxes\nOn it much but yeah I mean basically I've just been a lot of a not a lot like three of my friends I think Facebook a first or the eight and a lot of the things that they just they are you know Christian conservative ideas\nAnd I've just noticed that it increased over the\nYou know six months to a year I'm\nAs well as just a bunch of misinformation um for instance my wife says that ah there's a bunch of democratic votes that they're trying to stay that are being oppressed by the Republican Party which um I don't know where she got 'em or even if\nThey're just only going to be careful about when it comes to social media and\nI'm not saying it's it's not happening is clearly it is happening there is a suppression of conservative speech and Republicans and conservatives they're they're clearly out there and they're suppressing it\nNow the way they're doing it there are certain people that I Know on Facebook that get thrown in Facebook jail on a ... there's just one instance I see people get a Twitter will have a ban on Twitter and that kind of look at our Jones\nAverage Joes was banned from YouTube Facebook Twitter ... I mean he's man from everything okay now I don't agree with what Alex Jones is he's an entertainer okay but is is he is the hurting people getting people killed\nIt's it's not him but then the fact that they shot him down the the interesting thing you've really colored by the way we can take a break and come back with your age on the other side of Asia hang on we'll get to you as well\nThe interesting thing about these social media sites is they do seem to be very subjective in how they're going to\nWill enforce the rules and it tends to be more often than not with the big shut down um eight hundred Facebook pages you're not too long ago most of them are Republicans were conservative groups there absolutely hate groups on Facebook there are people who are going to be looking at ... certain things there are things that can clearly be considered hate\nPeople followed his social media this monster the murder the Jewish people or synagogue they would have seen that this guy was about to do something really bad and possibly could have stopped him\nBut did he get shut down no he didn't\nNot until the moment they find out who he is in his name is released then Twitter or Facebook or whatever they immediately go shut down their pages then they'll do it\nYou're not hearing about it from them they don't wanna talk about it it's going to talk them votes what's happening is that the president goes down each time does this mean so this is not a waste of time I would absolutely loves the president aren't as many as we can afford I Would sit down there and try to stop every single one of them but it was just stop them that is not only in show of force one from our side\nToo if you stop many of them from coming across the border to get around all of them clearly\nAnd then you do your best and then from that you watch where they try to go to get in and then you work on that he's starting to build the wall attorney started San Diego\nAnd their past they don't like it I think you were the college a brief period it let's go to Dave who's been patiently holding and Katie day things were hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nYeah I'm you're brought up with a social media the\nCatching people yeah yes\nAnd a lot of people don't understand that's not the magical thing that's just fair and everything like that out or whatever is just a program that people so\nWhatever terms and stuff around the algorithm that they want to catch it certainly there\nAnd they're never in a release from say okay here's our own rhythm here's what we're looking for because they know it's perfectly targeted for conservative side so they claim quote unquote oh the outer rhythm gotta know it's a programmer or people that put stuff up\nSo it's not this magical that's quote fair if not\nMore absolutely no you're right on to have its you know\nI I'm an IT guy so I Know that's an outdoor though it's just a computer program and whoever rights ... whatever they want\nMore you know yeah you're dead on did they get really cold day with a you nailed it you're right Albert learnt magical things he's exactly right the programmers put it in there you get caught up and saying the phrases words whatever they put in there to catch it\nAbsolutely and then what happens is now I think supposedly once we don't know because they won't give us their their whole device them how they run their their whole info on how they run their businesses but then it gets triggered it goes to somewhere else and then it gets reviewed we have no idea clearly he's ride clearly they tore ... conservative they have a disagreement\nIn the way you know we live in a snowflake society now those on the left you got kids run around and say they got P.
