Sellars said Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read of course he's referencing the Chris Rock's get and then the other the other commentator terrorists that's minor says black folks are about the trade Kanye in the racial draft\nThey've added with him he's an attention or like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration\n[noise] how come they're all of a sudden so racist or hate on ... has been around for Twenty years right man or a long time\nHe's made lots of money and they all loved them\nUntil he decided to not be a Democrat anymore now they're really upset to anyone five five eight K. C. V. Y. CNN so racist and here's my question why is that they run around these people on CNN\nTo all of these ... these hardcore leftist these people they consider themselves be so much smarter and so much better the Hollywood types whenever it comes to racism and sexism\nAnd homophobia they're the worst ones\nDid you watch Rosie O'Donnell and all the clowns in Hollywood melt down on Lindsey Graham was homophobic slurs\nAnd then now you've got quote what they call a token negro out of ... they they made it legal racism immediately go racist\nWhy did they get ... or are we the only ones on TALK radio calling these clowns out\nTo eat one five five eight five seven three eight there laughing about it racism is a Larry's isn't it it is when they're doing it\nTo a one five five eight five seven three eight to eight one type of a case to be if you want to join us I just think it's sad that we live in a time now where if you're a black person and you don't agree with them then all of a sudden they become full on racist for his rage and the racial draft to what happens when need rules don't read I\nHave a feeling that Kanye West probably reads twice as much as the car sellers and once again I'm not a ... fan\nI look at him just like I look at just about anyone else he's a weird guy he's a rich guy he married into a really weird family even talked a little bit about that when he was with the ... but\nThese people are laughing and just with ... I think that we don't want to trivialize mental illness but all in their ... continued to smear ...\nAnd the token negro\nI mean can you imagine if a white person there was a white guy but he made a point to stay away from those words which is good can you imagine if a conservative was to say that about anyone Connie included\nSome wind CNN all of a sudden she's going full on rapist [noise]\nWell I think nobody over to Breitbart breaks down pretty good things we've been talking about\nWhether they know we're not CNN is borrowing from the playbook of the worst racist in American history during the tragic ugly history of slavery and the pre civil war era white slave owners ruthlessly and vitally punished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves or think for themselves\nIt was illegal for them to read in ... talked about that today\nIt was about controlling them in maintaining power over them that's what they do they still do this and not only in our country was not just me do this to other people but these other countries look what they do\nGo to parts of Latin America with the parts of Asia the middle east the way they subjugate people what they do and county west talked about this so he was talking about the abolishing the thirteenth amendment\n... you're wanting a point you made that no one's really talked about it was almost brilliant he said they made the thirteenth amendment to abolish slavery but a black person who tried to read that if they could in fact read that it was against the law and they would be thrown in jail that's an interesting point isn't it\nNonetheless it's what they do now we're talking about the Democratic party so you have a black man who's ventured away from their politics what are they doing I mean you just subjugate him we need to be faced him when he's mentally ill he's a token negro now they say\nWe need to train them from the ... you weren't literally defining missed\nWe need to train him from the ...\nYou know literally defining this man by his race not the content of his character you people are clowns over CNN you're a racist idiots you're begets\nDuring the post civil war era up after mind your room or Republicans freed the slaves from the Democrat plantations the Democrats formed a group called the Ku Klux Klan\nIs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party in order to to intimidate suppressed and destroy the political activities of the newly free black population who were active and elected Republicans\nUsing murder torture terror white hoods Democrats punished and made a public example of any black man or woman who dared thing for themselves who's threatened the Democrat power structure\nIt's a scary thought but that's what was happening\nDuring the era of Jim Crow why Democrats codified these tactics and the law again to suppress any black political activity that threatens the white Democrat power structure last written in past my Democrats legalized racism and segregation and made it nearly impossible for blacks to vote\n[noise] other than the tactics nothing has really changed much apparently it was a modern day Democratic Party to claim to be for African Americans don't you dare I have a difference of opinion you will be destroyed\nTo protect their power to ensure some Ninety five percent of black people continue to vote for them why Democrats primarily through establishment media outlets like CNN or still doing everything they can do to control African Americans\n[noise] time and again witness Clarence Thomas Herman Cain Congolese arise Jackie Robinson candy so and by the way a protester liberal called her and said you're not a black person Dr Ben Carson they did the same thing Allen West who my like a lot in fact I Need to reach out to LA and get them back on the program [noise]\nUh we watch free thinking black men and women personally destroy the political and media campaigns wheeling ridicule intolerance and he's a ... states are mercilessly slandered as dumb negroes\nToken negroes house negroes or crazy sellouts uncle Tom's Oreos and they're just not really black anymore\nSounds awfully racist sounds awfully like what's coming out of CNN\nToday [noise] doing one five five eight K. U. C. V. if you want to join us two one five five eight five seven three let's go to Tony Tony thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nA hang on such a great job of or in the truth [noise]\nUh you know one of the things that Democrats had an airplane or your southwest offers yesterday yard every every every down here every player you got a question\nTurn it around and something your water this or that they will not listen to the fact that oh my goodness who were the transmission and the Congress they were all Democrats\nWho started straight or a Democrat who still continuing slavery black or we don't want to hear that or not an airplane\nPets you at very good points and you're right I mean they don't want to talk about Robert Byrd neighborhood veered that man when he died because supposedly he had come to see the era of his ways but that was a what would you like a grand wizard and the Ku Klux Klan\nYes Klux Klan was surely started in the late seventies or eighties why a credit card or ...\n... the interesting thing is I think for the call Tony interesting thing about the Ku Klux Klan a lot of people don't know their history what happens when the freed slaves were out about their end to this day there's a lot of white people Hispanic people are saying why the ... the African American community there very spiritual okay\nAnd these Democrats knew that and they preyed upon it so what they did is they put on the hood to be ghosts from the civil war\nThey were the ghost coming back meant you can't kill them you can't stop them no matter what you try to do\nThey do take these poor uneducated black that had been recently freed weren't allowed to get an education and try to scare them into oblivion and then they would take them out and Lynch them and murder them and hang them and burn them and do terrible things to the African Americans to the black people in this country [noise]\nAnd Chris thank you for taking my call shovel under like ... points if I could tell you why I as a black man think black people won't come out of the Democratic party\nBut first of what I tell you a little bit something about me as a twenty year old college sophomore\nWatched the debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter and at the time if you'll remember the Democrats foreign policy was mad mutually assured destruction ...\nHe won't be the first ... Lucas and vice versa and also\nThe first time the fan because they own Lucas and vice versa and also the economy was in shambles it was so bad that created a term called the misery index\nYep you\n... ... inflation rate the unemployment rate and my primary interest rates are gather and it was a low forties which airs terrible well after watching that debate\nI voted for Ronald Reagan for president I had never been introduced to anything Republican in my life I grew up in St Louis Missouri in a black neighborhood\nI went to a Catholic school and the black neighborhood and what choice historically black college and university or something on the inside of me sad what surely Carter's trying to sell its not for me and I never been a Democrat\n[noise] the reason I think right people won't come out of the Democratic party and now it's because of the fear mongering that they do every four years\nThey'll run their presidential candidate out there are factors church in Atlanta and tell the most outrageous live like the black churches or under Bush and Ashcroft and the Republicans don't want to couch all the sensors\nAnd people CNN's cameras\nWill catch African American senior citizen of the ladies literally passing out in their seats and they'll play that on the news over and over and get those images and grain and for the black people and they're afraid\nTo come out of the Democrat Party and vote Republican because of the fear mongering even with this last Kavanaugh\nNomination last words hold that we'll be right or relegated to a segregated lunch counters if Kavanaugh gets on the court and he will notice that us on Nineteen fifties or sixties term lunch counters there are no lunch counters anymore we have restaurants now\nAnd the owner of the restaurant wants and customers no matter what color they are but Democrats are always used that sort of language scare black people\nEnd up voting Democrat to protect their\nErrol not only would you say there's a first of all thank you for the call second of all\nEverything that you just said as from your perspective is incredible you come from a situation where you're not taught anything about Republicans or conservatives him or anything but then you clearly have an open mind and looked at in ... for yourself and and made the decision\nAs a free man to do the things you're gonna do and that's what we have this opportunity American you're talking about the Democrats they're the ones that do you see what I was ... they can't afford a famous guy like that being a free man because if he is\nThe ... all that fear mongering slowly start to ... and we're already seeing a bit of that in the in the like I said with the the the portion of the African American community the Trump and caring he's he he carries far more African Americans vote than they thought he was doing too and he's only picked up steam because as you mentioned\nWe don't have lunch counters anymore there's no segregate the only segregation we are now working people segregate themselves in fact we really were integrated you can possibly get\nA so the reality is these old term they use and that fear tactics not only do they use the third act is just like you said every time an election comes around the also do it throughout the term Jim Crow when it comes to voter ID laws and still trying to convince people that African Americans aren't smart enough to get their own IDs\nThese people and and I think that's a big reason why we've seen them have that strong hold on the African American vote but they're losing that grip which means they will only go more crazy much like they are with the violent rhetoric we're getting from these crazy leftist when it comes to\nHillary or or a Eric Holder or Maxine Waters those crazy they're losing control of power because it is all about power believe it or not it's not it's not really just about race it's about power\nAnd they control the African American vote they're losing that control arrow\nThanks to people like yourself you're leading the way you were changed in another because you're voting conservative Republican it's because you're making up your own mind and not\nLetting them do it for you and they lose their mind over I think there was a car any hang out we'll get you on the other side of the break you're listening to the voice of Texas A M seven hundred came to me I'm ... if you want to join us to do a one size five eight ...
