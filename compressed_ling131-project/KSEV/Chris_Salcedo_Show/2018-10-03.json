yesterday\nThat jump people are getting fired up on the Republican side the conservatives and they're going to get out and vote we've seen the polls that were supposedly just\n... miles apart of all of a sudden tightened up real close for the midterms coming up we'll get into that more or less you wouldn't go to the phones one take one more call before we have to give them a Christian a few minutes let's pick up was Tom listening in Pasadena Hey Tom thanks for holding welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey thanks for taking it hey I'm I talked to last week that the Senate was supposed to I think they call it a pulse check at the end of the week kind of get an idea or the senators kinda would if they were going to do it but where they would land and I didn't hear anything about that that ... that that might happen\nOr you will be talking about for the the cabinet confirmation yes exactly\nOh they did a little pulse testing and looked like he was going to be confirmed and then Jeff Flake\nA cornered in the back room with a bunch of Democrats and apparently God Knows who\nAnd then he backed off and said I'd like this this week to go back and look at things and then they weren't sure and some people believe he may be running cover for a couple of all the other senators so that or you know maybe some of the the swing states so they weren't sure but it looked like it's really close regardless I don't know\nIf they get maybe one Democrat or two to vote for him it will be almost a miracle at this point\nYou know it looks like it's going to be right down party lines and we'll see and now they don't necessarily have to have you know I'm just like but if you lose Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and those kind of people then all of a sudden he may not make it so it it's fairly close I don't I'm not sure I wouldn't even\nAt this point I wouldn't even venture a guess as to as to how this thing's going to go down but it looks like they're going to vote and I would be willing to bet here in the next couple of days friday or Saturday\nSo um my gut tells me that the FBI or gets the additional FBI investigations not going to find much and so you really think that's going to sway any Democrats\nAt all but I think they're all just sit in the head about how they want this whole thing to fall and\nIt doesn't matter if they're if there was an FBI investigation at all just at all it's just I was listening to that I Can't remember who it was this morning on TV but there was a senator that was being pressed about it and he had already said that you already made up his mind about that he wasn't going to vote\nFor probably ... or even a charming\nYeah might've effect it was and the thing that just kind of blows me away is is that then what's the point of us even having this invest that just do investigation if there isn't that the whole purpose of it was to validate or maybe the sways the minds and those kind of things to\nDo what you just said it that's a good point there I don't think it's going to make any difference to any of these Democrats it may unintentionally now that all these these you know quote victims stories are falling apart\nBut the reality was they were hoping for first most clearly don't tactic they were doing that\nIn the second of all was hoping they can find something about his drinking his throwing ice on someone if we can find anything something credible just to put enough down to get one or two Republicans to vote against well then they're they go there'll be finding they cannot get him confirmed and then hopefully they would pick up seats after the midterm and then they could ... them\nNo problem one last thought um I think we're seeing what will take place\nIn regards to the environment and the climate of politics if the Democrats control the house and the Senate we cannot this is what's gonna happen we're going to see it as a clown show and I'm just pleading with everybody out there that can hear this just\nYou need to vote sensibly about this that's all I got\nYeah thank you for the call Tom and I agree what you just said people need to be sensible they need to know what they're looking at\nAnd understand what's been going on what we're seeing from the Democratic party the combination of something for many many years but really the previous eight years in administration they ran\nThey want to do because the Obama administration wasn't going to do anything [noise] it's sort of\nWhether or not we're going to stop jury duty because that's his job where they were going to close docket since stop people from coming into the floodwaters have tried to come down down\nThe David far walks through the floodwater from here to have that judges house knocks on the door and says hey\nCan you please answer the phone and make a decision and thanks for David far we've got that decision in time to get the word out to stop people from coming all the way downtown for jury duty to stop people from coming all the way downtown the docket\nBecause we finally had affirmative answer and that's the difference right there between a Republican judge and an immigration judge\nWhat was going to do a a decent job on the fence but when push comes to shove when tragedy\nArises we had the Republican stepping up to the plate to make sure that justice kept going on after Harvey\nBeen a ... I think you smelled it up pretty clearly we're talking with Chris Daniel Harris county district a clerk\nHe's running for reelection in ... you you just pointed out just one simple case of the stark contrast that we have now between Democrats and Republicans coming up in these elections in November this goes from the top of the ballad only the mid term state senator or US Senator all the way down as he mentioned the down ballot that's why it's important\nI don't recall a time in history you know years ago thirty forty fifty years ago sometimes it was hard to tell someone was a Republican or Democrat\nIn this day and age it's almost impossible not to tell because of the stark contrast between the two parties and I know you're very conservative but we see those responses in emergency situations away their response of course the the different attacks and you can see how things are up on Capitol Hill but looking at the difference and and you pointed out\nThe one of the most important things first of all there's county district court has written by ... by the way I remember a great picture the interview on social media you pumping water out of one of the buildings downtown was pretty awesome picture so people want to go find that you can go look that up on\nA social media but one of the things you pointed out was the down down with a lot of people like you said there's process there's all kinds of stuff on the ballot people think about the big top racist Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke\nBut there's a whole lot more on their people really need to pay attention to those those lower rates is the smaller ones that aren't getting all the media coverage\nYeah I'll give you an example of what happened in two thousand sixteen you it's a wave of Democrats voting in Harris County they brought in a whole bunch of new judges most of which were not tried and true\nAnd at the end of the day like two thousand Seventy when they were polling amongst the Harris County bar association the Houston bar association by that's dominated by Democrats by the way by their own members mostly Democrats voting judging their own judges\nOnly one Democrat that got elected in two thousand sixteen receive high marks\nThe majority receipts piling we low remarks\nAnd these are attorneys Democrat attorneys that practice forty Democrat judges on a daily basis and they're telling you buy their own polling that these judges are worth a flip and it is a shame that they swept out really good Republican trade them out for these crappy Democrats\nAgain only one Democrat receive fiber larks and how it is important that\nYou do your research is important that you do your body and for the love of Pete make sure you vote all the way down the ballot because if you decide yeah I don't know these people on discuss they added that well that's a double vote for the Democrat shame on you when you can play on the how bad the judges are running the place after they get an office if they have to work at all\nAnd I think what's weird you talked about that wave that ruling and we're I remember a lot of it was on the tail end of the district attorney or with or was it a Devon Anderson and then came on and she got in and we had all this so rose the money that they talked about five hundred thousand dollars of George Soros\nAccording to this local little Harris County district attorney race will now Kim all the Democrat won and like you mentioned all these other Democrats and you don't think that sort of thing is happening right now look at the money that Beto O'Rourke is pulling from California and New York and all over the place in the Ted Cruz race\nIt shows like just another example of why it's so important that is not the only place that it's happening\nBut that's another ... was a Senator Ted Cruz they're trying to unseat him with the Democratic adage completely unproven input and have\nMore polar opposites beliefs are very quickly last minute or so of course we're talking with Chris Daniel Harris county district court I'll tell her body why they should support you and your your opposition in this race\nWell our position in this race is not an attorney is not set foot in the courthouse anytime see other than to tour it so that you can find out where the front door as at least and or at the end of the day if you want somebody who is going to have to learn everything all over\nIf you want somebody that's going to have to start from the bottom up\nThe great go with the thought of it but if you want somebody that's tried and true that's been pushing technology that's been revolutionizing the thought that that might words your ah the ah worked with my fellow colleagues across the state district clerks and county clerks one of the best operated district courts offices in the history of Texas a modern times\nWere running the largest judicial system that they say that that was over half of the filing for the state of Texas in

I think the Republicans may have played it just right this is simply my assessment\nBut they none of them attacked her of course they had a female questioning her they were very handled their with kid gloves you sound like a seven year old girl\nThe way she spoke the way she act that you didn't sound like a PHD professor\nIn psychology\nNonetheless the she was handled with kid gloves by ms Mitchell and then\nThe Democrats when they question they talked about how much of a hero she was over and over and over again all are uncorroborated allegations and then we saw the way they went when Mr Kevin came in and the Democrats attacked him over and over and over showed him no respect they kept telling her doctor Ford and they didn't call him judge Kavanaugh\nThey attacked him over and over which caused some of the Republicans to lash out of course back in the Democrats and then they got the traditional week\nThey're using trauma Eric roll them think maybe they may have known some things and talked to some people because there were some hints that would lead me to believe that you know they've already investigated the FBI investigated Kavanaugh six times so there was already an investigation since the allegations came out maybe they had already talked to some people\n[noise] I don't know but nonetheless you've got Republicans now [noise] guys like\nMitch McConnell to be very new mouth when you get people like Lindsey Graham who now are just hawkish of the hawk they're fighting back Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell issued a stern message to protesters opposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and there's a very fiery Senate for speech\nOpposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and there's a very fiery Senate for speech earlier today\nHe said you were intimidation tactics will not stop the full Senate from voting on the judges confirmation\nHe's up there is no ...

[noise]\nI we don't want to ever get in a situation where because we see it happen sometimes witnesses or intimidated people that have been abused and they get abused the we get it and I I don't know you miss Ford was actually abused we don't know we just know that everyone she said that corroborate her story said no absolutely not\nWe don't remember anything like that her best friend said she'd never met Kavanaugh her story doesn't add up it just over and over and over again\nShe she almost got raped and then ran out and left that friend at a party that the woman says she doesn't ever remember being at with someone who just tried to rape her that's a good call and then you've got the more on like a allegations by that third woman\nA sweat Nick or whatever name was she saying the gang raped the gang raped and then she well she backed offers when she her comments when she was\nOn NBC what's happening is now they're starting to hold their feet to the fire listen there's this there's serious allegations are you willing to go under oath okay now you're willing to be under the threat of perjuring yourself well\n\nI think what may be happening is we may be seeing\nRepublicans galvanizing around these people and we've talked about it and I'm tired of talking about it\nI mean I'm I'm done with this issue but the reality is we're going to hear more and more stuff and then you've got people like the caller referenced are living was was uh Tom I don't remember who was who called earlier who said you know you had the Democrat who said doesn't matter the guilty or not I'm not voting for him\nBut then what's this all about the dog and pony show we're going to try to do whatever we can to get more dirt on him and delayed delayed delay the only want to do is the way let's kicking back packed them in terms if they can do that and pick up a few seats\nThat's it\nDonald Trump will not nominate old and a phrase that he will not get another Supreme Court justice confirmed guaranteed if they get in and they will bring articles of impeachment and do everything they can to impeach him they want to stop him he is they're nightmare\nYesterday the times published a story ... gauge in suspect tax schemes as he reach riches from his father in which he claims to have obtained confidential tax records that Trump committed outright fraud\nSaid that President Trump or participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including instances from parents\nAn investigation by the New York times has found but the times investigation based on a vast trove of combination of tax returns and financial records revealed that Mr Trump received the equivalent today noticed the term the equivalent today have at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's estate empire\nWhich started when he was a toddler continuing to this day\nWhile the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and review a little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad dozens of corporate partnership and Trump's tax returns off the first public accounting of the income he received from decades of varies family enterprises\nIn the story links statements from Charles Jay harder a lawyer for President Trump declaring stories allegations are one hundred percent sauce and highly defamatory based on extremely inaccurate claims\nHarder wars of the times allegations expose it to substantial liability and damages for defamation\nStayed there for the times from Mr harder\nOr goes as such the New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion are one hundred percent false and highly defamatory there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate\nAll a state matters were handled by license attorneys license CPAs and license real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly all matters were filed with the IRS and New York taxing authorities\nThe returns in tax positions at the times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities\nTo taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments which were made and then fully approved older tax filings these matters are now been closed for more than a decade but that's not going to stop New York's the lines will it's\nPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters the affairs will handle but other Trump family members\nWho are not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure a full compliance with the law should the time state or implied that President Trump participated in fraud tax evasion or any other crime it will be exposing itself is a substantial liability and damages\nFor defamation this is the same Mr harder who won a multimillion dollar settlement and obtained a full retraction an apology for the first lady Melania Trump\nAnd they live election against the daily mail\nWall Street journal reports the publication pay the first lady millennia Trump two point nine million dollars to settle a lawsuit\nOnce again this is how these people they don't care\nThey throw it out there though run with it for two or three weeks in very a correction on page Seventeen digital page Seventeen if at all because usually people won't go this far Donald Trump has the ability to go this far and that's something they just\nThey just I I you know at this point you would think they would get as well but they don't care these are left
