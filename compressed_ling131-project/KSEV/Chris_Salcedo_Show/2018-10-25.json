through Thursday\nOn the voice four to six PM which is warm you up for the amigos do take over on Fridays I'm forty six so you guys get geared up over the next two hours bringing you a gift beyond price that is almost three ladies and gentleman we bring you the spirit of talk radio we got a lot to cover their more suspicious packages sent out\nWe discussed this yesterday and we kept a serious we didn't play around we were joking because there's not joking manner\nNow there's a lot of jokes on social media and other people joke about a lot of stuff\nBut the good thing is no one has been hurt or killed so far one of these whatever they are being sent out these suspicious packages now a couple of more have been sent to Delaware and a male facility for address the former vice president Joe Biden\nOr contain similar explosive looking devices than to these other leading Democrat Party figures yesterday also according to uh\nThan to these other leading Democrat Party figures yesterday also according to the New York city police bomb squad they've recovered suspicious package addressed Robert De Niro and as I mentioned before fortunately none of these have detonated no one has been hurts and nobody has been injured\nIt's awfully suspicious timing I was seeing that yesterday on the program we have no idea for those that hurts somebody calls later in the show I start off the show by saying look\nWe have no idea what I'm sending these right now we don't maybe somebody else does but I have no idea we get very limited information you go on\nThis could be some crazy limited on the far right and this could be a ploy by the left to try to garner sympathy in a midterm election to try to manipulate votes I wouldn't put anything past the Democrats especially considering all of them and the media\nThey've already come out blaming Donald Trump Maxine Waters just come out and said he needs to accept responsibility for this or\nWhy\nShe also said that she is not to get well she said I Am scared after being targeted by a couple of packages are self contained what looked like pipe bombs chooses we have to keep doing what we're doing in order to make this country right that's what I intend to do and as the young people say I ain't scared\nAnd she called on President Trump to take responsibility for the kind of violence that what you're seeing for the first time in different ways\n[noise] you know what else I don't like people going around race baiting and calling somebody evil and bought and that's what they've been doing Maxine Waters says she scared\nShe was started by a couple of these you know we have to keep doing what we're doing in order to make this country right she said that's what I intend to do and as the young people say I ain't scared she called on President Trump to take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're seeing for the first time in different ways\nYes this is the very same Maxine Waters have played the audio intellectual politically I'm going to play 'em well you can call it a montage if you will and if you want to join us we're going to go through the rhetoric that we've been hearing from the left because they're all about peace and to remember when they were about tolerance in progress\nDo they seem very tolerant and progress these days\nAnd then\nWhen\nSurfaces that map of the United states there's all that ran in the middle where Trump won I win the host Hillary Illinois all kinds of like what\nThe map doesn't show you as a show you the one the places that represent two thirds of Americans gross domestic product oh okay so I Want\nPlaces that optimistic reverse dynamic moving forward for him and his whole campaign make America great again with looking backwards\nYou know you didn't like black people getting rights you don't like women you know getting jobs you don't want it you know the that Indian American seeding is is that ruined than you are wondering is that ... here's the rub your problem is I'm going to solve that\nThe last year so there you go so everything down from his races sexes massage and and then she went on to say let's go get\nA lot of trouble with the political party that wants to try what you stand for what you care about is not on a date in the end of this country\nIf we are forced\nTo run around the house armed on foreign really kind of sorry [noise]\nAll\nFriends that point I didn't make\nIt all that\nSo once again you've got all of it and then and then there's the new voice this guy right here in the new voice of the Democratic [noise]\nHe's got these people running around tearing up political signs you've got to preaching violence and civility and if they can't be civil until they take back over control and then I Know it could be just clearly\nIt back over control and then I Know it could be just clearly odd timing I mean it could just be I just happen to work out that some weird guy on the far right and sided I'm going to send a bunch of pipe bombs to a bunch of Democrats\nLess than two weeks before a midterm election where the Democrats aren't doing quite as well as they saw it it doesn't seem to be the big blue way they were looking for now fortunately no one was killed no one was injured none of these bombs went off\nBut\nThe interesting thing is Maxine Waters says Trump asked to take responsibility for this kind of violence everybody what\nWhat\nWas the first time we're seeing this in different ways now there's been mom sent in our country before it happened in Austin last year they killed three four people were killed in these bombs\nAnd has got blew himself up in a car\nClearly he was a more competent bomber if you will if that was the actual intent of these bombs used to kill people that got killed people and he was a horrible monsters a former military guy clearly had some issues and murdered people and blew himself up when they called him the good thing was they did catch them they got to him now terrible people died ahead of time\nGives me say that the entire\nArm of the federal government should be able to catch who's ever doing this sending these\nBut potentially expose most of the packages but remember this is what we've seen for at least the last two years with this this harsh rhetoric\nThere's no stability on the let me get an ... attacking people in the streets you had black lives matter attacking cops under the Obama administration and then you get one thing after another you get all ... Eric older when they go low will kick him\nYet now that you've got all the Democrats blending Trump and that includes their cohorts in the media like Jeff Zucker over CNN and Sarah Sanders had to respond saying you can't don't blame the president he's the only one that came out and said no this is unacceptable anytime anywhere\nSuing one five eight ... if you want to join us to a one size five eight five seven three eight let's go to Jim listening in Katy Jim thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of taxes\nHey lay I'm good how are you Jim\nI'm raising my thing it go and fight Democrat\nWell you know it's it seems like seems like that it is as a possibility but at this point we don't have enough information to know exactly where they're from or who sent them but the timing and the fact that nothing went off and no one was hurt which thank God for it I'm Glad no one was hurt but the timing seems awfully suspect doesn't it\nMake you know what ... what did they get out get Robin\nWilliams I think there's ... it was his restaurant it's not hard to get these addresses I can find them in ten minutes on line\nSo that's not difficult to do getting the information these are public figures in it is pretty easy to go find\nPeople if you really want to look that being said it boils down to as you mentioned no one was hurt none of these went off deck needs to be a really good thing or that could have been by design we don't know it's way too early but man\nTwo weeks leading into a mid term what a way to garner sympathies have you been painting Republicans as in a phobic rapist massage units to horrible violent people enabled me civil until they garnered power\nOnce again I just like the you know making that up I I like common sense I'm weird like that to a one size five eight five seven or eight thanks for the call Jim to a one size five eight KFC me let's go to John living in Houston and Jon thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas yeah\nYeah and I could have gone up box or just for\nA way to try and kill me for his thoughts on a balmy but he has a radio program and so he can have a quick a sort of officers are about\n... thoughts of about twenty five in color somebody talk on the radio program\nAnd um [noise] the call and and the bottom line was that there was a lot of this district Raasch\nMound at twenty five callers on the edge bombs and what was surprising to me was a remarks may bar yeah Brian kill me and to our co host was speaking at\nA in terms of\nIt was like news to them that the caller's his truck is trust in the\nMedia what we're doing me into wind a media well let's go ahead\nAnd you know and I'm thinking to myself well you know if we can't see it\nYou know different variables you know like for example I'm no surveying landscape she won dropping bombs on there were you cannot go through the mail\nThat don't\nPunch stitch a stance on\nSome sort of well hold on hold on John and thank you really call there was something that I saw with postage stamp on them but it didn't look like they had been received my post office or stamped on top of the ah the mailing stance that being said who at this point we haven't seen\nAny video people dropping them off the reality is somebody dropped him off probably somewhere there is going to be video whether we see it or not remains to be seen and at one point my thought it'd be it's probably some courier somebody sent to do the package so but nonetheless there is going to be there's going to be evidence ... [noise]\nHurt themselves will it will clearly if they're sending them to themselves they don't want to hurt themselves that makes perfect ends up being that I\nI I Believe it's probably one or two or three people I only gets all of these people individually sending them to themselves I think there's some group sending them to a targeted set of people for a targeted reason and we just don't know what that is just yet\nBut you know ... and then I'm going to tell you there because I'm a ... really the Web ale easily it had to go any more of a search term all of what's going on with all of this that there is a fight between good and evil I mean I don't you feel that way\nWhen they'll tell you there's there's always a fighting going on between good and evil whether you get any worse now exploded you're seeing it now and in many ways it is worse now but that being thank you for the call we appreciate it\nUm in in many ways you're using and now we've got twenty four hour news twenty four hour Internet we have to talk of social media we're barrage do with it and the bad news is what sticks it's the old adage if you get bad service at a restaurant you'll tell seven out of ten people if you get good service in a restaurant you'll tell three out of ten people [noise]\nIt's weird but that's how it is so to go back now is this you know we've had mad bombers the Unabomber thinking about that yeah that was to terrorize people where there's Newton Austin to terrorize people\nThese are terrorist acts at least from all accounts it looked like a terrorist act it watching the response of the Democrats Hillary Clinton having immediately having a press conference all the Democrats blaming Trump\nHe looks coordinated their answers are coordinated this is simply reinforcing the crazy violent rhetoric they've been trying to push for the last two years to offset and go to ... they're\nClearly that's their answers whatever the reasoning is from for whomever send these bombs we don't know yet but we can look at the Democrats and see what they've been doing and what they've been saying\nThe mere fact that made called out in and Maxine Waters to the president has to take responsibility for this he's condemned all violence on any ties repeatedly but the lame stream media the fake news CNN and Jeff Zucker hate that message they don't want to say that they want him to be a monster\n[noise] so what happens is we can't seems worse ...\nWe're lucky we I mean honestly as bad as we got it we got it better than everywhere else ... pockets of amazing profitability and we've success and economic prowess we live in a great place here in America there's still bad things but it is just kind of stuff like this\nIs William worse than other countries and it's ... ... we don't even want to go into how bad certain things are in other places\nBut it does lead over we still have it\nContrary to popular belief no matter how great your society and there's always going to be bad people there's always going to be insane people and unfortunately sometimes there one in the same and they tend to get all the headlines so it seems like it's worse I don't think there's any worse I think things are better now than they used to be\nMuch in many cases what when you look at CNN or watch the news and watch all the media string the president absolutely they're worse than their rhetoric than they've ever been in our lifetime thank you for the call to a one size five eight K.

I was listening to something or reading I Can't remember and I know this from a previous experience the FBI is very tight lipped they don't want to do anything generally when they're investigating something unless of course there [laughter]\nTry to participate in a soft coup I'm Donald Trump they generally are very quiet and they don't say a lot and I keep the the the cards close to the vest when it comes to investigations asked about taking the investigation or to uh to allow other things happen especially deal with bombs and\nThings such as this so they may be closing in on at least a location where they're coming from\nI Hope they find out who did it very quickly could take a very long time we have no idea\nUh Matt Maxine Waters came out that gene scared because that's what the kids are saying and that President Trump should take responsibility for this kind of violence\nSo Trump needs to go and it meant that it's his fault Jeff Zucker says the same thing the Democrats and the media all blaming it all on Trump and he responded by saying\nA very big part of the anger we see in our society today is caused by\nA very big part of the anger we see in our society today is caused\nBy the purpose fully falls in at inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media than he refers to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful did his beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast\nDo you agree with the president's statement\nTo aid won five five eight Casey bean stew lead one five five eight five seven reader is anyone shocked that the Democrats are blaming Donald Trump and anyone who supports them for this kind of action\nI mean clearly they blamed Bernie Sanders when the crazy Bernie Sanders supporters well the one guy shot speech delays wanted for others before he was killed by security or another when stabbed or was it killed two people in stabbed another move or they clearly blamed Bernie ... oh no he didn't\n\nThat you're ready for Halloween early like it Gary [noise] you're you're ready for Halloween [laughter]\nYou're you know this year are you going to actually wait and have some of the candy for the kids instead of eating it offers this year oh is that how that works well that goes to work\n[laughter] welcome back to aim seven hundred K. U. T. V. the voids objections on Christmas ... ... the mother ship and you're getting your line of if you want to comment we're talking about well the medium the media has blamed Donald Trump these pipe bombs\nHe gets CNN's president Jeff Zucker saying the president and especially the White House press secretary\nShould understand their words matter just for the show no comprehension of that\nComing from CNN president Jeffrey Zucker the guy who hires [noise]\nReporters certain guys by the name of Jim Acosta who said when using nationalist you mean white nationalist a guy who's tried to pay the president in every way but fake news believe me you guys think news completely\nCNN is garbage now you know what garbage look who's running it\nTwo one five eight ... if you want to join us to read one five five eight five seven three eight and then you've got this on MSNBC and ... we've talked about this at ... pm the entire left wing of the Democratic party well it's the media\nThere the propaganda arm for the Democratic party they're all Democrats they donate Ninety percent of the Democratic party and they made it very clear that Trump is not their president well they'll cover 'em and try to destroy him at every opportunity\nIs amazing that they never talk about how Hillary Clinton said well you know we can't be civil until we get power back how they don't go off on Maxine Waters their words do matter writes Eric Holder\nThey can say whatever they want a President Obama they bring a knife would bring a gun you know by the way very quickly to see that a Chuck Grassley called for an investigation into 'em well Mr ... and the third accuser Mr cab novel and they said he was ... gang rapes because\nClearly it was a ... one hundred percent manufactured story was manufactured lies yeah anyway I just want to mention that so that earlier uh once again if you want to join us we're talking about what's going on with the what's this this rhetoric harsh rhetoric\n\nIs for instance fault was Bernie Sanders fault that crazy guy went and shot Steve college than for others and tried to kill them just Republicans practicing for I don't think they have the same things you said back then to add one five five a case to be let's go to auto who's been patiently holding auto thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey guys you know you're saying that anybody that those people and then by all this is the group and I do agree with you on both sides\nUm if you do know environments you're being a hypocrite you know normal drawn out their statements like nope the crap out of you you I promise you win a legal fees I beat\nThe crap out of you if you lose some of the family court don't worry about it I like the point you in the face I mean I can go on and on and on and all\nYeah you know you know he went back to hold on hold on last night or auto hold on the auto hold on\nYou do know he came back and he said absolutely apologize to those statements you said it wasn't right and he doesn't condemn violence on anyone you do know he said that right\nYes and I I was so surprised and I would not agree on who will tell you\nThe only that many times a week that understand you know that we can agree to disagree I mean I don't like drunk like John I'm going to follow your home and you you\nI'm with you we we we are\nOh man you you know I'm with you\nWe we we are we're we're all ... ... vote on on our choice is to go vote\nWell in in your ... and all those\nAre all first of all you're absolutely right you're absolutely right I agree with you were supposed to respect and whether you and I agree on something when we're done I Want to shake hands and be friends and because this is America and this is this is we're supposed to be a better place\nBut the problem was going back to that ... ... you know perspective is important and we talked about Donald Trump said\nHe said when that when that was happening there was a paid agitator in one of his rallies punch that guy in the mouth he absolutely said he has to pay their bills and then somebody did it he immediately did at one eighty with no no no I didn't really mean that don't punch anyone don't attack anyone don't do this I condemn violence\nHe absolutely did that the point I'm making is let's go back to Hillary Clinton\nHe said we can't have civility until they're back in charge has Maxine Waters backed off and never statements encouraging mobs of people to go around people and tell them they're not welcome in this country anytime anywhere\nAs Eric Holder condemned his statements\nWe're not seeing any condemnation from one particular side which leads to the problem which you just said it's going to be very difficult to go and get along with somebody who believes that well it's okay to get groups of people to follow you home and shouted you in a in a in a mob that's dangerous I Do you agree\nUh I agree with you partially true you know the damage is going on here is not true you can go on to watch you know Google in a saying drunk inciting violence is over and over and over eating some idiot also sent bones you know it's just you\nKnow ... what you're saying you hate cooking clearly if my Sanders ... what you're saying is clearly was Bernie Sanders fault that guy tried to murder those Republicans in them they're killed these ... his fault\nNo no because he never said I normally crop battery am I like the ... in the face a you know forget about grabbing women by that but I Know you put a leash he's like like Norman ... pottery and with you I promise you an\nAuto I've just told you he already he went back in the winter\nI told you he went back in condemned those statements that not count do you not believing apologies in other words nothing he you want to know why people can't get along lotto\nYou just proved it thank you for the call you just proved that no matter what Donald Trump says or does\nHe made a mistake it doesn't matter he's evil he's wrong and there's nothing fixing it you didn't say one word about Hillary Clinton you didn't say one word about Maxine Waters you didn't say one word about any of these other people you want to know why people get ill all NATO that is the reason why\nYou can't call in my program expecting you to bend over and just let you say what you want factual or not I have already gone over on this program absolutely Donald Trump said that immediately resent that didn't say my God I'm Sorry I don't do this and he said it every other rally\nAfterwards in fact we learned later that the Democratic party was paying those people to not only your tax Trump supporters to commit violence at these rallies\nYou want to know because it it happened previously over and over and over again at his rallies\nSo he responded because he wasn't prepared wrong it was and he immediately admitted it Hillary Clinton has never admitted that it's wrong to say you can't be civil was someone to we're back in charge there totalitarian it is their political ideology\nThat is why we have the problem auto you seemed like a really nice guy but clearly you were one sided you can't get along with Donald Trump I talked about the statement he made over twelve years ago rabbit women ...\nWhat was pulled on a hot that he didn't know he was being recorded and he never said that he did it he said that if you're rich women will let you do anything\nContacts to important he should grab you by to\nAbsolutely he said it you know what else he did when it came out he apologized said it was wrong he was locker room talk and he was doing goofy stuff than guys do he was in front of a crowd and he was performing\nBut it's okay to the others that when they go do it\nWell no they don't even have to say there's sorry salt Trump's fault this is the narrative the media wants you to believe auto that's why and I've done is more research clearly then you have let's go to Rob who's been hanging out a long time Rob banks were hanging out and walk into the voice in taxes\nOr really loves\nCover up through right next to a lesser was as\nIf there was a siren ram applies to the first country they enter sort of for if they're from America to Mexico where are those should be returned to Mexico because that's the courtroom was supposed to provide the asylum am I right\nUm I think technically you're right but Rob unfortunately these people don't follow laws otherwise they would go to the U.S embassy or they would go to the the border where you the the station at the border where you apply for asylum but no they don't care if they're wanting to come directly and they don't care about laws laws don't matter you're absolutely right in front of\nUs are required to lose people\nKnow there is no law that requires them to bring people and that is false from the news the fake news if you will\nTurn around and say last or our border\nPatrol does it every single day in our country to the tune of salads and [noise] we can send the military to our border and we can say guess what you're trying to invade our country you are not welcome here you're not applying for asylum that you want to apply for asylum set right on over there at the station and they'll talk to you and you can go do that\nMay I Want you to Wade Davis the point you made or not only valid you're absolutely right the media likes to get people whipped up to get some ratings and then make some money and they don't care about you where I Am in a lot of politicians on both sides of the aisle\nThe you're right they're leaders in fact the vast majority of them are and they don't care about you or are they claim to care which is why they run for office and they want that power and they're going to help us but it seems like many of them just go and get elected and then and then go right back to doing what they do is just helping themselves and that we\nGet into government and they get paid and money and they get a cost of living raise every single year they get fantastic healthcare law wouldn't want to you know I Want to apply for that job\nAnd you see why so many of them for the call David you see why so many of them run and why they do it there are some good ones Rand Paul is a good one he's a great one I don't even agree with everything rambling sentence do look at a Ted Cruz he is a great when they painted him out to be loose for in his own party told them that\nJohn Maynard did in the media hate Ted Cruz who looked at that man's record what he's done\nTo look at the he actually cares about what are you doing and what he says and does what his electorate voted for him to do but you're right the media hate them when the media is dominated by leftist and you're right there are people in the right they attacked Obama in a very similar fashion the media didn't\nBut the people there were people in the right to do some of it was worth it just like some of it's warranted on Trump but the reality is you're right these people don't care about you many of them are leaders especially in the media the media are the worst elitist among them the television crowd oh you ought to see the way the television crowd treats the radio people's hilarious\nNot all of them but many of them on the left they really do and it's unfortunately you can paint a lot of my political colors\nAnd it's sad but that's where we are and we see a twenty four hours a day seven days a week on to on twenty four hour news channels and on social media thing for the call appreciate it let's go to Judy Judy thinks we're hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThank you love your show of course I'm you know I I guess to me it's so obvious when you look back at the election when Hillary Clinton lost she was thoroughly thoroughly upset about it and\nI I noticed all of this name calling and you know other back and forth and all the ... trend hate and and all of that really started I mean in my eye it looks like they're really bad laser\nWill and Judy Jose unless you're finished but you're absolutely right because the rhetoric went up about twelve nachos and when she lost [laughter] because it was it was supposed to be rigged in her favor and she lost\nShe couldn't even speak to the people that showed up for her that night and then go back and then what happened she became the leader of quote the resistance their term not hers she's gone in told President Trump or racist whatever instead of conceding\nA nice thing quite leaned going away like you're supposed to know that's not what she did she's the leader of the resistance and that rhetoric trickled down from the top as they say and so you're absolutely right it went up twelve nachos and it hasn't come down to its own that have gotten worse\nYou know another thing I wanted to point out in my opinion as well is that\nYou know try anything or what I Would call a real man look when you make a mistake you let's say something or you you said it wrong you know it it it even has the um character ah within yourself that you can say hey I made a mistake you know that speaks volumes to me\nIt really don't I Wish people would just okay let as far as I'm concerned nobody's listening to them\nI mean they look like they're twelve years old\nYou know and they're having a fit and the store 'cause their model what lines and candy\nAnd things that are ... ... your Judy thank you for the call you're you're absolutely right they're acting like pet you with children\nBut the problem is there are people that tend to agree with them already absolutely will go ride along with them because they feel just a slight Hillary Clinton was supposed to be our president I played the audio thousand times no reason I'm not going to play right now she's got a bunch of calls when they get through\nBut they they ... everyone in the media thought there's no way this guy's going to win and then he won and they can't handle it they can't accept it so they're trying to do everything they can undermine him to cut his legs out from under him and then impeach him they've sent it they mean it let's go to Marie in Houston Murray thanks for hanging on welcome to the motion Texas\nI find that to say thank you because I found that you had on was talking about how the people treat it like what it was thought to have a life of Paul Ryan and all the others and I just kept saying he's right he's right is right now I don't know he was but he made my day\nI think it was was it will I think it was really there called ... no no not really it was paying me sorry\nOkay probably ... ... children\nTaught anywhere from cancer that they are they don't even know squat\nHillary as background when push filed gauge track okay just respect thinking what Harry when president President was running for office and that was scandals and now she has on a fan of ... now that people can provide\nMarie you're not allowed to talk about email gate with everything going on the show him nine AM to Russia and you're just part of the vast right wing conspiracy\nClearly that they give us a call Murray by the way for those who didn't know what I was just talking about yeah those were three other things out on top of what she said she's dead on let's go to one more call in before we go to the break a theory let's go to John listening in the women's John thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThank you for doing a great job of a burning all the facts chores like you know as I think about this bond issue for me the fact that no one has a flow it gives us one very plausible explanation\nIs a extreme ... test\nWho has run out of things to run it you know a scream at the a caravan et cetera et cetera so let's create another thing that oil or look bad on the\nConservative let me sent from bombs\nFor the people who are most hated or are the most hated the\nArc users of President Trump but let me make sure that these things are drawn to explode so you know they should not one that er an average floated it seems to me like they were never intended to explode and only just started spectacle that kind of got pushed back on the conservative\nYou know for the call John you may be right I mean we don't know at this point is still too early to tell that wouldn't surprise me one bit it wouldn't surprise me if we did some for right now the job of that is not in his right hand sending what he thought was bombs to people the fact\nThis came out less than two weeks before the midterms while the early voting is going on the fact that not one of them exploded which is a good thing that we're going to find out other real bombs are probably not we're going to find out some of like the real from what I'm hearing\nBut the fact that no one's voted no one got killed at this point it's just too early to make that call the ... when you start adding\nBill ... at this point it's just too early to make that call but what when you start adding things up especially looking\nAt the history of the last two three years [noise]\nThat's a very plausible a situation that it's a very plausible
