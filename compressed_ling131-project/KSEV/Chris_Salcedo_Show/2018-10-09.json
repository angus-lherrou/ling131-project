Peter Struck and Lisa Page she laugh he was fired\nGot Andrew McCabe I mean he goes on and on and on it's it's kinda crazy when you go through there and look at the um\nNow we know there's I think it was was at sixteen of them twelve fourteen I don't even remember the number but it was interesting they had all these African American females and all of them are talking about what made them decided to run for judge and they're doing this and this is a historic moment in our state and our city was happening and as the running hardly enough I Know of at least\nTwo judges that are African American one of them Melanie flowers I've spoken to in the past she wasn't included\nIn that report and you know what the other in fact all of the ones we talked to were liberal Democrats ...\nWhy were the other is left out of that story because there's no media bias okay and if you think there is then you're all crazy\nOr you're not because there is a media bias and there's a ton of it\nAnd I'm like this program where I Am supposed to go out and the balance my opinions on politics this is an opinion based program it's the talk show that does not news the problem is you get more accurate news from this program than you do from quote news programs you know why because I don't have an agenda yeah I my biases\nI Know what where I stand on the political aisle but I care about the truth the truth is important to me\nThe truth is important to all of us when truth no longer matters wasn't that bad time\nWe've seen that throughout history for those who don't study history\nBelieve me ... leave me it's really bad when the truth doesn't matter and I've been the one who came out and called up president before he's had issues with the truth when he was running on the campaign he had a lot of issues with the truth he's a salesman I Know what he does he was selling negative good bad fact didn't matter\nHe a Democrat and the Democrats and there's a reason why they hate him and they cover him so negatively argue back to the story\nThree hundred and eight minutes mostly negative Ninety four percent coverage of the Trump Administration immigration policy has administration from June to September\nThe networks attention to this topic has waned over the summer now with the evening broadcast only Smith two hundred and fifty minutes on immigration but that fell to just thirty five minutes in July Eighteen minutes in August and the mere five minutes in September and wonder why it drew oh that's right Kavanaugh\nCars there by the Reagan up in here ... kids out your husband's too 'cause cabin I'll be raping air body up in here\n\nAfter Brett Kavanaugh was announced the night of July the night from the networks that gave his nomination relatively little time from July the tents through September sixth the three evening newscasts together spending mirror thirty two minutes on the confirmation battle\nThat changed on September the thirteenth when the first anonymous allegations against Kavanaugh were revealed\nFrom then through the end of September the networks produced an additional two hundred and forty nine minutes of coverage centered on accusations of youthful sexual misconduct roughly eight times more than was devoted to the earlier debate about Kavanaugh's judicial record and philosophy over the last Thirty years\nThere's heavily continued through October leading up to the Senate approval uh well I guess up to October six\n\nAnd show the value of a percentage eighty to present negative about how President Trump and his team handled the cuts Kavanaugh's nomination what\nDid we ever did I miss the something there\nDid I miss the entire Democratic Party the way they happened to the way they operated\nI mean all those Democratic senators and the Judiciary Committee all the Democrats coming out all of the one thing they believed her old ones discounting the fact that there were absolutely no corroboration to her words in fact she either misspoke or flat outline multiple times\nNothing in care\nSo it was a hit piece is just stopping Trump the media ladies and gentlemen a part of the resistance by the way I mentioned my share that you're still has a job\nThere was another local reporter here you've probably heard or on the station in the past her name was scarlet for talk here's remember her on her personal Facebook page after the election she talked about how happy she was because the person she liked got elected she was terminated from her job\nFor her blatant politics\nAnd the other reporters and mine is not the only one I'm not singling around just she just came out there are many many others that I don't think she should lose your job over debts but he's I think you're allowed to have your opinions it just shouldn't be known\nStood up for trying something else lots of other word is not one of them has been fired over there are clear partisanship on the other side of the aisle and if you doubt what I'm saying go dig through their Twitter accounts real look\nHe that's their Twitter account they should be able to put whatever they want on there but don't parades yourself as a quote objective journalist whether or not I don't think for the most part my it as a good job of she can\nI think she drives very hard to do the best she can she ... she just screaming liberal scan out but it's all politics but she tries problem in they've expose themselves figuratively\nOn the latest with uh especially the immigration debate none of those those journalists very few of them could contain themselves I couldn't do it they could not contain their opinions which tells you exactly where they stand on the political spectrum\nIt goes with the others to it's\nThem not just Thirteen or ABC Thirteen not CBS not NBC it's all of them is the collective we've seen the movement in the Democratic party of totalitarianism of group take if you do not follow all the way we think you will be far did you see the TV reporter was it an anchor\nThat covered a Trump rally with a ... hat on and they fired him the next day\nLadies and gentleman there is a pure a double standard here and this is why we do this program this is why I cover these things\nBecause if I don't the only people that are covering it for us people that tend to you on that\nBecause if I don't the only people that are covering it for us people that tend to you on the conservative side because otherwise you would have no idea the one thing and something else [noise]\nJust like the way they covered Kavanaugh\nAll

if you want to know the real reason why Kavanaugh was really getting destroyed is because there's going to be a lot of indictment that are going to come down on very powerful people I think\nAnd if you look at the video of Lindsey Graham talking about military tribunals and the fact that this country is still considered at the state or at a state of war then uh nine eleven three days after nine eleven Congress gave the president the authority to declare war\nAnd right now if you look at some of these executive orders that have been put in place by Trump is setting up or the Iraq and diet man or the folks that are at the ... that are doing all these illegal markets this\nThing and I'm Sorry no question about five thousand ... year old and I\nDon't think I've heard you know the only one I've heard this from I've heard this from other people there's a whole lot supposedly coming are you referring to mainly people like deterring Congress that kinda stuff are you talking about something far more expensive than just that\nUh it would it would include people and in Congress or the CEOs or if you look at some of the larger companies or you're going to\nThey're referring to the shows um it got the folks at the FBI the OJ and you can also see a lot of the uh the kind of ties into the George Soros funding to and all the corruption that you're seeing\nA within our to our with all of our department though\nIf you look at the projects vary a video that this recently came out you'll see there's a lot of people with inside these agencies that are still left over from the previous administration edited then they're not caring and they're they're part of group a five oh one C.\nThree or five on before that they have to declare a hundred pounds of perjury and they're working on our tax dollars or these uh funded foundations and doing a side work for the socialist marks the foundation while they're in our department of\nDoing more and you'll ... you'll see those and he says the project\nBy the way I look pretty well so you were the second of all you're absolutely right on the project mirrored tiles for those checkout project during ... done or giving news is James of keys\nAnd those videos not only the people that as you mentioned the don't care but would you are but I think you ... to the fact that these people are actively in our government working against this administration promoting socialism there was a little socialist of America or whatever\nThey're absolutely doing that so I I don't know about all these indictments I've heard rumors I've seen some of the stuff coming along I don't know but at this point it wouldn't surprise me\nTrump is an outsider that came in and he's not one of their people and they don't like him and it's it's been weird watching some of these Republicans get on board well these Democrats\nThey are I don't know if they're terrified they hate them they lose a resistance they want to stop them thinking for the call out

immediately somebody you know ... and call me a Whitey and stuff like that now this is what you have to deal with\nIf you're in politics and the twenty first century\nBecause the moment the race card comes out\nYou know you won the argument\nYeah that's true and we we seen a lot of that first of all I'm Glad you did that thanks for doing that senator Betancourt we're talking pop it in court\nAnd

tactics\nAgainst kids on college campuses against adults will talk about the Portland video I'll get into that\nBut I I Want to make sure I get back to the phones here before too long\nYou're right it's a combination of both being unhinged and coordinated these people have lost and they're desperate and they're angry and they're mad and they're well funded\nOnce again I say this a lot I'm going to continue to say it what makes us think we're not going to have to fight just as hard as they are to maintain our republic\nWhen Franklin set right you've got to Republicans you can keep it\nYou're
