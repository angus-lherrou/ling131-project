underground and if he blames Trump than would've Hillary Booker and waters in holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for violent and I added further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left in the right I don't think Republicans should rise to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned when I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye was leaders would work to make things better not words and said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that they

the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides no it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by a Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bad hell yeah let's denounced that all day long\nI don't understand the point look here's the thing you could sit here in March

totally fine with that go ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet speech you don't like it was more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who was um who\nWas who knew someone who knew the the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there [noise] um apparently and this was when I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the\nUm tiki torches people but to protect the counter protesters and not even because they agreed with him but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you had somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher wages horrible but it's like okay so Ann\n\nHow would that attributed to Trump\nAnd\nHow would that attributed to Trump [noise] yeah and furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever has condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa\nThey have refused to condemn the protests on college campuses where people ... people in the face and burned down buildings\nSo before you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people's consistency\n...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps match it\n\nBut yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media tell you that no\n\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed the KKK would have a TV towards rally in Charlottesville is anybody surprised at that don't believe me go Google at Washington Post write about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it they'll condemn it less and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it last because it was somebody of their own ideology that did it that organize it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what does that give you to say the ... that you're saying well right does it give it when\n\nThis is this idea that\nUh\nSome I mean this I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an

perceived the prestigious thirty under thirty award from any are and among his investment properties use one in the U.S Virgin Islands Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThank traveling exhibit a tragedy here\nWe're delighted you're hearing by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property\nLet's not not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nBack soon so Philips how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell when I bought my first investment property even I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo fill up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that\nA lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started I wasn't made my my first investment was an owner finance deal when I bought that land with just ... percent down and so I have a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine and I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even used responsibly financial products such as hard money alone can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest then they have no idea how to do it how you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd more of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started specially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean getting involved with the national association and committee such as he unprofessional network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places\nAnd just kind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me\nWinds by her first investment property she did not how\nAmazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars all and we were in for a total of eighty seven as she was able to turn that being a for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars\nMake him a doubt a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and so let me just mention getting a hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund the mortgage without the requirements than a major national bank would have so tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way\nTo accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing there's also portfolio I was but as far as hard money loans it's really just about networking and\nFinding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as\nHard money low individuals so we've got to the entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and it can help your clients\nFill up that it's such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years that\nThey're simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nWith the people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older\nNot too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nNo ice I Love that will fill up by really appreciate\nYou joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your tactics and your techniques for investing in real estate thank you thank
