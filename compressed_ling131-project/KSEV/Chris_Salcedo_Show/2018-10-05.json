to you I think the challenge that will do to believe professor Ford\nOkay so counter churn\nOkay we do not believe professor for there's not a woman I Know that believes there and it all started with it when she first open your mouth and focusing that creepy little childish voice and then she never answered that question in direct\nStraight answers and kitten nothing back them up and when I went back to my cell phone to review the video I watched her face and body language she is everywhere everything she says coming out of her mouth she was a liar\nOkay let me ask question sure did and in

around here do you have an entry for what the Brent special is\nI don't go to Mars but let me talk [laughter] let me say something\nAbout Rachel Mitchell she did an excellent job when I First Listen to her\nI was angry because I thought why she coddling this woman is left is\nLying warming up there trying to disrupt our whole Senate hearing and and believe me this was all concocted the whole story was concocted it wasn't true that is why she never tickets to the local police she hadn't she had no evidence yet nothing there was no case and that's why she never pursued it\nUntil she came out it's a very last\nMinute sharing you know I'm going to take the inside of that I don't I don't agree with you at all\nTo fall to salt and\nHanging out on a chair and we got we got a whole bunch of people so we got to run up good weekend and you gotta common yeah I I think\nGet everything that Dr Ford said was believable I think she believed it\nUm I think we the issue has more it's not so much about that any more about whether or not\nKavanaugh was the guy or get it or some such side are stacked similarly and that it ... it has become much more about whether or not\nOr someone can be convicted in the court of public opinion based on his soul uncorroborated allegation who's every witness has denied the event ever occurring and I would I sit here\nAnd say the doctor for he's a liar I Do not believe that she is alive and I really do I mean I'll watch the whole testimony I had some questions in my mind about how she portrayed herself with all the\nHippopotamus that's in the brain and the chemicals and all that you know it was a very clinical analysis she was giving and so I it but it was was not an issue of credibility in my mind I think she totally believed and testified honestly\nBut the country has moved on because now the country is going in a different direction and that's whether or not any body in a court or in school or in the workplace or in the Senate can get a fair shake\nOkay let's go to the phones and pick up Tony you're next on the voice of Texans come on Tony\nAwards anybody who's the most women on the job if you believe that warm in the lab and
