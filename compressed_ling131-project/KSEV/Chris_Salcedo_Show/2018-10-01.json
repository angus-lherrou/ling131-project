F. C.

we heard anybody like that around\nThe last time we heard anybody act like a land of the ground was John Ryan or the night before they voted on the order of all health care act and you got on on the podium there and are now and I I mean they did everything but cry you know and and it was too little too late\nAnd Lindsey Graham continued or tried to do that\nOr the other day a Harvard headed the Republicans have an opportunity to take advantage of this\nAnd not ... but I auditioned they're trying to make a statement and going up against a\nThey're using or going up ... it wasn't that are in a knife fight I don't know they're they have guys that or you're going to night and and the Republicans don't know how to fight that do not apply that to their fighting that are that are that the death and we're just wanting to get\nThe opportunity to say we need more than that when he when he fired like Trump won because he doesn't buy a statesman ... it's not an Indian hey\nAnd ah if they've had the opportunity to use what's happening right now and not use it and yet it dried vantage an election um their votes and I know there anyway but\nThey're you know well it's interesting because we're looking at it and I agree what you said from is definitely know statesmen that's one of the reasons he got elected as because we finally found somebody that will hit back in the Democrats as hard as they hit\n... and it sure does seem that way it seems like the Democrats showed up with guns and both barrels blazing the thing about it for a second imagine\nWe saw what happened last Thursday on the edge and what would happen if the Republicans would have went after Mr Christine Blasey Ford the way that the Democrats went after judge Kavanaugh can you imagine the outrage that would have happened\nNow attends I'll have to nominate than a mom I have a rubber stamp they were never looked at me he what what are they both women they were that is correct yeah\nYeah it was a rubber stamp bill not even not even at yet another on the other question an investigation and you know\nWho the point is making John was born I was making was your point with valid the Democrats showed up loaded for bear and they're ready to do this and they went in their job is to take down cabinet they're doing everything they they said that's what the Democrats have done now the Republicans they seem to woke up would Lindsey Graham and the others you know Senator Cruz and those people kind of\nFighting back now I'm hearing them\nBut it's a common saying they want to vote this week they don't even want to wait for the week to be out so\nThe reality is we're playing the political game and it's a close vote I Know the Republicans are trying to do what they can to make sure guys like flake or the people he's running cover for will continue will vote for Mr Kavanaugh so they can get this push through before the midterms not have to weigh nominate somebody else see what happens\nIt's gonna be interesting to see how this pans out is this going to hurt the Democrats that their approach in the midterms or is this going to help them um what do you think\nWell I Know that they talk a little bit about him he can't have it all it becomes a judge yeah you know later on so that they talk from Democrat so then you know these days or a Republican here that and they shot or\nNo I don't think they they're not going to be heard that\n... know they're not shuttering I have heard that and this is the same time they said about President Trump from the moment he was elected they talked about impeaching him and they've already tried to bring apartment to impeachment at least two times they will do it again after the midterms the\nDemocrats are going to be\nTalking here on the route but the guy was a big talker I'd like to see a little bit more than that you know when McCain won an olive Jay from Donald what did he do it said hell no\nYeah no that's no knowledge you know what biologist go we go and I actually I Am the or\nSomething in the back you know I Can't do anything but there was a little lamb\nHold on hold on you can do something that they give us a call John listening at magnolia appreciate it you can do something you can continue to vote already know how you're going to vote and you don't you're going to vote the right way just like I Am\nYours you're probably as angry as I Am and there's no way I Would have right now at this point when I stamp check mark next to me I'm not going to vote for Democrats they have shown from their side of the aisle to power above everything else now here's the thing\nMitch McConnell you're right he does talk a lot of these Republicans talked a lot I could not stand I could not stand Mr Mayor I hated speaker begging her he was a politically because he cried a lot he smoked a lot and you drink a lot many damn sure didn't do a lot to get conservative values pass through the uh through through Congress in fact you didn't have any\nHe did everything he could to get a ... the Obama stuff passed so we're talking about a nightmare what I Do like is this is this boils down to leadership Republicans haven't had a strong leader in quite some time since Mr Trump came along and that's when did you notice looking Lindsey Graham he was the lamb of all lambs and now look at that guy\nHe's screaming from the top of his lungs and everything he said last Thursday was correct\nAnd he's ... he's gonna be interesting to see what pans out but that leadership at the top makes a big difference and you know getting out and voting do we do have a say in this we do and the Republicans roll over and die you think that's going to help them in the midterms hell no we won't\nThey need to stand up and make it looks as if they wait till next week to confirm him that's fine we'll see maybe got at least put the load on the table they cannot allow these Democrats to continue to obstruct\nAgree a hundred percent\nI think he really got pretty she had a job here let's go to Susan clear lake spacesuit things were holding on welcome to the voice of Texas\n...\nThank you Sara what's on your mind is that you know\nI wouldn't watch it last week when they have the model they committed coverage of it\nThat way we can do they do more than seven days that was the shit that they do all these rhino like work out you know they get there and that the guys you know more on the boat\nYou know I agree ... percent they gave him an extra seven days what else can you ask for they're going to turn right around and ask for more and they're already\nUm a lot of there's this extensive list of inconsistencies now of missiles reportage even more comprehensive was nine general objections marked with underlined ... jaded by dozens of contradicting claims and unanswered questions\nAlso the deviations in her timeline to win the assault occurred or a very important\nAh divvy event occurred in the mid eighties or the early eighties when she and her early teens or late teens why did she cross out early in the early eighties and their statement for the polygraph report [noise]\nAlright well Mitchell lays it all out ms Mitchell the prosecutor\nIn July six tax the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid Nineteen eighties in\nJuly thirtieth letter to Senator Feinstein it happened in the early eighties her August seven statement to the polygraph or or public river\nSaid that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties then she crossed out the word early for reasons she did not explain September sixteen Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to a Washington Post article reporting it notes from the individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen\nShow are describing the assault is occurring\nIn her late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when it diligently occurred sports timeline of the trauma she claims in the event left her rage is even more questions\nShe alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about the last two years of high school which in fact that occurred in the early eighties well she had a couple more years of high school\nBut that was immediately after the event nothing she moves on to lay out image for ms Mitchell moves on to lay out in his for his version of what happened has been every bit of moving target is the timing of the event when speaking with her husband a mutual writes Dr Ford changed her description of the ... incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testify that she tells her husband about sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she formed her husband that she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both times he was referring to the same incident\nNow Michel explains that for his inability to remember where the house was on the events took place raises significant questions as does her inability to remember how she got to the party and back to her house\nShe told the Washington Post or the party took place more than seven miles from childhood home roughly a twenty minute drive from my childhood\nShe agreed this was also the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the part of your mouth but she has no memory of who drove or or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver [noise] given that all this took place before cellphones arranging a ride home\nWouldn't have been quite so easy indeed she said she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did for\nThe call anyone else there after\nFour testified that are friendly lend apparently the only other girl at the party did not follow Dr Ford after the party to ask is why she suddenly disappeared\nAs a real good friend there Dr Laura you left your best friend at a party with a bunch of rapists\nIn other words how to get home she had no cell phone she testified that she did not call for anyone to pick her up while she was in the house she testified that she ran out of the house without telling anyone so no one in the house gave her a ride home how did she arranged for a ride home she also moves on to her account of the alleged assault\nAnd how she is not offered a consistent account\nAccording to her a letter to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford or judge Kavanaugh andme a mark judge talking the other party go downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she couldn't hear them talking to anyone in her letter she stayed at a lock the door behind me\nBoth loudly stumbled down the stairwell which it went in which point other persons in the house or talking to them she testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs\nBut she maintain that she cannot hear the conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed a conversation took place\nIn the letter though Feinstein or as a Feinstein letter Ford makes it sound as though hearing the conversation downstairs what's your signal that it would say for her to leave the bathroom\nShe points out the the glaring inconsistencies and forwards account of how many people attended the Nineteen eighty two house party which remember that dateline has changed multiple times as well\nAccording to the Washington Post account of her therapy notes there were four boys in the bedroom in what she was assaulted\nShe told the Washington Post but the notes for erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter to Feinstein she told me that me and for others were present at the party in her testimony she said there were four boys in addition to leading Kaiser and herself she cannot remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward\nDr ... lifted Patrick PJ Smith is a bystander in a statement to the a polygraph or ... refer measure I ... in July sixth in the text of the Washington Post although she testified that it was inaccurate to call him a bystander\nShe did not list ... even though they're good friends leave Lynn Kaiser's presidents should have been a more memorable London BJ smash\nWhy would forward failed to note ... statement that their best friend ... Kaiser was at the party a woman who is still a lifelong friend\nWho has no recollection of this party just by their friendship Kaiser maintains under penalty felony she has no memory of this house party and she never even met Kavanaugh\nMitchell also focused on Ford's memory of recent events she struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post she could not remember of she showed a full of partial set of therapy notes to the post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the poster the poster border of the therapists notes on her own summary of those notes\nOr the Washington Post article said that portion of her therapist notes were provided by Ford and a brief viewed by the post\nArticle said the portions of her therapist notes were provided by Ford the brief viewed by the post but\nIn her testimony she could not recall whether she summarize the notes for the reporter or shoulder the actual records she does not remember she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post what's happened count on July the sex\nDr Ford set in their first what's that message to the post that she had therapy notes\nTalking about the incident when she contacted the post tip line [noise] she testified that she had reviewed her therapy nose before contacting the pose to determine whether they mention anything about the alleged incident but could not remember if she had a copy of those notes actually sending her what message are merely review them\nIn a therapist artist in fact for can't even remember crucial events around a polygraph test which he took in August less than sixty days prior to her committee testimony\nShe couldn't remember if he was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraphs and she could not remember what the polygraph occurred on the same day as her grandmother's funeral\nOr the day after her grandmother's funeral\nMitchell ads that it would have been inappropriate to administer polygraph to anyone who was grieving\nI tend to agree with that she reminds a committee to Dr Ford refuse to provide any of her therapy notes to them which means we will never know the truth of anything not only because Ford will not provide the notes because she claimed she cannot recall she showed the post the actual therapists notes or her version of them [noise]\nMs Mitchell leads up for comments on the claim that she's afraid of flying or at least she laid it for a full week the data the hearing was delayed because of the committee was informed that are ... these symptoms prevent her from lying but she agreed during her testimony that she flies fairly frequently for her hobbies and her work and her vacations\nShe flies with a medical clinic at least once a year to visit family she's for the Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing she goes on to point out that ah another delaying tactic that undercuts forge claim when she wished to remain anonymous\nNote to that church attorneys refused depriving hearing your interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear on whether the committee investigators were willing to travel to interview her in California\nIt therefore it's not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley offer to send investigators the meter in California or wherever she wanted me to conduct the interview boy how strategic was that like I didn't know thank you so much for offering that um [noise]\nYeah but you don't like flying are just not\nShe also pointed she originally wish for story to remain calm visual plus the person operating the tip of the Washington Post for the first person I've even if there was when she gets the identity of the attackers\nAllegedly [noise] she testified she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president but she never contacted dissent [noise] however because she claimed she didn't know how to do that [noise]\nShe does not explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not ... percent [noise] our will come back wrap this up on the other side you're listening to the voice of Texas A M seven hundred and have to be high in for a second this is Chris ex radio if you want to join us\nTo a one five five eight ... won five five eight five seven to ...

Do you guys think Mrs Ford was credible we watched it\nA thought her morning session went really well she seemed very credible by the afternoon session she seemed to be a bit coached and then I started digging through because she was a PHD in in psychology and I started watching her psychology and the way she was acting and\nAnd then you look at Mr Kavanaugh's testimony was at a table do testimonies wasn't it our lives go the phones to a one by five eight ... let's begin with big rich hanging in New York city have big rich thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas I go out

of Texas and you want to join us to a one size five eight five seven three eight to eight one five eight KGB or still discussing the cabin okay so now that we've had a few days doing just what we witness last Thursday\nA lot of people don't seem to be siding with Dr Ford in fact the only people that side with her so far that I've seen or most people that are really not willing to discuss this on a logical\nCohesive coherent manner to people that have sided with her you either agree with them or they will shout you down or shutting you out or you up\nThat tells you a little bit about somebody's reasoning now here's the deal I'm not saying that nobody agrees with it and I know I'm sure there are some people the believers story I don't really for the fact that I Know people that voted for Hillary Clinton simply because she was a woman\nI Know a woman that did this yet she doesn't believe it was Ford whatsoever she did not leave her testimony at all\nSo I ... the thing is once again I don't know I don't know if she was assaulted we have no idea we just the ones there are a few things that we do know all the evidence pointing to Kevin all was not at this party Kavanaugh was not there he had nothing to do her\nChristine Blasey Ford's best friend never met the man and she claims she was at the party\nAnd also with before claims she left her at the party took off after she was supposedly salted or allegedly assaulted she took off and left her there\nWith attempted rape is then\nOnce again once you dig through we went through the prosecutor said report that outline nine reasons why her testimony was not credible\nShe was unsure about who what when where and why how everything about it who paid for the polygraph who pays for her attorneys she was unsure about everything flying P DSD which flies multiple times there were so many holes in her story\nJust over and over but the one thing she was one hundred percent sure about was that it was kept up the one thing that no one else can corroborate\nThat tells me there may be something more player would you say in a not for sure let's go to the phones to lend who's actually holding in Pasadena Linda fink hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nAnd um I agree with you there are things going on um I was a ... a month down but it and I know that they that they don't you don't want to tell the\nStory I was constantly looking at her have burned out and trying to figure out what you said it's part of you know your story ... ...\n... and I think they had in July ... woman to try to you know make it look like\nThem ... psychologist one I think\nMaybe they thought well she would be able to plant some casinos like working with patients quite a bit them are being you know\nThe only way I mean what I call she was adopted she would have a great tool available to get self help after all these years and I mean I ... you know it's part of your history and you move on with your life\nWhen you made a couple of really good points the first one being that she she was continually looking at her notes and you're right if you will remember so clearly what actually happened to her\nTen hughley looking at her notes and you're right if you will remember so clearly what actually happened to her she would not have to continually get those notes and consult with her attorneys two of them\nGenerally it's not the way it is in and I know you mentioned and I'm Sorry that you were sold but unfortunately it happens to a lot of women and is a terrible thing and I hate the fact that it doesn't and why we went when I won't go down the road or what should happen to the person that assault you I've done that on other programs will go there but you mentioned\nYou pretty clear about what happened when we're one how would you need ... votes to describe that situation anyone wanted to\nKnow when I don't even have to close my eyes to read you know play it in my mind you need a when you have to look at any no\nNo that's and I like I said I think you know the weird thing and then I and I don't I don't like to go this route but we kinda have to generally it when someone has attacked a victim of victim will have a testimony or whatever they generally don't have to attorneys on each side of them\nAre usually that would be the criminal that's usually the person I'm not saying was legit boarded the criminal I'm just saying that she had two attorneys in multiple consultants and the entire democratic wing of they're working on her behalf and\nI Know you'll end up God Bless you they give us a call I'm so sorry to hear what happened to you and thank you for your for your insight on this I appreciate it\nLet's go to the need to who's holding in Dickens in need to thank you so much for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nMay [noise] um\nI didn't think three instances where I work ... parents she says you can't hear okay when she got this was this area when she was in one parent\nCan't remember early in there just\nIsn't that you're there for a couple of years in college I was kind of in that point but I think that\nWhen her parents\nWhy are you having such a problem at all and then also and why didn't you wait wait wait my mother\nShe didn't tell her mother and I just kinda like parents\nMan one other comment I haven't\nDone that\nPeople are talking about oh she was so calm during her testimony and you know Canada here and I thought she said\nAnd very well hey are you know ...\nOn the ground anyway ... those are my uncle fabricated they really do need to agree the first task when in in the morning her testimony came up a whole lot better I guess maybe because we get to see or longer I don't know what it was Monday afternoon she looked very coached\nAnd she was very strategic look the question she understood and what you didn't understand the funny thing is I'm not a PHD in anything\nI'm not a PHD and I understood every single question that was asked her now I'm not on sitting in front of the hearing so it was a big difference there but nonetheless\nShe mentioned old what just ... the thing is I still and it sounds like we're just beating up on her no we're not meeting up on her at all or simply deconstructing her story as to what's credible and what is it and why this was a trial which in this country the burden of proof\nIs not on the defendant\nThe burden of proof is on the prosecution's your job is to prove that person committed a crime when you're innocent until proven guilty and you notice the Democrats not a damn well one of them is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he's innocent until proven guilty every single one of them he's guilty until proven innocent but is that how they are\nIs that on the trails in his behaving is that how they act whenever they're charged with crimes hell no it isn't and this is politics pure and simple and the more we look into it the more it looks like as I said a little earlier\nSomething else is a maybe a little something else going on here and I think it's at this point is pretty clear let's go to Deborah listening in full Sher Debra thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHi Chris how are you know how how are you there but I Want to I Want to talk\nAbout the fact that she said there were four boys and two girls she was one of the two the lender has denied you know her involvement and then certain knowledge than she aims three of the poor boy isn't that funny how she dumping aim for parents lived in a house\nThat convenience and dumping match what the testimony once the talent now how does the amber where it is the other option that support or ... lived in the house and get the crash of how somebody that they get now it picks\nUp for four and lived in the house\nAnd he could prove or deny her story by telling whether he truly targeted\nAnd then she described the house and on the greatest detail of her entire testimony in the house that that that that the first place I think that can't be proven that cars for many kids who sit or that she doesn't remember where it was\nSo I think she's learning\nTerry in I Believe most implying a Denver thank you for the call I think you just brought up a really good point that no one's been talking about in your right I have not mentioned that she did mention that fourth person who clearly somebody had to have some connection to that home somebody had to be there\nAnd boy isn't it convenient that that's the one person that you can't remember I mean she's a hundred percent sure with Kavanaugh not when where how what happened who I was there\nNot any of those other things but definitely it was definitely Kevin off our list of unspeakable Greg visually holding in king would thanks for hanging on Greg welcome to the voice from Texas\nWhat we're doing is tearing apart their stories and their testimony everything he said was backed up and I know some of the questions he wouldn't answer one was would you call for this investigation\nThey kept trying to trick him the Democrats were doing this trying to trick him and saying well I Want an investigation\nOf course he wasn't going to do that he wasn't falling they're trapped because he knows exactly what they're doing and we're like right like it or not right and wrong or indifferent we know exactly what the Democrats are doing\nThey're trying to do and get this thing pass the midterms in case they pick up seats so they can stolen stonewalling and make sure the president does middle point another Supreme Court justice heat is very clear they made\nTheir actions between the two different people giving testimony completely showed that in fact almost everyone on the Democratic side who said they want this investigation further\nOr the same ones that said no matter what they find they're not going to hope for them so why are we investigating it any further\nWe know why they're trying to push it off as far as they can actually call will lead to a one side of a case to be let's go to Spencer listening ... Spencer thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHas been so are you there\nSo I don't hear anything so okay let's go to Don listening in Washington state done thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nGood afternoon Chris in her testimony she said she was wearing a bathing suit well I just did a Google Search about two miles out from the country club all around I found exactly six homes with swimming pools\nThat shouldn't be too hard to narrow down whether or not or any of those for the description of the interior that she was talking about\nThat's a good point I never thought I Would never have and what are you an investigator something\nDone actually I used I used to be an investigator for large law firm\nOkay man that's pretty short because you're right if they got the general area you could go back and look fight every house has got a pool and narrow it down and find out exactly who was\nJust go on Google Earth there's only a handful of them a two mile radius of that country club\nOh wow that's very I would've never thought I'd see this is why guys like you were good investigators and not me [laughter] I mean that's a great point they give us a call Don appreciate it\nYeah and he he makes a great point she was wearing a bathing suit and they were there to go swimming and supposedly Kevin I was trying to rip off for bathing suits river close she'd close on over top of that\nUm I just have to keep going back to the fact that she can't see where this ... and ... were the health issues there but ... ... out of this why didn't anyone else think to go and do a little Google Search for I guess things could have changed since then so maybe there's more ... who knows\nWhat the point is and he's awfully strategic and she can't remember the one guy who owned the house of where it was asked her how she got there she got home are\nOnce again when the only thing that she's one there's two things she's one hundred percent sure on one it was Kavanaugh that attracted to that she only had one beer first of all she's under age and drinking beer for judgment is impaired and two is why are those the only do things she's one hundred percent certain on\nIt just looks at some things don't hold water unlike a pool within two mile radius of the country club thanks for the call let's go to Martin Luther king in northwest used in marketing for hanging on welcome to the boys from Texas\nHey rich good show a you know the interesting thing and all of this and and I didn't see the complete ... but\nYou know this is the trial of public opinion this is an trial up act\n...
