was doing you're doing what I said he was going to jail said he was working on it earlier this week we asked where did you get why they do need will enrich\nCutting money we're giving the Palestine countries that hate is\nCutting down his budget the White House cutting down now these are agency Europe's are these cabinet members from there and your agency budgets [noise] maybe baby steps\nBut it's better than nothing special is you've got the unemployment claims unexpectedly falling to two hundred and ten thousand I imagine recruitment will be discussing that with your money here a little later are coming up there about forty minutes six PM stick around for that\nYou get President Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum deal or nail structuring maximum wage hikes for American Steel workers with US Steel corporation\nBut the Democrats the no no people aren't making more money I'm going to have been a few people get a few a few raises\nThe economy is soaring and as it goes the Democrats become more and more unhinged I Want to go back to the players in the first hour we're going to play it again I Want you to hear the whole song a little fun is our friday edition you may goes wrong tomorrow from four to six well we got a new Hillary song Korea\nHillary Clinton apparently the federal judge says the state department and body clearly false statements to derail requests for Clinton documentation regarding been gossipy in so much so that it shocked in dumbfounded the judge\nSaid sure uh Cheryl Mills she got immunity\nYou got the or the need the judge learn from the ... board that she'd been given immunity and that uh their their notation were inconsistent was typical investigative strategy\nAllow mills just sit in when I interviewed Clinton in other words she was treated with kid gloves handled very well would say she got the VIP treatment well you are you think you were I Would have gotten that kind of treatment regarding a an illegal server was top secret\nEmails on that server and I thought what a great time to hear a new Hillary Clinton song and this will be jurors if you listen real closely\nDefined to invoke lanes of mature one James combing years\nLet me [noise]\nYou know [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nRight and that means more you remember on fire minute there was no problem\nNo regulations for me [noise]\nMan by now\nAnd [noise]\nThompson Hi [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWhat [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou know it's kind of incredible when you go back and you hear the things she was saying and what she lied about under oath and the way she was treated and former secretary of State Clinton so they treated their with kid gloves and now we're learning and she knew the inspector general report [noise]\nThe illegality little lies in the direction only learned\nIt's gonna be interesting to see what pans out in this case nonetheless I heard that song it was like okay we have like this somebody sent me the song and thank you for sending it I I just there's video if you want to go watch it on YouTube or just like at this point what difference does it make\nWell made a difference between a corrupt administration and I'm sure Brock Obama was completely unaware\nYou want to see the difference in leadership looking Donald Trump is going on now all they get mad 'cause he called the stormy horse race and I know they didn't get mad when stormy talked about his penis and all these other things for the last few months the things they said about president no they don't get mad at me that he deserves it but ...\nWhen it comes to the president responding well then he's a horrible monster you know what he can color restraints only once\nIf he's going to continue to announce things like cutting five percent from the each member of his cabinet in an agency budgets\nYou said they're going to ask every secretary at five percent next year he spoke to his cabinet members during the White House meeting on Wednesday afternoon and said that some agencies may cut more than five percent he said get rid of the fat get rid of the way\nThe federal deficit jumped Seventeen percent in the last fiscal year that seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars the president defended recent dramatic spending in order to restore military funding admitting that he had to give Democrats waste of money to give them on board\nWe had to do that in order to get the votes because we don't have enough Republican votes without them he said that military funding would probably be around seven hundred million in the next budget instead of the earlier price tag of seven hundred and sixteen billion\nIt to start this is nowhere close to being his is as much as we'd like to start\nDoing some things I Would love to see what he does it with the next year regarding some of this but what happens ... and the only thing is talking about that I Know Rick Freeman with your money will talk about this more but they would get unemployment claims dropping again unexpectedly to two hundred and ten thousand\nThat's pretty amazing\nYeah comedy is soaring and the Democrats keep telling your wages are stagnant they're not rising there are more people working your wages rise when you go from not working to getting paid for a job right\nNow to turn Wrigley raise when you go from ... in ... and that's a bit of a raise right now they don't count that that doesn't count okay well what about people that haven't gotten raises what about the tax cut her dressed as I said oh this morning\nA talk and he was debating with a liberal I Can't remember the guy's name but he was trying to explain to him how are the the deficit spending that's the problem\nTax cuts do not at\n... call just to get less money no we cut taxes and into the last fiscal year the Irish brought in more money than it ever has in the history of this country\nBut I thought tax cuts are moving what does that mean if we didn't cut taxes than it would have been twice as much or three ... no that's not how it works what happens is you have more people working so guess what even though the payroll lower percentage\nThey pay more taxes water concept huh you may have everybody's working we get more revenue\nThat being said he's carrying a steady nine point lead over a guy who's going to spend more for a U.S Senate seat than ever in the history of this country what does that tell ya\nWell look I agree with you it's the only thing okay how does that move the conservative movement or\nDonald Trump through the different kind of guy we haven't seen a guy like him since Reagan in ...\nOkay yeah I'm the kinds of Republicans that we were electing re electing our identity area and nobody's really talking about economic or feel like I'm you know back in you know back to the future back in Nineteen eighty five are saying is that if\nWe hold on to say you did you when you when you say no one's talking about economics first of all I've been talking about economics all week and I'm not even an economist and I know you'll have your ... talked about it and get Lance on the weekends we will talk about it\nBut that being said we're talking about the economy we've got a historic low low unemployment you know the African American they is manic the female participation that kind of stuff we historic numbers going on over here we can't ignore that and a lot of it as a tribute it of course the Donald Trump\nAnd then you're talking about some of these other people look at Lindsey Graham is the golden granted ... for a long time because I've never been a big fan but look how hawkish and how um the Trump train he's become and how tough and now he's still Lindsey Graham\nBut we're seeing what leadership can do for a party compared to complete lack of leadership with people like John Maynard and those guys we're seeing now it's not going to happen overnight but I think we're seeing a very slow and calculated move there's a lot of Republicans that didn't rerun for seats this year\nSo we're seeing some differences and it's that I called the Trump ... to the Trump effect\nI I think that the Republicans would have an easier time uh I I don't think there would be a blue wave that they would have done something about ... the number one issue that people are talking about it not just\nYou know that people are on a on a short but it's just that it's it's so darn expensive and you know the Republican you add it at the at the data decades and gather and you know you know you can blame it on a new\nYear's there was a it was all will there in the first hundred days\nWe'll be talking about a blue wave east Republicans\nThey need to be held accountable I mean what when you don't get me wrong but where do you ever read don't deserve to get power back but let's not forget these were not give them a tax you guys did not help dropped in the beginning and and now there and now there\nAre other late to the party is he it got all the power\nJames you first of all when you just said it was absolutely right these guys were not they were not on board in the beginning they've been dragged kicking and screaming on board and understand from a different kind of Republican these populist innings very different animal\nThat being said he was the only be strong enough and willing to go after the Democrat Party as hard as they go after everyone else and what they've done so you make some really good thank you for the call James appreciate it you've made some great points and to go back to this\nAnd we're slowly but surely seeing that tide turning you do about the Republicans you're right they passed bill after bill after bill to repeal Obamacare until they actually had the presidency and then you couldn't get them to get one hell he and President Trump had to go to Twitter in shame Republicans in order to repeal the individual mandate was pathetic\nBut that means that it's changed in John McCain was the deciding vote he's gone God rest his soul like him don't like him doesn't matter he's gone that's different Republicans are or you're right there's a lot of them that I don't like and there are some that I really liked Andrews is when I Do like I like Rand Paul\nThis is what we talk politics is about negotiation that doesn't change overnight we can't just go declare oh you guys are bad news you got to hurt the old adage\nJumping from the frying pan into the fire\nThe last thing you want to do is go this guy's pat only agree with this guy Seventy five percent of the time let's go over and get somebody else that I agree with that person gets dumped by somebody that you agree with zero percent of the time\nThis is a marathon it is not a sprint it needs to be a marathon because this is important stuff you're absolutely right we do need to hold them accountable and we need to make sure they're hitting in the right direction Trump is dragging them kicking and screaming towards conservatism\nI did I did not see that coming don't me wrong I voted for him not vote for him I said if he did have\nSome what he was going to do I used to be ten times better than Brock Obama or\nHillary Clinton he's a hundred times better than those clouds [noise] he is doing everything to the campaign abroad and he's making America great again yesterday America's Best place to do business in the world again\nAfter ten years wow what a coincidence he's doing that
