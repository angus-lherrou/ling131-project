I mean we're both cruise ship orders in fact I Walk walk for him but um there was my wife gave me a criticism of\nAs a performance last night she said that whenever they handed over to me it was kind of smiling and laughing and moving around and she wanted him to be a little bit more\nUm story I guess you could say\nOK so who is\nKind of a criticism of that but you know we're we're both cruise orders you know it you know with everything you know saying that he wants to we're at a crucial point in our country but he never does tell us what does that crucial point is a\nGood point I think if we go read and you're right I think body language can say one thing but you're right you get two guys are up there in front of a whole lot of people watching and you know what do you stay there still liquor shaking your head I think Ted Cruz's trend send a message last night he was laughing at this guy\nBecause this guy's attempt to the to go at him has been pretty poor he's he's he's been lucky enough to generate all this money from outside of the states\nBut the reality is on the facts and that was a good point to\nAssure made earlier the ... when it comes to the facts to prove destroyed

K. C. V. we're gonna take a few calls a will also get to the story about state rep Ron Reynolds\nAre going to be reelected while behind bars that's reining in jail\nAnd spoiler alert and he's a Democrat or the odds of that to anyone five are they can see being to eight one five five eight five seven three eight let's go to John hanging on in east Houston and Jon thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey how you doing today Chris I'm very good how are you John I\nWatched I watched the debate last for Cruz also read about they tell you the Democratic National Committee at the sun is thirty eight bucks that some of the Democrats and he told him no he needed all this money\nYou had mentioned that little earlier you're absolutely right here in the last quarter he generated over thirty eight million dollars they asked hey man can you spread the wealth knew a little less socialism stuff he's always preaching and he absolutely flat out told them no I got that money\nAnd I'm going to spend it on his on his campaign so you know is that all you do as I say not as I Do sort of thing\nYeah I Do to change gears a little bit more local scene\nI saw today are luxurious city council approved Eighteen million dollars for phase one of the face or an airfield for launching a lower orbit satellites in any satellites in about ...\nRight in the middle of one of the most I laid it it's just areas on the Gulf Coast\nSounds All right we're going to be around from the flooding around it\n[laughter] I Hope we don't all dress I did not know they voted on that today I knew that was coming up and I didn't know it was today so they voted to approve that money so now they're going to be launching rockets from over the Ellington Field\nA part of the plan for the space or just any satellite launch facility don't lower orbit satellite which calls for the use of sounding rockets\nOr the military folks out there those are pretty good size rockets and said you see the largest chemical\nThose are pretty good size rockets and said you see the largest chemical industry a change in in the world just over the horizon from there plus all the population there are a real interesting watching those\nYeah there you know what there is definitely some some hesitation their paws on one thing I I Am excited about I'm a big fan of NASA and Smeets an old ... because I Know that is the future of mankind regardless of what people want to think but nonetheless there is a lot of\nWell the Houston area has a lot of obstacles and you mentioned a little extra and all of the uh the refineries and things that are not they're just a stone's throw from that area that can be a little disconcerting it seems like that would be something that would bring money into our city and of course our state\nWell it will bring money but it takes development you know they are there at the state pays for it down their Mustang Island down and then there was another ... days or authorized over the next ... de la ... companies become you got involved\nAnd they're not they're not going to come here 'cause there's not enough room\nAnd you may be right I was gonna say that would be my thought is you need a lot of space for that I don't know we have just the sheer land area the good thing is that close to NASA so that that that's a good thing but that seems I don't know I'm going to have you learned more about this I'm Glad you told me about this because that's\n... that's going to be taking place over Ellington Field where the uh the wings over Houston is taking place this weekend\nThat's right they set aside Ninety acres over there for development of this facility and you know I just like I say it's it's absolutely amazing\nWhen you know what I've been talking about I haven't talked to my knocks in a while I use a friend of mine I Know my city council I may have to reach out to him and get him on the program and talking about that next week I'm pretty well swamp this week but I may get 'em on and have to talk about that because\nYou know what as Isaac sided I Am to hear the we'll be launching rockets here in the Houston area right by NASA veers you're absolutely right there's sounds like there could be all kinds of curve balls and even one of these things goes off central and crashes over him and the refineries that could be a catastrophe\nI you know they are doing it for years and a lot of places around the country and it got pretty good record but it just don't seem like it's a good spot Clinton or something like that\nI Would think maybe aircraft development shops buildings things like that yeah but when I read today that it includes the development of a lot of these mini satellites and low earth orbit satellite I was\nYou know I'm definitely you have to learn more about that thing for the call I appreciate the news and the comments on the the debates are doing one five five eight can see the if you want to join us two one five five eight five seven three eight was speaking with John who's holding in Jersey village thinks we're hanging on John welcome to the voice of taxes\nDon't worry too much about the ... or ... or chemical plants they are all or a\nRocket launchers ... air force safety officer saw that thing goes wrong it's like a contest and blow it up in the air the same thing happened with the first explosion of the um\n[noise] I'm a I'm a staff\nUp what Sally Ride I didn't I didn't even think about that you make a very good point you're right I guess what they're worried about him getting ready dollars outta there was push a button they some\nAn air force officer at the same thing goes ... at the bottom of the um a shuttle expose their life\nOkay that makes sense because I didn't even think about that yeah you're\nAnd once again you can buy some is\nDespite the hesitation you're right these are things we look into and especially I mean I don't know how much territory they are going to have a Ninety acres or\nOr whatever but we're also talking about small satellites and things like this would seem like it'd be on a smaller scale and then we look at what's happened with Tesla here in the last year so the way they can launch these rockets into the boosters come right back now and land on the launch them\nWith the technology is getting pretty good these days so so I think you may be right on John\nWell there are other there are other mistake or was that I'm On a a a shuttle was it a a more than ... at a temperature limit on those sales and uh they washed or for the very low temperature bottom temperature when\nOh anyway yeah that'll that'll do it man the rating\nLike one a I'm a shuttle was designed they there was an escape products for all of them is a ... it was separate from the rest of the cargo by rockets jettison it out and uh they ran out of money on the side that built that way\nOkay well thanks for the call John appreciate this is a great thing about being near NASA because we have a lot of people literally rocket scientists out there in fact I Know a couple I Know a couple of guys are actually rocket scientist that worked out at NASA so well one of them doesn't work there anymore he\nGot laid off years back and then now he's a pilot so I actually know a few people that are either are or rocket scientist I Am not a what ... what is it I'm not a brain scientist or rocket surgeon to mix them in Fort Hayes jak will do it and take a break when we want to come back we got one more segment and then we'll pick up all Sen Cruz\nIs on the other
