F. C. V. we're going to go to Senator Paul Bettencourt I asked him to call me back on today's program because we were really short on time and he's back today talking about some really scary stuff you're on Halloween\nOf dinner Betancourt thank you so much for being here this afternoon\n[noise] Hey Chris wherever they are getting mash couldn't Harris County and it's really a you know it's I mean it's classic Halloween story because you believe that this is definitely a Democrat trick and not a trade by the end of this discussion [noise]\nYeah well then you gave us a heads up yesterday people ... well I guess getting I won't let you talk to people are registering to vote with illegal addresses devoted right\nWell we we got ironclad proof that it a hundred sites around Harris County\nThere's at least can and sometimes up to eighty four voters that register at what our commercial addresses doubt these commercial addresses like another one is the UPS Store Thirteen to wall drive\nThere's eighty four people there and of course they're not they're they're just allowed to be there by the voter registrar and Harris Bennett who refuses to comment on any of this story hit she won't come at it and even after Fox News\nOn any of this story has she won't comment even after Fox News ran a story last side so what what happens is that she's allow somebody to basically say instead of a PO box\nThey call it an apartment and so apartment to to to or should I say on our way and that should be saying apartments six six six\nI'm is\nRegistered but it is a a PO box and the person never gives a physical address or whether they live now ... mountain up pretty fast the first one is out of this one box twenty two people have already voted\nAnd that was the difference between two judges candidates in the Republican primary and three times the state rep race when a that was my Jackson's\nWait wait a minute I sort of bigger when you say on the one box you mean that many people were registered to just one box or just that one location\nI mean it's not even about it but I should say box 'cause that's bracing if one location ... say it's one UPS Store has eighty four people now if you don't believe me go to eight feet tax dot net that's H. T. T. A. X. dot net and it said that it's\nA a you know here says it's her a website and she's the elected Democrat burger registrar tax assessment Harris County had just type in you know Thirteen to walk drive\nAnd you'll see it also type in the jails\nBecause there was fifty people registered at the jails of which fourteen have attempted to vote by mail\nAnd the county clerk who's done a great\nJob on the stand standard will be you know obviously a requesting that those ballots not be counted because they got criminal histories and they can see that people are under you know uh you know that are all over the country that have their under current you know a criminal in your introduction\nAnd they can say that the terms of service so they can't they can't vote\nWas one of them are on rental say rent\nA robot [laughter] yeah he's in a different facility okay her hand in hand and because\nThe speaker Strauss blocked my colleagues that day was bill he's throwing member legislature but we're going to fix that night session\nNew okay that's good to hear um here's my question for you so we're we're finding these places around town where clearly also that's going to mess up the um against a jury duty because clearly they these people don't live at the UPS office or whatever\nAnd so here's my question we got these around uh I guess you're are you trying to go through and not only you you mentioned that the inmates voting but what about these people are trying to get those don't also they don't count as well\nWhere are the problem is is once you know once the federal register register them their votes gonna count unless you've got a specific way like at the jail to that you know to take him back out of the system\nNow if Chris Daniels I should get him to call him because he's a district clerk you know and he's got jurors coming in from the UPS Store\nWe think that about half of these people are people that live out of the county that I haven't had their voter registration\nCanceled yet wow so\nIf they're on a jury what what's that jury or ... or jak may run that come out of the killer killer cheerleaders mom or something what was that\nI get by the new the new mother who tried to hire someone to kill the arrival cheerleaders I remind\nThat's it right okay right Holloway maybe yeah I think it was one of Halloween I think you're quite what\nThat set right she got her conviction thrown out because the jury was ineligible to serve so so that's a big problem for Daniels and even county treasurer uh uh Orlando Santos showed up because he said look why might sending money to our county jurors [laughter]\nNow that ... these\nResistance wells department of public safety gives a driver's license while they were very interested to find out how this this has all been gamed\nAnd it's because the coding allows somebody to Richard ATT apartments for PO box\nAnd um and so they were fascinated because you don't want the driver's license out to be a physical address because if you have an that's why we had nine one one laws that say you know tell us your physical address so if we have to come get you know where you are\nI mean look it's a bad thing you know around it's preposterous that eighty four people live in a in a store and it's repeated all over the place I'm One of the rabbit and five to last time or next to a really good restaurant they are all based shows up\nAnd got forty nine registered voters and I could go on and on all around town\nNow his I guess would know what happens even a and we didn't we can't do the future but what happens we have all these contested races I guess that are very close say thirty forty fifty sixty one hundred votes will is there any way to go back and look and say well these votes are illegal these votes don't count and I guess is that where they would look at it\nChris that is exactly what I told the editors of the chronicle the day and there was one that I understood out of three guidance band\nAid because we've we've seen this movie before so if we were expecting a very close election so if you got that quite frankly for Democrats last they would use is sort of the public is good they would have to call these voters in one by one in front of a judge and ask a new they voted for\nWow yeah so you feel like I mean an end to end the crazy thing is this elected official will not respond if they won't even call chronicle back okay Dr\nThe chronicles covered in the last week and they should\nUm because all the information I gave you just do a ... they I'm a ... but the first of all do it\nAnd you know and I so\nSo ... so we now know the integrity of the vote rules at risk because well let's say she sat on an anticipation changed and bought three hundred voters in Baytown from voting and then she's in the final point I'll make she's in federal court and Virginia\nRefusing to release the names of self identified non citizens that go to the jury summons and say I'm not a set of said let me out and Chris Daniel says that information to her she won't acknowledge who they are or if they're being taken off the road rules\nUh uh the killing of black I'm Sorry blacks getting the police officers\nWhich he had the ... there was a black lives matter in Dallas texas where five police officers were killed by a guy who was sympathetic to the black lives matter movement\nSo that means that black lives matter is they were killed\nOr he was killed they were killed in a black lives matter rally by sympathetic to their cause that sounds someone into late and\nSo then if someone is sort of Donald Trump and kills ... been done itself is also as possible correct\n[noise] coed what I mean the logic\nTo the black lives\nBut we're losing your right All right we'll tell you what we got to go because your we got a bad signal we're losing you if you're trying to make was if I'm going to blame someone kills cops who's saying I didn't blame Donald Trump's\nBlack lives matter is in order to there's a group that had multiple rallies there were people assaulted people killed ... police officers murder and police officers had cinder blocks dropped on their heads and people assaulted and all kinds of things to these events when I say black lives matter and that's what I'm Talking about not all black lives matter people agree with that\nNot all black lives matter people or murderers are killers or even assaulted and stuff but we saw what happened repeatedly those events to deny that simply denying facts which if you want to go and try to pin this\nThis rapist dude who went and murdered these Jewish people in synagogue Donald Trump even though he's spoken out against them\nYou know what I'm not going to get very far with you but I appreciate your call nonetheless thank you for the call and we got a Harris County clerk district ... Daniel on the line now Hey Chris are good to talk to you again thanks for calling in the program\nChris thanks for having me back on the program I wanted to follow up on what my good friends of it or\nWas alerting our listeners to and the uh rampant or illegal voter registration that's going on across the county here and I had to explain it to a dear friend of mine earlier today when we did the press conference we had eighty four registered at that location\nThere are hundreds of locations across town you were talking thousands of voters\nAnd we did not just bring this up at a press conference a few days ago K Betancourt had a previous press conference that was under for were were reported and I are a whole new press release that went out three months ago and then you had a citizen that made a voter challenging all these folks\nEven earlier than that that has been ignored in stone walls were all this mess so this isn't something that would just\nBrought up to take advantage of the election season we've been bringing it up for the last six months consistently and yet for whatever reason the major news network for weeks after the Fox news has not covered this issue\nAnd we're so imperative now with the district clerk's office\nIs that these voter registrars are ending up in our jury pool and God help us if one of these illegal jurors ends up quitting a murderer or ends up putting a way an innocent man for life because they decided to muddy the waters and take advantage of two of your constitutional duties\nAnd a squirrel it away so that they are not only feeling about that also ruining a jury\nAnd it is not okay it needs to be investigated easily put a stop to and I call upon any and all appropriate at that scared of authorities\nTo get to the bottom of this and put it into it because it is not fair to the citizens of Paris counting that somebody could just illegally registered to vote willy nilly private PO box and then over by the way\nEnded up screwing up somebody's jury pool and every once in a while but we send them a jury notice it ends up on deliverable why because they don't live at that PO box but what did they do when it comes election time they re register once again at the same PO box and take advantage of the system and lord knows how many times are doing this\nOr how many how many places across here sounding much less United States that they're doing this\nIs from rod it's wrong it's against the law and needs to be processed it needs to be investigated and as a warning to any citizen who may have done this accidentally or ignorance of the law all you have to do to Europe\nIs you go to your early voting location or your election they pull and you hit them your actual permanent address you sign a statement of residency which are updated actual address you vote as if\nIt nothing was the matter and nothing happens you it's pure because you're no longer lying on a government documents\nYou know I Can't disagree with anything you just said a Chris we're talking with Harris County district ... Daniel here's my question when you talk about the authorities or somebody going to do something about this who can we talk to I mean there are lots of NATO do we have these are police who do we have to get involved to look in three different\nFolks second that they can start the process we already turned over a bulk of information through servant and courts office to the attorney general's office they can begin the investigation on the on the global effect of this voter fraud to to the state effect\nAnd the district attorney locally after the election is over and start pairing up people who have quote registered to vote at a PO box and then voted using that residents and see if they find that after David thing they did in fact we live in a tiny metal box\nAre located inside a PO box store and then go and prosecute them and the attorney county attorney can do the same thing I mean my God the county attorney spent hundreds of thousands of dollars by their own admission\nInvestigating Dave Wilson HCC trusts the as to whether or not he actually lived at in fitness which in fact he did and he won the court case if they're willing to spend a hundred thousand dollars against the Republican HCC trust the why not spend a few more and go after\nAll the thousands of people were registered to vote illegally at these PO box\nI have a bunch of friends with the oil and gas industry and they're saying Hey Chris wait a minute I'm sure all the time what do you need I Can't use the PO box you can send mail to your PO box but you cannot say that is your permanent resident\nYou look at your voter registration card you'll see there's two boxes when it says mailing address one that says permanent address you risk for you physically lift\nWell the mailing address one of those permanent address you risk for you physically it as your permanent address and then the mailing address you can put the PO box that's not registering to vote or the PO\nBox set it usually appeal box appropriately reporting mail\nYou a red hair as your permanent resident at a PO box you're committing fraud you're stealing vote and you're ruining my jury pool\nYeah well Chris I hate to tell you there's nothing you just want some democratic votes goes why this is a bipartisan\nIssue at the end of the day they should care about the cheating you care about justice for all you want to talk about these very advocacy groups it it would be a fair and impartial jury and got help somebody tried to game the system and ends up with a runaway grand jury trying to sneak onto a jury of capital murder case\nWherever I Am sitting right here\nI mean this is cut both ways but you're not a Republican issue this is not a Democrat as you're a libertarian this is a fundamental constitutional rights issue it's like right through a fair election in a right to a fair trial in these folks they're doing is they're going to get around to all\nFine there was a waiter immediately cure this and he ended the day at all Red Army ... collector or parent Lee is asleep at the sweat you're not doing your job\nI agree ... around the time Chris Daniel Harris county district lurks you just heard the reason why I voted for Chris Daniel and hopefully a lot of other people here in the same thing and the reason why I made the comment that I made\nIs because we have a certain population and we'll say we know exactly which way they tend to vote that does not care about federal immigration laws they don't care about the border in fact they don't care about a lot of things other than power\nAnd I think those are the ones that I was referring to Chris thank you for calling in I appreciate your time when you take a short break\nA once you get in Harris County district court Chris Daniel usually very passionate about [noise]\nHe said was wrong [noise] she was she had almost everything you said [noise]\nWas my first time probably won't be my last\nWe're going to take a very short break he got Tony outside for rabbit spring Clinton in Fort Worth you guys all hang on this was a very short break we'll be right back I'll get with all your calls on the other side you're listening to sex radio to a one size five eight K.

mean they\nThey just don't they don't let facts getting away of their crazy a a process um anyway what else what else is really going to say is that I mean\nI Hope Trump does actually put Fifteen thousand military on the border\nTrump does actually put Fifteen thousand military on the border\nUm because when he first said he was put an eight hundred dollars go all eight hundred a year and a half\nOr so I Hope he does that and I hope we don't let a single one come across because the thing is once you do that once then there's going to be repeated thing is just like it's going on for you know forever you know uh the second thing I Would say is that\nAfter the midterms Trump is to get\nThe Congress together and say I'm On a walk you guys in a big room\nFor as long as it takes for you to come up with a better immigration policy that doesn't promise all kinds of free stuff for illegals coming into our country is crazy\nWell as as writers you are more than you would call his writings you are with all would you just said the problem is\nIs those on the left don't care they they want what they want and they have proven\nAs as Chuck Schumer said when we were in charge indeed the nuclear option was wrong when they're in charge they forced bill now they do whatever they want to and whenever they can and the moment they lose power they say he was wrong and you can't do that to us and in the moment they gain power again which is why it's so important for us to vote in\nHis mid term election the moment they get back power they go right back to it the reality is if the Republicans lose these midterms if they lose the house or the Senate's\nThere will be articles of impeachment brought up again they're going to do everything they can to impeach the president to impugn him and stop it and they can't remove him from office but they sure as hell will do everything they can to stifle anything that he wants to do they don't want to work with this guy they don't want him to do anything\nThat shows well for the America American people are this country\nIf they if anything that he does look good they ignore it they don't care they just simply about power and they made it very clear Hillary Clinton herself said she they can't be civil until they have power again\nThat's a dangerous precedent is more bond and that's why we're preaching on these airwaves get out and vote\nDo not let those kinds of people take back power in our country because that's clearly all they want and they don't care about you know there's a stupid little mean online she'll Donald Trump he says the reality is they're not after me there after you he's just in their way\nThat is a very accurate name thanks for the call mark preaching it let's go to bill a Brooklyn built who's hanging on to Brooklyn thanks so much for hanging on bill how are you\nReally good ah I just started listening or the auditors like October or listen to him several times and\nThe thing is the left will discard or distort\nWhat is truth and ... and they use like art site generalization worn case that's it right er Cox has given instructions guy white black Hispanic\nOkay or black or Hispanic guy white guy okay you're you're fit the bill so that you use an inductive reasoning but let's talk and so they like to discard things let's talk about the Unabomber\nWill hold them before you get to that not only that middle they will purposefully distorts the we've had two callers into this program they wanted to blame the synagogue shooter on Trump\nAnd it is clear Trump hasn't Jewish family members he's been the biggest friend to Israel that we've seen in the White House in at least thirty to forty years he's anything but a racist or an anti Semite but they don't care and they will distorting the fast they're taking a horrible terrorist act\nAnd blaming it on him because socks do not matter to these people it is all about power is all about manipulation and what they want to do and I'm not going to allow them to get that get away with it on my program I'll be nice\nAnd I'll be courteous as long as you're courteous to me but I'm not going to allow people fled outline we've had two of them come flat out was blatantly false information on the program tonight\nAnd there's nothing I said that would change their mind you've hurt 'em right when I told you that the guy was clearly not a conservative or a Trump supporter it didn't matter to him one bit he didn't care anyone can do your thoughts\n... yeah the thing about the Unabomber he was really left is from Michael Savage says that's a mental disorder and in fact I was rather that turned a man I remember that case has raunchy he ... he\nUh he decided well I'm going to plead guilty and sorted don't get the death penalty okay ... or ... I think his name or something I'm not mistaken\nHis hand and he was extreme left this and then what reason he is rather he said I notice my these writers or is that you're spending or this is something going that sounds like my brother you know\nAnd he went to see what they were they were they will discard him overweight because he fits the grill and you could throw a monkey wrench into their ears and then I Will distort they will discarded first oh that doesn't know that doesn't apply to us\nA bill you remember Timothy McVeigh\nAutomate ... oh yeah he was radical to the right well no that's what they told us they told us he was a hardcore radical to the right he was not\nTimothy McVeigh was an anarchist former military and he went straight up anarchy he was up there oh everyone said oh he's a Reese radical to the right during the Clinton Administration the Oklahoma City bombing but absolutely this is what happens when the left gets a hold of things and they're not the only ones\nBut especially on their side revisionist history is part of their process and it's it's just one of those things they do we have taken right thank you for the call bill always good to hear from you\nAnd you're dead on about Kaczynski I was told my entire life that Timothy McVeigh was ... was a\nPublic said he was radicalized his wife [noise]\nAnd um we actually research the guy was a straight up anarchists he lost his mind he was he knew what he was doing was clearly do is crazy you want to go ... and people for no reason with a bomb he was not he was not the right person if you will see the reality is it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter if they're a leftist for right is they're responsible for their own actions you cannot blame that on the other side when I Know bill was trying to do that [noise] the other callers were trying to blame everything on Trump\nThat the insanity of the lessons from the arrangements syndrome is real and he drives them further into into lunacy every day to anyone five five a case to be you're listening for sex radio we got one segment remaining ready to come back and\nThe Halloween edition of the program the ruling [noise]\nListened
