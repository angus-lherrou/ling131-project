and remember adopt do shop\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\nYou're here with me on the lifestyle unlimited real estate investor radio show this is Linda ... was settling possibly mistake to avoid hearing rehab and we're talking about the causes mistake as a complete scope of work\nWe talked about the importance of capturing all the details so we can compare rehab quotes avoid misunderstandings and get the results we want\nAnd we review some of the frequently forgotten items like landscaping tree removal or tree trimming censor pair replacement\nAnd then we were talking about some of the things that require some additional attention to evaluate those are our heating and air conditioning systems plumbing electrical and root for parents just because they're hard to evaluate from the ground and\nWe if we look at these things and we get infections we read those inspection reports\nAnd we look at anything that is either pass its useful life\nRequiring repairs or likely troop require repairs and the next five years and we add those into our numbers than we know that we're going to be able to create a property that's going to make a great rental property with a minimum amount of maintenance issues\nOr a property that is going to sell quickly because of the major systems have been accounted for and it's not something that the buyer needs to\nTo focus on it and pay for and if we can wrap those into our we have numbers and we have good\nThat could capture and we have the cash flow for rental properties then we have a when we have a project worth doing\nBut if you don't correct these systems if you don't identify what's wrong you're going to have unexpected expenses\nThat are going to eat into your profits and eat into your ability to create the wealth and passive income that we're here to create as a real estate investors so this is a discipline that is really important\nFor successful investors to get a handle on and it is one of the most costly mistakes we see in real estate investing is an incomplete scape before so that when everything is done the property is not the best property in the neighborhood has trouble renting has trouble selling\nSome other things to think about is um upgrades often we we see she upgrades missed in scope of work thinks that people don't think much about floods in switches\nYeah if you go through and you upgrade everything you've got beautiful new flooring you've got beautifully painted walls new you know new light fixtures maybe and then your parts and switches are old they're going to stand out\nAnd be noticed it is a minor detail but an important detail to include in your skip before things like hardware do you have old finishes\nYou have mismatched finishes and this is true for lighting is well sometimes you're going to need to replace lighting simply because the finishes or out of style are mismatched across the house and it's not creating a look that is attractive to renters or to buyers um exterior items making sure that\nYou know there's no rotted trend that fighting is in good condition and then\nMaking sure that you don't go halfway on updating bathrooms in kitchens those are important to all family members there used extensively by the family there are things that people look at when they're choosing properties to live in\nAnd you need to make sure you can make the updates on the repairs that are necessary so that your tenants or your buyers will want to live in that home\nSo that's our fourth and what I think possibly are most important state to avoid during rehab and we've talked about some ways that you can avoid making that mistake let's move on to number five underestimating carrying costs\nThis is all about getting the numbers right it's really important that we understand all of the cost involved in a deal so that we can evaluate it up front and know where we're going to end up with our numbers\nSo what are some of the things that people often forget when they're looking at sharing costs\nIt's utilities and yard maintenance during the rehab and during the process of securing your tenant and getting your tenant moved in\nAnd again for flippers I've just got to give you these little notes lifestyles unlimited isn't about flipping um I Believe that flipping is that it back in strategy or that you need to have some experience in the market and you have to have some financial reserves\nThat for your own protection if you're going to be flipping properties but uh this applies to flippers as well so I Want to call it out many flippers miss the additional taxes insurance agent waive fees maintenance yard maintenance fees and utilities during not just the rehab time but you're marketing\nTime and it's time to close once you have the sale and when you forget that you're talking about thousands of dollars of expenses that you didn't count on\nWe'll be back to wrap up our conversation on the seven possibly

hard to tell what you have because what you have do deteriorate and gone yeah that could have been a light colored door and it gets so bad it looks dark\nYep yep off and on the other side of the door the cherry say well that was probably and I look even good even that is going to change over the years because of everything they put on top era thing and so forth things can yellow and change on friday and he gets only two hundred and forty nine dollars it not three hundred said\nA over fifty dollars today to wait one three nine seven three Seventy nine only five people will get this deal today\nCall now to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine one more time to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine we talked about out against elation and the first segment town\nIt's important I Would I Would say that if you have to have that at work done and you're deficient in insulation I Would probably have that done first unless you have absolutely no ventilation but chances are you have some\nUm and then I'd probably do radiant barrier last depending upon if I had trees or other building that we're shadowing my house\nYeah I thought yeah every house a little different um insulation definitely almost every house that we do we add insulation I'm a lot of them would you know we'll we'll go out and wet inflation will put a couple of solar fans in and maybe had a radio or all all at once I mean just depends on the house we just do the house yesterday\nAnd it was a removal and we did new a new insulation got all the old inflation a solar fainted but they already had already ... so in that case they didn't really need and they really didn't even need the radio that they had it wasn't really giving them the value because it was there was a lot of trees over the roof\nSo when I had a case like that if they hadn't had writing but I wouldn't have recommended it because it was over and king would and was covered in trees\nSo insulation made way more sense they are going to get a lot of bang for money quick return on investment always tell people I like to kind of giving realistic expectations so I'm not going to say well you put a solar fan and it's got to pay for itself in three months\nIt's probably not the case it might be a year or depending on the on the addict temperatures and what's going on and maybe a three year pay back and then I let them make the decision which way they want to go because some people say well you know through your pay but it's pretty good at thirty three percent on my money that's not bad\nPlus you get the tax credit missing certain things so we kind of go over all that and would come out and we do the analysis and that's really the best place to start when you're doing looking at doing an addict and take a look at it let an expert look at it and see what you actually need\n'cause a lot of times you don't just need everything just like picking your car into to the shop and doesn't necessarily need breaks in a battery and a new windshield and new tires and it doesn't need everything and maybe it maybe doesn't even started tires\nBut if you don't have a car if you have to [laughter] read of their trial lawyer everything maybe two years old maybe you might want to go somewhere else get a second opinion so we don't do that will look at the attic and see what it actually needs but um and then the radio barrier you know if it's exposed to the sun\nAnd you've got dark shingles it you definitely need to do like your your black roof yeah of course you need ...\nYeah you know if you if you can that you want to do that but if you don't have any inflation and then I was doing it more or less the start with the inflation throw it in a new one a lot of times it's not a real big house like Melissa's do both with the same time because most of our projects we can do within a day or\nDoesn't take too long usually a couple of hours per function so for doing insulation figure a couple of hours right in a couple of hours so usually most people they want to take a day off of work to actually do the work we can do it all in one day and we also do Saturday appointments and do installed on Saturdays as well\nFifty percent off certain he'd blown in insulation today here on the ... radio show for my friend Tom decker addict innovations he'll put an eight inch add in on top of what you have it makes a huge difference he did it in my home I Love it I've got three different addict as well\nUh ordinarily dollar ... square foot only Ninety five cent\nSix callers\nCan get it however three of already gotten it\nYes yes it will happen so basically when they call will come out with the addict analysis and that they like if they need inflation them will honor that price for that so I've had a few people call me or I'll get out there and I just oh I I was one of the first six hours or so I was getting the whole house full of free installations like\nNo it's a free addict analysis I just make sure everybody because we're in the last three straight forward it's a free analysis will come out and look at it and see what you need and then we'll give you fifty percent off the whatever the insulation if that's what you need it if you needed maybe don't need it maybe maybe it would be a better option so really the ... come on look at it and then we'll go from there that's the best thing to do\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine only three more callers can get the deal and before we move into radium\nAll they can get the deal and before we move into radium barrier in solar addict fans I Want to just finish this deal to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nIf this is something you think that you want to have done within the next four six eight weeks call now there's something you want to have done next year leave the phones open for people who really want that you can Tom can only give the deal with it so many people\nYeah we did that too sometimes some would get people to oh I get out there like oh we're going to do something we're thinking like maybe two years we're actually going out of the country for six months I Will call me and six months so you know some of the good even changed over the six maybe what they decide well now we're going to sell the house and\nWell now we just want to bring it up to maybe in our thirties just to pass minimum building ... we don't want to do the are thirty eight so ten of you know do it when you're ready if it's\nTo me there's no time like the president so if you're thinking about doing insulation and he's thinking well maybe in two years we're going to sell the house well when you sell it they're going to do a home inspection and then they're going to look at the inflation and if it doesn't meet building code it's got to come up on the inspection report is insufficient insulation and somebody's gonna want you to pay for it\nSo if you do it now it within the two years it could pay for itself just an energy savings and you don't even worry about it we put gauges in there and you're you're good to go so\nReally is no time to presidents do insulation\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine is Tom's number Tom Kaine into the phone right now sometimes he does but he's on the air right now it goes to his truck the staff at the office they're fantastic um you know I'm I have
