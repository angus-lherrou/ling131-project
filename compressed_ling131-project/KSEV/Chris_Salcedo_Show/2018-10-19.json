Monday\nAnd there's no question that Republicans had the wind everything was going against him we were headed to a major major a political I think thrashing not in Texas I Texas is never going to elect a statewide Democrats never never never never\nBut I'm In the rest of the country and the ... states yeah we were in trouble but\nKavanaugh the calculation by the Democrats the I'm willing to give Kavanaugh fair shot it did not sit well with folks it backfired on them now we have the caravan thing going on Trump is turning it into a political issue Eric you're right\nUm it it ... it started as something that Democrats thought that would benefit them it is not benefiting them if that chord\nGets to the border and tries to come across and Trump\nPrevents that we are going to gain points in the polls ... and and that's the way it looks to me okay without taking my partisan hat off that just the way it looks to me while while when Trump is if we're talking about cap and all are we're talking about\nThings like this we're winning and you guy the the topic is change it was a referendum on Trump\nAnd you guy the the topic is change it was a referendum on Trump now is to do for a referendum and you lose your losing\nThis but we are ... ... as if I were political strategist we run out of steam three weeks before the election never a good situation for us to be in your optics optics which put capital of his thoughts were moment of this immigration thing is is is really one of Trump's you just break from the\nHis own religious feelings about that he rallies the troops around now the Democrats have run out of rallying cries right now the anti Trump sentimental but we're still there doesn't seem to be manifesting itself\nIn your play is to help Trump messes it up at the border and maybe there's enough aggressive\nAnd there's enough heightened to come to the polls a blood that runs out after a while once you've got something else to maintain it um but I think Trump is going to be smart enough now to\nTo play the immigration thing out three weeks the issue he faces is not overplay comes Dover plight if you're a suggestion for his point about the military and interesting catch twenty two\nExtra military down there are a much bruises completely correct is really for just ... you need the help sure there's nothing else in the military can do it yourself this sounds good visual but it's that's the point\nAnd it also that message get into central and South American the American military and they don't know the technicalities rules all they know is the federal Easter or there\nBut the only thing you could do technically walk your arms shot [laughter] you don't just stand on the border and walk you're on knocked all\nRight so tonight on television all across the country they're going to show scenes of what happened a couple of hours ago where the horde of people tried to cross and break down the fence in on the border between a Guatemala and Mexico and the reaction is going to be what\nWords are too many outrageous also gonna meet are we next and I tell you where this message is playing very very well in Mexico city the new Mexican president which we thought was going to be a radical leftists\nThis guy shrewd he's probably one of the smarter ones they've had down there as a failed president say he has heard the president's message about Yankee dollars in trade and I'll just tear up this new agreement if you don't do something on your end to control your border\nAnd I think he's getting the message because they're mobilizing the Mexican federal police now say more to get on their south\nAnd they can but but they need to be more concerned about their other boarders that's where they're supposed to stop the immigration\nHope they stop at the south border down to the Yucatan then they don't have to worry about the northern border down at the Yucatan now they're down the Guatemalan border and the horror\nJust tried to break down the fence and you have Mexican police that are beating them back and that's when everybody asks the unsettled\nPlaying all the Mexicans has to do is shut down the railroads there is an interstate highways down there they can't just get on a on the interstate and Yucatan city and drive a real\nFoot band politically speaking horrible we're in a bad this is not good for for Democrats good\nSo good good good so I see a you know I think we've done a great job or we've been fortunate again I'd say I've never ran for mayor we're fortunate ... you know we mess that you've got the advantage you got the wind you all messed up the Democrats messed up we now taking in fact\nWe've got three weeks ago hopefully nobody interferes with do we get the house Democrats were in the house I I still think you get the house because there are so many\nUm Democrat advantages that you have and it's only I count right now you need twenty three seats jak\nAccounts Fifteen you already have ... have Fifteen you've got locked okay that only leaves eight more to go in about thirty five or forty in play here and I think it's very likely ... and she was a lot of things that we can't ... I wasn't\nHere last week either ... or looked at five twenty eight and I did notice ... this was the counter to your Kavanaugh effect\nActually the the enthusiasm gap went up a point for Democrats or work for several point five point five and I don't know why I asked her I don't know why that was true but ... the enthusiasm for Republicans win of double digit yeah but I don't know why the ... uh five twenty age gap went up a at a at the same time I I was looking at that I was curious if\nBoth sides were energized the differences y'all were all ready energized I said I don't feel\nThe right I think that's why Cruz has gone from a ... point deficit in Harris County to all the ... album stream of\nThem so I'll just since you love it's five thirty at least since you left five thirty eight they've got an eighty four and a half percent chance five and ... which is really going on which has gone out of Democrats winning the house\nBut they have a Twenty one percent orange Seventy eight percent chance of Republicans winning more seats in the Senate seven out of nine\nWhat's your pre school rounded don't tell me what the enthusiasm gap or you know\nWhen they don't they don't have that you there's an eight point advantage in the generic can read out of it out well both and Trump's popularity the discrepancy nationwide it's been affected in forever I don't think it's ... very much\nAnd not have to move their words for you or you might on the ... uh five thirty I\nBelieve that if it gets to wells\nIt's slips both houses\nIt's not going to get but it won't get up and who else no ...
