going on everybody I Know I'm here and it's a kids' school with our lives but ... ... ... so it's changed everybody sees that everybody's names\nBut uh I think we have to change or a warfare tactics so to speak and um there was a bit out there it's just so I'm ... and it says oh what a billion Christians\nAnd starting to generate a lot of support and the reason is I'm fighting with conventional methods against a liberal or social is we're not getting anywhere\nSo good people are saying hey we have to do something that we do something better you know we can get yourself a gentleman in a a a courteous to people and things like that is clearly they let's go to work\nYeah anyway we are way but I think\nHe referred to something that that we we know is the ... even ... went to Donald Trump\nDonald Trump never been a big evangelical person but what happens I think America and the evangelicals realized someone is good and it's kind is Mitt Romney was absolutely trashed and destroyed by these monsters and they don't care\nSo they tend to listen we need somebody to fight back I think America over the last well let me say a lot of conservatives or whatever so they are and we won that battle and we're doing now and everything seems to be no we're not even close to being done\nYou're absolutely right and they need to get fired up and remember these people are not going to relinquish power freely ... will will use whatever tactic necessary to destroy anyone who gets in their way of power so in other words\nWe're not done vote and we're not done being activated and we're not done rallying the troops if you will because this was a proverbial war of ideology and these people on the left they have proven just like you said they will lie cheat steal do whatever they can destroy anyone who gets in their way\nAnd the ... as if you weren't evangelical your Christian understand your way of life is under attack in this country by those people\nAbsolutely you know what I honestly believe it was Christian gentleman was all volunteer work towards family or that's what this country great in the first place and people were taken for granted\nAnd then when the uh just suggest that people um take a look at that a billboard says Cohen a billion Christians 'cause it's cold or a billion Christians to pray for the lord or on\nEaster Sunday twenty twenty and there was a a thing but that was\nA bright star ... older people to check that out is that I think we're so here we have to change the fact that\nYou know I think well I Know I think we saw what unfortunately needs to be done thank you for the call Jim appreciate it I appreciate the kind words as well I think you're right when you say we have to change their tactics clearly the Mitt Romney tactic the ... and even as much as I Love Ted Cruz and we see how much more of a fighter reinforced he's always fought for us\nUm she wants to make published fall stuff into stories you want to move the two point nine million dollars each out there it's just a matter of where the people are willing to litigate it and then when it comes to public figures\nIt's a little more difficult and his anyone going to be willing to go after and press charges are these people that signed these documents under oath claiming one thing I I just don't know do you think we should pass a digital additional legislation to try to curb some of the stuff\nWell I'm not exactly sure what the law on the books aren't maybe just to force the law I mean you know it look you can't be just going out there it'd be like me saying something about you know maybe one of the senator from New Jersey something to eat at about maybe Fifteen Years ago that might not be true but it may be true\nAnd are they going to go after him or maybe you know somebody I don't know it's just um [noise] I just don't I just don't get it I'm I'm a little older and I just don't get it I you know you say something bad about somebody you better be able to back it up if your kid back it up there you know either don't say it or be prepared\nTo face the consequences which would be slander which shows but I don't know\nYou know what are you know I mean what do you think I'm ...\nI mean when I I think you're right on a couple of levels which is I agree with you I tend to be a little bit more old fashioned I'm leaving due process and I believe if you go and say something unsubstantiated you need to be able to back it up and if you don't you need to be prepared to get smacked upside the head by the court if you will\nBut that being said understand when you're talking about laws on the books being enforced we have almost a virtually entirely\nYou can set understand when you talk about laws on the books being enforced we have almost a virtually entire Democratic Party that wants that were used as refuses to enforce federal immigration laws they will ignore them\nOkay just 'cause they don't like them and they will only follow the laws that they want to follow and then they want to pass the laws for the rest of us that we have to follow thinking about this they claim they want an open border basically\nThe Democrats want to open up the borders get rid of them on California and in Arizona and New Mexico and Texas of course right here and want to open up this border we know for those of us who pay attention\nThere were thousands of people coming to horrible ends in Mexico they're being shot in my high powered weaponry they're being blown up they're having their heads cut off their hacked in pieces by these monsters that are in the cartels\nAnd those borders would be wide open for those people because they virtually are at this point not completely wide open but they would open up to that but these same people that are actively working to limit your ability to be able to defend yourself with the second amendment\nYou want to know why I call this an ideological war that is why the very same people who want to disarm you are the same people that are willing to open up our country to the most vicious monsters we've ever known and they don't think twice about it because they don't follow the laws that they want us to follow anyway\nI think it was called in property she hated this is why it's so important for us to vote on not just venting here I'm trying to make you understand how important it is we get

FBI file on Kavanaugh\nThe latest in ... inquiry investigation\nYou understand he's now been investigated by the FBI seven times\n[noise] seven times they've investigated this man found nothing yet it's not good enough for Democrats\nYeah these are the same people\nWell I just don't go home a danger if I'll stop right there these are the same people that well there's there's just not enough\nDuring a press conference this morning Chuck Schumer said the fears that the FBI would be limited from getting all the facts in their investigation I've been realized and we said we knew this was going to happen we said they're just gonna lay when it comes to week it's not enough time we need more time\nThat's all they're doing their delaying delaying into like the good thing is Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley said\nIt's time to develop over closure tomorrow offer those of you may be watching on the Facebook page KGB am seven hundred the voice of taxes I put a poll on the video\nAnd you go to like the page case to be a um seven hundred divorce taxes like that page when you watch the video you can roll your mouse over the video boom the poll pops up will judge be confirmed tomorrow well we'll see\nWe don't know who's going to vote when we're ... we will see it looks like I think all the Democrats are against\nIt in this in other words this meant nothing to them they don't care they're just simply trying to ... I Wonder before we get to the phones I Want to make sure that I we talk about this us weekly job claims dropped joined near forty nine year low\nNow what are the Democrats are so mad more America they see their grip on power slipping by the minute the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits ... forty nine year low this week\nYet somehow the same people who does the Trump was elected that's the time he was going to crash the exact opposite happened and now they're trying to figure out how to give credit to Morocco Obama\nThe data pointed to sustain labor market strength which should continue to under pan economic growth initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped eight thousand to a seasonally adjusted two hundred and seven thousand for the week of September twenty ninth according to the Labor Department\nThis may have something to do with why the daily tracking poll according to Rasmussen shows President Trump at fifty percent approval right now\nGoing to\nVote on the radio on your own voice which actually I\nMean we guys you guys are ours on fire today a lot of really good calls today and I appreciate these well thought out phone calls I mean you guys have been fantastic\nBecause we're talking about well I guess to boil it down on the response or public and today or this FBI cabin on file sharing the Democrats is an ideological war\nWar we are their enemy and you are not a Democrat you're an enemy of them are Democrats are this way but the ones in power are\nI Know people that are Democrats that are perfectly good decent people problem is the low crazy\nThey vote for people who don't even represent their values and I talked to another woman I'm not changing their mind or there's a lot of people that are any political well they're hashtags walking away from the Democratic party look as they're saying now\nIt's nothing but our and that's all they want they want to delayed delayed do way more delight to nothing but substantiated allegations still want more investigation all they're doing is trying to push Pat Summitt terms because they're hoping to pick up seats and then they get pushed past them in terms\nThey probably would can Republicans would get smoke for an intimate terms\nRight now we don't know we'll we'll have to wait and see our two one five five eight can see me to a one size I made five seven three eight here's something else a lot of people are going to go back to the song and just a second\nDuring chairman Grassley press comments earlier he talked about the protesters that came to his office I'm against cabin on some for Kavanaugh\nYou talked about the media and he was addressing them he said I'm never going to call you guys fake news I told them fake news all the time\nBut they're biased and he's absolutely right he says the protesters that were for Kavanaugh how to talk to the media not in the media wanting to interview them they don't want to talk to them and they only want to talk to those protesting against Kavanaugh is that not biased\nHeat is biased in this ever been in the media\nIs the last Dharma the Democrat Party there's a left wing that's all they are they are propaganda\nAnd they tried to Blake it in this cool objective those little bottles in there and they're not they're not even remotely your check is there a bunch of Democrats and that's why they do what they do and they're trying to as well I hate Trump because he calls them out for what they are oh man today to\nOur let's go to the phones to a one size five eight five seven to ... let's forget what the phantom who's been patiently holding have phantom all come to the voice of Texas\nWhat's that ... are you doing this oh I'm good how are you saying some pretty darn good that could give you a civics lessons what oh All right let me give me a lesson\nYou now you know me a long time you know on borderline genius so I'm\nGoing to ask you know when we started in the past you idiot savant ... I mean without the salon part so yeah\nI'll take that as a compliment\nUsing those big words you know so anyway\nUm uh when I was going to say is going to ask you a question his constitutional duty is it your pick Supreme Court justices\nWhose constitutional duty is to vote or to to be like to nominate\nYour point is\nYou know it's just that that is right and explain to me why Merrick Garland a lot on the Supreme Court you don't have to answer it or you know the reason why I bring it up because they made it\nUm your key Merrick Garland off the off the court and it was a job I was so called real it was never enforced basically after the contentious here I Am Clarence Thomas Joe Biden\nCame out and said look in an election year you're going to appoint anybody or or you know suggested he might be you can't do it in an election year or do you do it it has to be somebody that is more leaning towards the the\nOther party you know and Merrick Garland is a moderate\nYou know he was definitely in the middle of the road but I'm Mitch McConnell refused to even bring him to the floor but now I'm going to ask you a Republican to Democrat\nOr clearly right now the Democrats\nNow it's the Republicans' ears why they knew there was a chance that I'm\nHillary Clinton might lose an election they knew it was very and they knew that it was highly unlikely that she was going to lose but there was just like I'm a dollar so you're saying that the chance\nAnd what was the Democrats were full of themselves sure that a Hillary was that they did not hard enough American darn when they didn't fight hard enough when they knew what was going to get to pick 'em anyway\nYour shorts in is which is typical of the last I gotta I gotta have it now there's an old saying you can get rich slow getting rich quick is very difficult I like the ... and here's a short sighted they had they\nHad a lot of ... on the Supreme Court Obama would have replaced and that's how short\nSighted in don't they are so my point being is fear and you're\nOkay you're not getting the other day and I'm actually there to get the votes there is no way they voted out of college or are they not had the votes they are\nThan will be a lot of calls to get to them they really call a good little civics lesson I'll say this you know I didn't think the Republicans were ruthless I Would just say the Democrats were far more ruthless and also stand by that but what they do you talk about the viral absolutely they enforce that in the last the it's the lame duck rule basically you're a lame duck president if they're not going to allow though [noise]\nI go on and on about this but you made a really good point to roll that not that you were wrong on anything you you said\nYou go back and look at the wake of devastation and how many Democrats have lost in Harris County is getting a lot of Democrats want throughout the rest of the country they have been for lack of a better term Lauderdale elections left and right over and over and over again over the last few years Obama's one of the best thing to chat on the Republican as far as\nOver and over again over the last few years Obama's one of the best thing that's happened the Republicans as far as well voting wise and he tried to destroy the country in the process it's not as bad as you think but you made some really good points I mean I could do a whole show on that are actually call let's go to Pamela in oak forest stakes are hanging on Pamela welcome to the voice of Texas\nOh hi how are you I'm good how are you I'm just fine um\nWhat one person called St Louis I call brilliant\nPoint anyway I call to make the point I think he\nKind of laid it that if the Democrats that we see in here from on that last\nYou know that you left ... now and then he gets around labor all kinds of people every day and\nI don't see any that craziness they actually had you know crazed uh intelligent discussion they really listen to each other but one thing I'm trying to convince the or in my family and it a lot of older people that I did with my parents for uncle id across the street\nThey just can't believe out by I mean it is and I tell them\nThat they're not going to change they don't care they had you can't shame on her they don't care so don't worry about it but you have to look at it this fight every day did consenting Donald Trump and all the things that they tried to do at that got the power to the mainstream media and he's still won\nIt by Hollywood despite everything he still one son who has the power or\nThe parents will have no power and very you know we've already out there and don't even think of that change who cares\nYeah and that's not if you went to the twenties you got the right attitude because you're absolutely right because you just go in thinking listen they're not going to change doesn't matter what we do so what you do I get you get yourself active in and get involved they give us a call me and leverage you to get active it involved and you jump in you're absolutely right you take your destiny in your own hands don't fit back\nSo you're absolutely right and and I you know would you agree with that point you made about\nSuddenly go ruthless cause more you're absolutely right he's Republicans Mitch McConnell there very long term thinking there look in the way ahead in the future what's going on and it's you don't want to pay back time if you will or at least try to get one more call in before we have to take the next break let's go to Cody listening in Tom Wolfe Tony thanks for hanging on hold them to the voice from Texas\nThey've started on the number of duty how're you\nDoing good it it it it was\nAnother one the Chinatown on a different idea but um basically you know you can kind of see what the landscape politics right now I'm really like I start to wonder why the in our two party system was created to begin with because really it's set up to be a divisive active or\nLife is not going to let me really actually hold on August ... when it gets our country and to go\nTo the limit you it wasn't designed to be a two party system there's been multiple parties we've had the wigs we've had all different kinds of parties evolved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd they ah ... ah McConnell's sided Schumer's rule you said a a you know we're not supposed to ah no no president should be allowed to nominate a Supreme Court justice during his final year in office and said yeah that sounds good to us and so they didn't bring him up for vote in it and furious that the Democrats\nAnd so in an act of revenge they moved to filibuster Neil Gorsuch\nYeah and that's when McConnell\nIt is only a clear option and change the rules for fifty one votes for Supreme Court justices and so if the Democrats have attacked yellow straw to they still have the filibuster\nFor Supreme Court nominees but they don't and soldiers desperation and we're going to watch them play out during the cabin I erase\nIs their own fault and you know I say tough I think the guy's going to get a like you got to get a voted in the camp stopping\nAnd what we've seen I think it's pretty dangerous for the Republican or it's you know the scorched earth policy this despicable character assassination how you got to get people to step forward to serve in government if this is what they're going to do to you\nKnow and it's they are the call Bob good points I don't you know and you guys are doing a better show than I Am I only have to show your good points\nAnd the reality is and you point out something very astute and the Democrats they're the ones that didn't they're the ones doing the underhanded tactics better they run around talking about how there for\nYou know an equal opportunity but they're the biggest racist we know and the other ones are talked about well you know a women's rights and look at Hollywood all of these predators they're all they're all Democrats who didn't Bill Clinton\nCivil war on women everything they can use the other side of doing they're the ones that are the most guilty of it so\nThe reality is what as you pointed out what's good for the goose\nIs good for the gander\nIt's amazing are you guys hanging on the phones I Want to get into this rock and roll and go to the next break this document store and they will come back and take your calls wrap up today show um\nPersonal information of these three Republicans have been posted on the Internet according to Capitol police last week Democrats staffer on Capitol Hill been charged with identifying information about Republican senators and putting it out\nOf this guy is Jackson a Costco twenty seven years old and he's an intern for Sheila Jackson Lee\nOkay this guy's been arrested

and said they're cooperating with law enforcement\nLegion jail and these are the when I say the Democrats are more ruthless\nAnd more nefarious the Democrats are the ones that are doc seeing people the Democrats are the ones that are showing up at restaurants and shouting at people the Democrats are the ones marching on Capitol Hill screaming there's going to be war in the streets if you don't vote against Kavanaugh\nAnd the Democrats are the ones who are going to be United against Kavanaugh\n... at once again I'm not seeing the Republicans are you know can be equally as ruthless but it's pretty clear in this time day and age let's Cory Booker Senate right and he meant it\nThese people don't care they're going to vote for him this was they stole tactic older doing was trying to stall long enough to come up with some kind of dirt so that they can absolutely denied this guy from getting appointed so then they can hopefully hang on to that power\nGet through the midterms pick up a seat or two and prevent Donald Trump from nominating anymore can they I think at this point everybody understands everybody's time is limited but especially when you're talking about Ruth Bader
