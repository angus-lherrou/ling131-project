apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign and then you have that story or you have what ... since he was spending it as and\nHere's some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\nDo power line had a great ... a rite of of this and I think that again it's not a whisper\nCampaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there is German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or the operative\nAnd that he was a because of his association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in his laments that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is totalitarian state\nAnd that he was bitterly opposed to their approach to the state of Israel and he backed out he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know we backed Palestinian cause he treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nSo we know that that's not even up for debate I Can't I actually have the tweet saved so he thought that was from his Twitter account so\nAnd the center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much caution being used and drawing conclusions about all of this because the intel establishment I just don't trust some of the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're bad writing I don't know if that's off it is but here's the thing if he was a middle aged operative wind the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\nIn the New York times this is what I'm powerless I noted the New York times about cars showed him\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nDuring the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing columns to the Washington Post and asks why would oppose enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself I contributing columns\nThe New York times describes him as a quote political Islamic to quote forged a personal bond with President rod type aired on of turkey why would the post to use as a columnist and Islamic pal of ear to one\nAnd New York times also added that according to cause showed you don't friends he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood\nThey said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledge that he quote remains um conversant in a conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that we're saying that by the way that wasn't and I have the link destroy right here at the Rand just on the fourteenth so that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that the New York times to their credit legit asking some questions or or\nPutting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this guy\nAnd I think that's a good question why would they hire him\nAnd just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince wrote a couple of columns by some duty to in life and decided to kill him\nI mean look look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue I've just really don't believe that they did\nAnd if Joe why would he go to this drastic\nTake drastic undertaking and bill just links to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the dang consulate\nDistant did did he goes to the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey in general and then you have what are your other who's always with you know the crown prince he goes in there shortly after\nThat pretty brazen now you could\nShortly after that\nPretty worried that now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he had gone on the charm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I think I\nI Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo a particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugs it off but\nI think that after the charm offensive there's more than than just he's you know punch drunk on power there's\nMore to it than that because you don't go to this you don't go to this is the fact that this length go all over the United states and you know show how you're really getting\nA unveiling reforms women are driving\nYour rolling back some of your your other regulations on you know said Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support a at the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world in that region that huge\nSo why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like that was there a sense of urgency where's there's something else happening\nI mean that's one of the world led to that and I think that's a good question\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was the New York times that we're saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nNew York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they weren't a profile of me I actually like the report I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local not jobs who tried to do pieces on me and end up writing fan thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nUm but they're not even though they're biased and they make mistakes\nI don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was the worst that's it and they're not a conservative publication so power\nThat that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in the way of asking the bigger questions why would the\nCrown prince gamble all of everything that he has built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe in the New York times had written that he wasn't as long as he was just as the what the Muslim Brotherhood and he was apparently working to have an Islamic all set up a authored authoritarian state to replace the Saudi monarchy\nI mean is that what it was I think it's legitimate to ask these types of questions and that's why it comes into play\nWe're going to talk to Dr ... about the next hour because this is his wheel house and I'm like I said I just think that there's there's something more there\nSo and then what happens if it turns out yeah that it was you know the Saturday did it and not only did they do it with the crown prince apparently knew of it then then what happens most of the thoughts on that as well so we have all of that still to touch on and uh we will in the meantime Cal Tech is a\nSorry for em you\nForce or [noise]\nSalary from town hall in downtown lines down

R. E. S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old wishes he was five years but the designation kind of runs from baby boomers I needed a little bit earlier people who are just thinking about things like downsizing\nAll the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot more planning family conference saying things like that that go on them or the typical sale and it was a big gay because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nI see now according to its very definition seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate need as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting in early\nBecause that's been real estate basically ask for different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation of property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the ten it increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage three is cash flow rent better\nFigure that out in the pre ... so in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early\nMhm to be a first time that gesture in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps look at things like we each real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchased itself\nYou know that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have begun sees you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that she believed that real estate goes appreciation\nLiterally it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate\nGoes appreciation generates cash flow\nWhich it has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out with hundreds of other people buying larger block investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice for your if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that you can read great benefits in the years I have\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and we used to northern Virginia area has averaged about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area three percent\nA year ...\nSo if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth unemployment on track [noise] there's no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nPeter we still have so much more to talk about and I'd like to really drill down on your for wage real estate can generate income can you join us again in the next hour\nRelative to their absolutely more than happy to join you\nThank you Peter Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with Macedonia associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia [noise]\nComing up on real estate today when you sell a property have you ever thought about holding the notes that strategy and much more straight ahead on our special show retiring as well [noise]\nIf you love listening to talk about real estate join the conversation [noise]\nReal estate to the radio on faith he can't wait to hear from you\nThat's what they did a radio I think [noise]\nImagine your dream carpet you know from ... office all inclusive installation on the minimum person under Ninety nine dollars sending\nBasically furniture moving and stares free coffee one comes with the price of words that\nWe carpeted insulation actually for the Home Depot or saving more to do and\nThat's the only one ... one dollar more forthright way especially Adams maybe if I was a number of available at home before the complex license summers\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if we go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win", "show_name": "Chris Salcedo Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "21"}
