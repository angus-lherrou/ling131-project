buyers out there there are many homes for sale and prices are on the rise and so our mortgage interest rates so the buyers who are putting their signature on offers must be really determined to get a house\nYou're absolutely right or based on on the latest um closed sales figures which we released the this past week obviously sales are declining to go to a point a law that was driven by shortage of inventory the headwinds as you'll clearly stated\nAnd that's where your Halloween my first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAlways always ... it has always scary scary than\nBut also want to know I'm a move in front of into the air\nToo so what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happens it's also the last day of October so like many communities are less than a month as a very popular day for clothing with ... on homeownership and and so as people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America PEPFAR about buying a home but it's a little bit scary to them should it be\nBefore I bought a home I got home ownership but it's scary to me any repair or anything that might have to have a new house it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for some of those ongoing payments\nAnd you know real ... that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with those experts in the neighborhood the plumber and the electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear can sometimes not everybody has those connections and they need to I cannot make\nThose we make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but it's your house and you can maintain it so you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely and and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits is now it's your home and you can do what you want you with it and you can add on deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy that house for some people that just terrifies I'm\nSure that's one of the very first things is going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about the mortgage process and you know men in the world Trade Center and recommend some lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is\nYou know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't payment and how to manage that process but it's their long term payments and if you're investing in you\nKnow you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and invest in yourself in someone else\nAnother thing was year isn't some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that\nPart of one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those are financial resources the best way to build wealth to have the freedom to do what you want to do is to own that home\nIt's an investment in yourself and your future and so um it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point dove rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\n... I mean certainly you want to check with your local realtor find out about the community there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know and people want to continue to move and home owners today\nAlso become traveler and a renter and property for a vacation stays though you get to have the benefit of both\nHere's a tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nThat's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market is different and every market has recovered differently\nIt is important to have a conversation 'cause every market and different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes and lending\nThat are going to help mitigate that for the future so there had been some rules and regulations and and that and put in place to try to avoid that which will help our home buyers and that that you want to talk to your local wrote to her about\nThe condition of the area where you're considering the by whether it's their first home or in second home you know our prices increasing the inventory low or high you know that will give you more of a sense of a long term lesson picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things and they buy their own house we need to remind them that one of the most compelling things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nIt's what everybody wants to do at the end of the day when you're tired when you're sided you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate the company memory get to celebrate birthdays and dinners\nAnd you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters who come to your door and and the costumes and the fun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great thing about this week\nWe're happy Halloween was the only other men than all the EEO of re max boerio view in Columbia, Missouri and the president of the national association of reassures [noise]\nComing up on real estate very just saving tens\nThousands of dollars for a down payment scares you you might be in for a nice surprise\nEligible for somewhere between ... programs and an average down payment set up to cut those programs without writing two hundred dollars coming up on our special show scary thing [noise]\nBut first it's time for ads the millennial [noise]\nThe millennials are the biggest demographic group in America and potentially\nThe biggest group of homeowners ever\nSo let's talk real estate now with a genuine member of the millennial generation joining us as our own Jane ... dream high fever and thanks for having me we're so glad you're here so Jane what do you have for us today\nWell even it officially fall and that means one thing in my family\nAs I mentioned before Halloween is my husband's favorite holiday and he already has the house decorated the pumpkin carving and we have multiple costumes ready for a dog we couldn't decide between football pop or doctor dog sofa\nAnd apparently we aren't the only ones that go all out for Halloween according to a study by the Eighteenth bank millennials out than every other generation on Halloween two to one\nWe will spend an average of that hundred and eighty dollars on candy costumes decorations and other random digit death\nWe love our creepy costumes and decor so as a new homeowner\nI wanted to talk about the back and said this ways to prepare your home for Halloween 'cause there's no reason Halloween can't be scary and safe sounds great Jane let's hear first for your jak lanterns or for our friends using paper lanterns you've LAPD candles instead of actual candle\nOpen flames are just a fire waiting to happen and candles these days are not only have they also look like the real thing plus they have candles that change colors now so let's go\nNext to the American Academy of pediatrics number one piece of advice for homeowners is to keep front porches debts and yard clear and anything a child can tripped over but that garden hose away sweet those leaves off to that and that front yard graveyard ... events around it\nBut actually injuries or tripping and falling of her staff are the most common Halloween injury so do your part keep trick or treaters trick or treating and keep your current clear that's a great idea jak finally at a public service announcement on behalf of all children out there I said it to all adults you know actual candy\nNo one wants freedom press all\nKids look forward to this day all year because of chocolate and not orange like\nJane would you care for a box for instance you're part of the problem Steve and be part of the early ...
