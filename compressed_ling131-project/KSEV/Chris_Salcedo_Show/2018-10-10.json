fan of taking care of our fire department\nBecause these people also put their lives on the line for us looks like they're working towards parity paying now according to this report on ABC Thirteen it looks like the campaign against it has been funded by the mayor and the police union\nWell and that may be the case say but my position has been from the beginning that it's bad policy to have the public decide the compensation packages city employees that it's um it it really than the mayor and and the union\nThey should have been negotiated before we got to this point\nI you know I think you're right and I saw that the mayor\nSaid he offered something like a nine percent raised to the end I Know they just have their big debate I think it was over the weekend but offered like a nine percent raised to the the fire department but apparently it's not good enough for them and and now we're seeing this issue where they're going back and forth and then you've got it looks like a mayor and the police department or the union\nThat are going there campaigning against is it just sounds like it's bad from the get go\nWell it is because we are going to end up doing is what it sounds like to me at least what we've been advised by legal and others is this is going to end up trying the police department to the fire department on any future raises and that's where the opposition from the police comes in at least a union and so it it just it just um\nIf you're trying to sell your home when you're looking for the best look no further than Ronnie and Kathy Matthews at ... legends there

by five eight K. F. C. V. pickup was Brittany listening into ball Brittany thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey how are you I'm good how are you reading great now um\nI was listening in and um I just it it's sickening just because my not only in my father he's been firefighter but says my has then sell 'em this whole entire situation is unsettling just because of the fact that\nThe reason why the HIV has turned down wages in the past is because of the fact that they um had a good pension plan well now the tension is gone completely away\nNot completely away that has been pretty much you know lost money on it and now there with the same exact salary so that's where I think the\nTension has banner that confusion or whatever with everyone you know you know looking at it and now I'm even though this has been going on for a couple of years now so\nThat's very good point a lot of people don't know that in ... when you're talking about\nWe we saw what's happening with the city and then the money and one of the big problems ahead during the Parker administration was you know a certain point where the city has been hemorrhaging money and all of a sudden you're right that we got this\nThe pension plans for the firefighters and stuff like this was going away yet she was able to somehow just without telling anyone just rounded up money in that budget and start offering same sex\nPartners benefits through ... so\nThat kinda stuff and and now we got another liberal Democrat running things over the city which was mayor Turner I'd like him a whole lot more than I like mayor park actually early on I like the ... the nights\nBut the I became very bitter and ... you have nothing but anonymity towards I'm Sorry animosity towards the people who voted for her\nSo at least at least may return it seems like he loves the city and he wants to he's trying to do the best they can we'll we'll see what he does but and I know people that are also members of the the HIV and my lord and it's it's not like it was just a few years ago their\nFlight was not only that HIV backed up Turner whenever he got elected because he said that he wasn't going to do anything to the pension and now\nMore than ... did and that's a good thing for the call Britney appreciated ... I'm sure that's once again these are ... I didn't even think about that I completely forgot about it for the study it as closely as as others which clearly you guys are a let's go to John holding it east Houston John thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nA grid how you doing today\nI Am good how are you John\nI'm good yes Brittany just brought up one of the biggest star the city of Houston is facing several billion dollars in retirement liabilities not only the fire department police department but across the city wide public service the whole works\nThey several years ago\nThey negotiate a deal with ... with H eighty two for them to put more into their retirement and they would pay rate a chip the didn't go with that they decided to heat or try to maintain the engine they add an intern they didn't get no pay raises\nThis has been going all the way back to them and whip Maher was the mayor in fact it got so bad last\nYear if you remember we had an election about at the state\nThe state legislature threatened to get involved with the retirement problems with the city of Houston and the last minute last minute wheeling and dealing Turner was able to ... is way out so that the state legislature stayed out of it\nYou know I completely forgot about that you're right on I remember now that you're you're bringing something I completely forgot about that showdown that when you write mayor Turner's time we got out of the last second and didn't it didn't go this way but then here we are today and we're still facing the same issues acceptance further down the road and even worse\nYes and I am a retired firefighter not from the sea is from an adjacent city\nI Know you take for instance a starting a fire fighter in the city of Dallas makes twice what a starting firefighter makes in the city of Houston and that's just one and\nI don't know I I'm not going to get in on equal pay whether H. A. D. should be paid the same or should they be tied together that's something that needs to be worked out that there is some the dirt on this retirement issue and the city liabilities\nThey got two hundred and five million dollars recently for new bike trails and they're getting ready to build another park in downtown Houston\nBut they're cutting and freezing services they're cutting they're freezing the pay they talking about they're going to have to lay off people you know it's just the same old common scare tactics\nWell this this is on the tail end when Hurricane Harvey here this last year I remember mayor attorneys say listen we're going to have to raise taxes unless we can get some of that state money and he got fifty was a billion dollars from the states\nTo help out over here the governor came through that are willing to give that money so you don't have to raise taxes he got that money and turn right around a week later and said\nI got to raise taxes in Houston city council had to vote against him to stop it because he didn't want to ...\nYeah ... ... that kind of things for the call John appreciate it that that kind of stuff is what we see some Democrats on a regular basis\nHe planned but I we don't get this money I'm going to have to raise taxes he was going to raise taxes on the standing of Houston after was orderly devastated and I mean a lot of the city was utterly Deborah I'm One of those people that lost my home because of the flood of unfortunately I'd insurance I\nWas good enough to lucky enough to get it as a good enough and it was luck lucky enough to have it because there's not that expensive so I had it so I was able to recover from Hurricane Harvey\nBut then mayor Turner was like yeah we're going to have to raise taxes in order to inform all this to make sure everything gets covered and we're going to do this and because we're we need to really get state money and the only way we can do it so then again like fifty billion dollars from Governor Greg Abbott and in turn run around still tried to raise taxes on it\nThere you're you're right there's a lot of people you know what I'm I'm I'll just reach out to some more Republicans and people in city hall maybe I'll reach out to ... I Know my Knoxville reach out to my see what he has to say\nIt's ... it's a heavy issue and you're right there was a lot to it and you know what now that you mentioned around me right I've heard you calling in previous programs in other shows talking about this\nYou clearly pay far more attention than a lot of people are doing things for the call always good to hear from your up thinking of doing one five five eight can see me let's go to Jim listening in seeing what Tim thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHi thanks for taking my call a couple of things there's three page in the city used and and the ... pension and the police pension\nOr got got promised a I always use in their pension and the fire departments pension all at the cash payments that's where the problem of the city uh he's he's been addicted the mayor's vindictive towards is uh we've had one race I'm a firefighter Twenty years\nWe've had one race two thousand level three percent right two thousand Fifteen at the same song and dance so they're going to lay you off if they don't like all the young we're better\nOff if you don't take this essay for six or eight percent and their insurance goes up five and a half percent so yeah we're we're financing\nOur ornate if we did take it or ... and also with our oil three hundred and fifty part butter sauce chose not to take that ray it keeps talking about it not only five raise that he offered ...\nPiece of paper where that race was offered every eating and the collective bargaining sessions was radio it's people can look at it the first city says where we collected bark and we have no money to give you all\nAnd then after several slip by labor down to four or five other item and they still couldn't agree on any kind of raid in the city got up and walked out like that one you know I felt pretty I got you know I look at this so it made it a feta stuff\nYou know it went to court it can collect the Oregon State law has to do the courts to judge it keeps saying if I ever was offered ever going to start early ... person probably can maybe she doesn't know disinformation\nI I mean it's just politics at its worst\nYeah that kind of drove up the wall today is my first time the river into so ... obviously I'm going to be looked more into this but they called him I appreciated I you know what's funny is I've heard the mayor said he offered there's nine point five percent raise I haven't heard anybody else say it\nAnd that means that I Know because a previous caller said before used in firefighters get paid\nNothing close to like with Dallas Fort Worth yet with these other major cities gadgets ah there are five hundred they get paid a lot more now I understand it all boils down to we're talking about money here\nNot necessarily the ... and I agree with what the other caller said about should they get paid exactly the same as police and I I think they built from the city proudly and thank God for it and they should be it should be relatively close in my my opinion but once you and you start dealing with pensions and people making promises and\nThen all of a sudden your pension gets flipped and\nThere's a whole is basically what I'm hearing and I'm sure I'm going to hear more about this as we go through the show there's a whole lot of balls being juggling balls are dropping left and right and it looks like nobody wants to take responsibility for them\nAnd the problem is you know the eating it he's from fire department right now let's go to mark in West used in marketing for ... the motion Texas\nThanks grip um I I don't know if this was substantiated but back when the first came up and they had both represent a fire department also police department\nUm I'm a Christmas show in the morning and and from what I understand is not so much how it was for the parity that they approached it from that and rather than just heritage for other firefighters and others city\nInstead of ... exact naturally say with the police department saying they should be paid to the same amount as a police policemen for the same number of years and all that\nAnd they said well that's not the way it is in other cities and they didn't want to get into an argument about which is more dangerous and I'm going to get the jobs that it on what job positions are you talking about that with ... ... and all that but they jumped straight from parity of of firefighters in other cities\nShoe parity with actual police officers and and it's from what I understand it no major city is that does that exists where the uh the fire department is paid the same age as as far as a police done for the same number of years of experience\nYeah you know and that that's a good point you bring up from what I was I was watching a special on the other day on the news the news a portion on it\nAnd they were saying that's roughly what they're doing is you're right there looking at parity with some of these other cities these major cities but the ones in the other major cities I guess it's relative to the police departments it's a whole lot closer compared to what ours are on the scene of Houston apparently there's a huge discrepancy between our city doing our police officers in our firefighters compared\nTo say Dallas Fort Worth who's or pay far closer each other and also not to mention far more than what they're getting paid here in Houston so I think it's the it's Mitt inter related\n\nOr will they give us a call I appreciate and Mark Mehos we got to take another break and when we come back in his will get the David and Willie and trying to wrap up today show this is a big issue women and it's not going to be resolved on this program and it's not I haven't fortunately I don't think it will be resolved\nOnce again this started well before this seems to me [noise] I\nYou don't build them become a firefighter police officer for the past\nYou don't feel to become a firefighter a police officer for the past not why they become a firefighter us\nWhen you get in there that's a hard job\nReal stuff\nNow you've got pensions and things that are played out the window in Haiti parity this Nicholas cage\nThere's a lot and he just brought up a great point what about experience compare to those who've been doing it for Thirty years or five years or\nBecause we've only been doing a job or company or you don't deserve the same way as a guy who's been doing it for twenty five right now\nMost of the Pentagon skill level\nAnother words as a whole lot of time as well as you're listening to
