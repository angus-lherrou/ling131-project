to join us we're\nTalking about the Trump rally last night we're about to get in the air is county voting on a on the first day of early voting here in the mid term elections or Harris County residents ship set a brand new record\nIn turnout reveal record set back in twenty ten by thirty five thousand votes [noise] sixty three thousand one hundred and eighty eight people showed up to vote yesterday [noise]\nThat's pretty good considering it was on the exact same day that both of the major party candidates for us\nBut considering it was on the exact same day that both of the major party candidates for the U.S Senate Governor Greg Abbott president Donald Trump\nOf course Ted Cruz where campaigning downtown Houston\n... are two one five five eight ... did you watch the rally last night\nDid you go to the rally we had a call from ... who was inside the rallies edited filled up except for one little upper corner and then that filled up very quickly after that was before well before the president spoke\nSo but it's filled up pretty ... pretty well in the outside filled up very well also I'm Still I don't know if we'll ever have an accurate number of how many people actually showed up a mirror the event outside and we had at least one dollar called and said he couldn't find any where to park so we left\nSo I Do believe there were a lot of people there or Google Facebook Twitter and their staffs are overwhelmingly donating to the Democrats are out of the midterms that shouldn't really shock anyone considering they claimed to be still objective yeah just to anything but\nUm we also now learning that there may be a second migrant caravan heading for the U.S I'm a thousand or more Hondurans have crossed into their minds are following the first group of seven thousand people in Mexico\nSo how\nHow greed is your country when you have massive caravans of people just act spending cuts mass exodus and they all come here to America and they talked about how racism horrible we are but they don't want to come live here me thinks something is amiss\nWe've also learned from the Washington Post the first migrant a caravan\nNow includes illegal immigrants who've already been deported but they're just going to jump back and come on back in ... the media and the Democrats don't want you to talk about that you you don't want to know in a way come honestly I'm going to get into the Harris County residents setting record on first day of early voting but when it comes to illegal immigration I mean\nHonestly I I often follow ... well he's one of the why there's mines and and he talked to anyone will laugh they'll tell you use the greatest president of all the time we should listen to watch Morocco bomber had to say about illegal immigration\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected for undocumented what shocked what circumventing the line for waiting patiently generally unlawfully\nOr become immersed in this country so that's why we need to start by giving agencies charge for security technology you know facilities and more people to stop process and for illegal immigrants\nThat way to show that was brought her mama back in two thousand five before he ran for president while my how the worm has turned isn't it interesting the way they go in and things change\nYou know what for once I find myself in complete agreement with Morocco Obama\nIt's one of the few times you're going to find me there are so Harris County his mashed his previous record for early voting on the first day in a midterm election sixty three thousand one hundred and eighty eight went to the polls to cast ballots smashed the previous marks and back in twenty ten thirty five thousand votes\nMash them was more than thirty five thousand came on the same day that both a course Greg Abbott and President Trump or campaigning down in in Houston and additional fifty two thousand four hundred and Thirteen voters have returned to mail in ballots\nBrings the total figure to date one hundred and fifty thousand six hundred in one votes\nOn the first day of early voting in Harris County I Wonder what it is up to that because the polls are open for about another three minutes\nHarris County tally eclipse the first day toll in two thousand eight and the two thousand twelve presidential elections even though the midterms typically draw far fewer voters for men to Montgomery County experience similar surges\nUm Harris County clerk standards standards said there are just incredible numbers of turnout today lines are moving are getting out to vote and they're on their way there are people that actually camped out the vote just like people are camped out to go see a cruise and Trump\nThe crowds at the polls signal voters on through the athletic said University of Houston political science professor Brandon rotting house [noise] but which political party benefits remains to be pain he said we've seen a heavy increase in turnout and usually boost Democrats\nBut the early voting surge could simply show that more voters are choosing to avoid hassles of election day\nHistorically turn out on the first day tends to be exaggerated or it's impossible to know which party faithful are voting or if it's a surge in people who traditionally do not across the urban counties in Texas residents pushed a\nCame out to Bush and vote early as well Dallas County report in forty two thousand ballads by the afternoon Travis County tallied more than twenty four thousand by four pm and ... nearly Fifteen thousand\nBallots cast by one PM\nI'm Stan sanity knowledge in Harris County that long lines for many many of the forty six early voting stations but said his prepared for higher than average turn out by deploying additional voting machines\nYou said despite the volume lines were moving quickly\nI Know some people went out and voted today really didn't have much of a line at all so that's a good sign the day began in the pre dawn twilight at the metropolitan multi service center on west great where more than two thousand voters waited at the polls to open at eight am\nNow of course that was where ... showed up made a campaign stop many of them were cheering course that area doesn't surprise me\nBut he spoke to the crowd or as borders during after a bullhorn as they were waiting in Pasadena around eleven fifty and I am a Victorian Montoya wait in line with a couple of dozen other voters she sat her she's Mexican American family has always supported Democrats and they deserve a new senator and overwork\nYou can't complain about something and not do anything about it so that's why I'm Out her voting\nLadies and gentlemen I Want you to hear that she's absolutely right you can't complain about something and not do anything about it that's why she's voting sweats important for you to vote because she's voting they're Democrats are fired up there absolutely going to vote\nBefore he ran for president so there's a reason why the economy sucks ... didn't know what he was doing because he really had no real world experience other than\nSmoking a lot of weed and college with his tomb gang and in high school and experimenting with drugs and all that stuff and he was very attracted to the marches professors in that sort of stuff so he was very logical problem is you've got the lame stream media and then now of course Google Facebook Twitter they're all left these\nSo they're all going to push the information in which they want you to receive\nThat's what they do they're not objective they're not going to be objective they've never been objective we just now know thanks to more avenues for us to find out\nIt's a good thing is we're learning now when it comes to the care of it I'm not sure who's financing them but I can guarantee you there's definitely some of these ... out by the way Alex Jones was in town yesterday\nNew I guess he was there screaming at somebody outside of the rally on a bullhorn so there was that kind of stuff going on but there there's definitely these people that have this agenda the open borders type people that kind of stuff\nThey want to get in and they're going to manipulate and they're going to pay look how much money was given\nTo a Mr O'Rourke\nThirty eight and a half million dollars in the last quarter alone\nThat money is coming from Hollywood you got Jimmy Kimmel going on last night urging people to vote for Beto O'Rourke he went on Kobe or he went on Ellen show it's a concerted effort and they're doing everything they can in reality is we're learning\nA lot of people don't know here in America ... remember the anti war protests during a George W Bush's regime remember that\nMany of them were sponsored by China\nAs Trump would say China\nOr sponsored by North Korea but anyway we'll haw yeah\nThey would pay people to go sponsors it they get a bunch of young dumb and dumber idiots desert in college or as as they call them useful idiots that would show up and you just pay them they'll do whatever and smashed or something you didn't have to pay their so ideological out of whack they'll do whatever they would organize runners in there because they know what they're doing\nThey're absolutely meddling in our and you're talking about the Russian meddling in the election meddling every election soon as the Chinese so do various other entities\nSo the reality is you've always got this this is why as an electorate we need to stay involved when you say if we can not be complacent you need to know who you're voting for\nA once again they always say it's good we can get young people out and vote they really need to vote no no they don't\nYoung people do not need to vote I said this for very long time I'm going to continue to say it until it becomes better my point is I hate it when you get out and votes because they don't own anything they have to see them again and they get no real world experience and they don't even know who they're voting for they vote for left these\nAnd they they're clowns they're kids\nThey're more interested in getting high or getting late on friday night or getting drunk but they are on who's going to be insured in foreign policy who's going to be doing domestic policy\nWho's going to be dealing with terrorists like the hundred ISIS terrorists got over in Guatemala over the weekend or within the last few weeks I guess\nYeah we're ... we don't know the kids don't know they don't care which is bronco bottom look really cool when he was wearing sunglasses some vote for him I hate it when they show up they don't own anything they don't pay any taxes mom and daddy pay for most everything and they really don't know what they're talking about [noise]\nDoesn't mean they're bad people I don't I don't follow them at all I was young once and I enjoyed being a young kid I was a whole lot more informed than the average millennial is today\nBut nonetheless that's when you're supposed to do when you're a kid you're not supposed to be all involved in politics and I don't want somebody who's never paid taxes going to tell me that my property taxes need to go up\nI don't want someone who's never pay taxes to tell me that I Need to pay more out of my paycheck and my federal income taxes because they don't get it they don't understand\nSo I Would prefer that they would go back to doing what they do best not paying attention I like it when we have an educated electorate are sorry for the rap let's go back to the phones to anyone find they can see me to a one size I've eight five seven three eight let's go to Cheryl patiently holding an angle to shell thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHere um I don't

[noise] but over the can of worms\nThere is you have certain limitations you can't get within so many feet of the polling place\nTo manipulate people or whatever but here's the thing as we saw what Yolanda Jones people Democrats don't care about laws and honestly a lot of people don't have the stomach to enforce them [noise]\nSo what happens is they often break these election laws federal campaign laws we saw a with a Beto O'Rourke they accepted illegal contributions from outside of the country over the maximum out very similar to what happened do you guys remember how many millions of dollars Morocco bomber was supposed to return\nBecause of illegal campaign contributions the Democrats are always say they're really big about you know we need to cut down on these donations\nAnd we we didn't campaign finance reform and then they give you every penny they can get from anyone and everything and try to use it to manipulate the system is legal or illegal you know it's funny all those media people love Beto ABC CBS MSNBC CNN\nHaven't seen the story about the illegal campaign contributions once on their networks I had to go dig it out of the the deep caverns of the ...\nJohn hang on we'll get to the next on the other side is very short break and you're listening to Chris ex radio to a one ... one ... five eight five seven ... don't go away a whole lot more ... radio coming right on your [noise]\nHottest conservative podcast hosted America venture Barrow we nights at seven on can see the little voice\nOh should America venture bureau week nights at seven on can see the little boy you're trying\nTo sell your home when you're looking for the best look no further than Ronnie and Kathy Matthews at re max legends there Dr expertise and commitment to their clients is number one\nAnd that is what sets them apart for the rest of by the way why I lifted my home with them you know if you're relocating looking for a luxury home downsides of your first time buyers running and Kathy ... is our number one\nThe number one re max team in Texas and they hadn't been for almost two decades call running Kathy Matthews on ... to eight one four four oh Seventy nine hundred\nAnd see for yourself or go on line to Ronnie and Kathy dot com that's Cathy we'll see\nThey sell over nine hundred homes a year and they know every inch of the buying and selling marketing Houston and our expert servicing buyers and sellers coal Ronnie and Kathy Matthews that rematch legends your realtor for white their mind to eight one four four oh Seventy nine hundred that's doing one for for oh suddenly nine hundred\nFor it to the number one ... online Ronnie and Kathy dot com\nOh how do you get ready to go out a shower and you might hear the R U even a human\nBeing on the matter what you do dollar shame has everything you need to look heal and now you're hoping at lunch and not something you want to be doing at night and ... which is why you want in an apartment waiver yet you see that they leave her mouth\nAnd laughing surprisingly long time but the high rating by hunter helps washing away the working awesome you can feel soft and who is like a ...\nI Hope showering in front of your heart how you get ready to go out by the matter what you do yeah he had everything in a in right now and get a dollar shave club stars that his five bucks each and that is our that he brushed that are there any shame butter and rain or any one of the five dollar of the plane and try out they're amazing parts I part of their ... and her body quieter and it's just amazing\nAnd calling and I didn't hear the news a little bit of Hong ... products that regular price ignoring today a dollar shame ... dot com it's less than a dollar fan club that black ... on your local pharmacy and rode around in store for them and it's up to get into ... dot com laugh and check it out right now [noise]\nJosh crucifix reveal days before right here on a seven hundred can see the Senator Ted Cruz welcome to protect radio thanks for being here ... you can wrap my first question for users are your arms a little sore from mopping the floor with mental ...\nYesterday [laughter] well you know we had on and I do think that that was a clear and real contrast\nFacts radio we'd be for those six great here on them boys from Texas [noise]\n\n\nGibbs [noise]\nI guess I'm not to override\n[noise] see I've got it from\nA forty right there ... jak are used to rock and my ... my ... wreck hair he did come [laughter] ...\nRadio uh here on the voice of the actors am seven hundred K.

I I I think you're you're right they always put the women and children up fraud it's similar to terrorists when they were doing that I just remember when they would use the women and children as human shields it's very similar now I Know there are women and children tried to escape those areas but there's a whole lot of able bodied young men\nThat are in there and I looked at some of those pictures of those crowds those it's listen when you're escaping oppression you do not come waving the flag of the country and what you're a scathing oppression from\nThese people are waving these the ... the flag of Honduras yet they're scared to go back to their country why are you even slack in other words it was not the teams they're liars like many of them\nHave come before and we don't know who they are it's seven thousand blood people I can guarantee you there was some of those well it must Thirteen gang members and there there's criminals we know now there are precisely the border the illegal aliens in their\nRoom certainly right rich we need to stop them whether it's tear gas whatever it is sorry you're going to be stalled in Mexico and is Trump would say next ... going to pay for it\nThey should pay for it for allowing this to happen they allowed to do their southern border and they have no problem letting them and for us away right up to our border to come right across\nBecause you know why there's going to be a lot of Mexicans in there as well in Mexico makes a lot of money off illegal migration into our country let's go to ... thing and Katie thinks we're holding on to rebuild welcome to the voice of Texas\nHere to talk with you I let them stay on the radio and um I I Know I'm so thankful that get the opportunity in fall and I'm like why can't they add and one of the videos show if somebody was handing them trash you think they can be done drug cartel did\nWell no I don't think it's the drug cartels they are doing that because they have to pay the drug cartels across the border that's the way that works\nThere are activists and other people that are more than happy to hand them a little cash give them a little seed money to give them up to the border trying to make the way across so it's I'm pretty sure there's some sort of activists helping them out with food clothing water money whatever it is\nIt's definitely not the drug cartels the cartels ... those people will pay anywhere from thirty five hundred to five thousand or more just across that border nobody cross that border from the U.S in Mexico without going through the cartels first\nWow interesting like I you know ... hours painting the um the majority of them ended up here and I mean like\nYou know how many the women or children in their you know and then I'm also I'm like you said they're waving their flag it can wait another flag that they can make more sense but\nThe president seems to be really serious about this he's mentioned already the the billions of dollars they're getting for for a wall to build a wall I'm real border security and he seems to be serious about it also a mention he'll send the military down they'll send the national guard wouldn't be the first time\nThat was the reservists are or somebody like that are down on the border in this country care of and continues to go the direction it's going and nothing happened to Mexico doesn't do anything\nWe may see an overwhelming show of force at the border and it wouldn't surprise me one bit and you're right if the federal government won't do their job well then the state of Texas will do their job I have a governor Abbott doesn't do it then clearly the citizens of this state taxes just a little different than the rest of the country\nAnd we all know that we're pretty proud of our state and well like I said let's just hope the federal government gets their job and you know what who says we can't help the federal government with that process and we we do that my voting for one and two is assisting them with whatever help\nThey might need to eighty one side they came to me let's go to Jesse listening in southwest used to rain on Jesse welcome to the voice of Texas\nA thank you for coming into\nA wall of the work that needs to reveal yes\nYou're right it is a a a and a\nMan in the\nComing across the board in Jerusalem you know I mean they it same thing now from right to vote on them I mean I think so\nI think it really ... for them to your\n... your for the more now the other thing that is very important thing here is that we need to remember the they were here\nYou are not have any right now they have their country and then you know and many people are not any right so why should we deal with them right [noise]\nWell just ... I think you really call it's interesting points and these people you know have basic human rights would that being said\nDo they have a right to come into our country illegally and that they do not nobody has the right to come into this country legally we know thousands and thousands and thousands of people do it every year do they deserve to die for it I don't think so and I I don't want us to go down on the border and start shooting these people but when we find stories like what's coming out of the\nUh what was it ... it over a hundred ISIS terrorists have been taken out of 'em want the mama okay that is a threat\nThat is a ... that's a very dangerous threat to our we know there were thousands and thousands of people coming across the border they're raping women they're committing burglary drunk driving homicides you name it go look at the statistics roughly one third of our prison population\nOr people that are in this country illegally and they're not in jail for being here illegally they're in jail because they'd gone on to commit other crimes so\nWhen you talk about a major threat\nYeah you talked to some of these families who had loved ones murder or killed by legal immigrants I'm pretty sure there probably be willing to shoot to try to stop these people from coming across the border\nI'm not necessarily that point I think there are better ways to do it and I think one is by having a a real border\nComprehensive border patrol have all of a state of the art technology there's no reason why we can't get this done when we're spending billions and billions and billions of dollars to countries that hate us the least we can do and shore up our own borders\nMakes sense to me uh two one five eight case even if you want to join us let's go to willy listening in New guinea have Willie thinks we're hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nI don't miss it according to what you're for it I might have been on this if you are blind ... make go or going on with China or\nI'm willing to Mexico for allowing this caravan to come through its southern border and go freely all the way to the the northern border of Mexico to come into the U.S absolutely\nBut you do know they're not married for ethical responsibility to protect our own correct\nAbsolutely you're correct that is not their responsibility is absolutely one hundred percent our responsibility\nOr I might have Illinois outlet J what the problem they're probably you\nKnow I get to Donald Donald Trump credit if you do what do you think if Congress response look like a free for all for calling them man I just do something or other what Dick the four corners of the three\nYeah our government is not the only one that\nYeah you're not only are you right on your absolute and that's something I've been saying for years\nIt is not Mexico now don't get me wrong Mexico clearly has some culpability by allowing these people just on a pipeline to come straight to our country but it is what a hundred percent our responsibility to protect our borders in our country and it doesn't fall on anyone else\nSo when you say that you're dead on his Congress's irresponsibility I'm not doing their job and he goes on both sides of the eye when you're dead on\nAnd my and my problem you I was told I Believe it's the most powerful country in God and three and we can't protect our Robert decree it\nWe really put that in our government but I don't blame Mexico I don't blame you know we won't have to go on the smartest people we both would take our own sovereign Solomon in there and I appreciate the time\nThank you so much really willy willy you made some really good point the only thing I'll add to what you say is you're right\nWe are a government of the people by the people for the people so technically our government is us we don't have the stomach and we literally have not had the stomach to do whatever it takes to protect our borders we haven't we're getting close your mind today born out there you're right on\nAnd the government not doing it we are the most powerful greatest country\nThat has ever existed and to think that we can't protect our own borders [noise]\nHe's simply because they haven't wanted to Donald Trump made it very clear and that was part of a deal he's trying to get it done and he's been fighting both sides of the Iowa that's\nYour right hand I'll give them a lot of credit to I I think he's going to do everything you can build that wall\nAnd I think he's going to do everything he can to try to stop this ... coming in it'll be really interesting to
