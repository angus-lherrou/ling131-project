side of the break we're going to pick up with a Dan Simons want to make sure I get your calls we're going to talk about the birthright citizenship\nTrump said executive action Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation and that's\nWhen he got a whole lot to cover on today's program and then after we we talk with Dan Simons we're going to be taken a whole lot of phone calls regarding his first and foremost let's go to willy who's been patiently holding up through the right willy thank you so much for hanging on welcome to the voice from Texas\nSo hey how're you doing\nThis you know than it was we looked down if they are okay but I Do too\nAnd I don't care for a while and went on that ship right if he wants to live that way if\nYou\nAre listening to them maybe\nYou know first of all you're referring to the fourteenth amendment and birth rate Christian ship has absolutely nothing to do with the fourteenth amendment\nWas David\n[noise] that's what I Know what was the late ... early or late sixties when they went through and they were using that as their ah their guys to go with the birthright censorship regarding illegal immigrants another people coming over here\nThe fourteenth amendment deals you talked about earlier Willie when you said was regarding slaves and their children are absolutely right I don't think what he meant when he was answering the question he talked about birthright citizenship that is not stated in the fourteenth amendment mc ... unless I Want to go back to your premise cause your premise is a good one here saying can you go back a my assumption is one is\nThe president can do an executive order and just about anything we saw Morocco momma did it and granted a legal status for all the the dreamers if you will or so we we got that issue but once again that went to the Supreme Court as you pointed out and was overturned so\nIt looks like if he took executive action he would probably get overturned or at least not just like his you know his man on people coming from the terrorist areas so I think you made me write if he tried to go executive action I think if they do this they would have to go the route of what Lindsey Graham is saying introduced legislation to do it\nAnd he does nothing you want to make a point is I from what I take from this he would not be who's currently here it would be from this point forward you can't go back and take citizenship away from people that are already citizens so I think it would apply from this point forward if in fact somehow somehow it went through\nThe Fort Worth a bit unfair for even if you want in this country you\nKnow it does not OK when everybody had going for a measure of your ...\n... what it was referring to the fourteenth amendment makes me think for the call we'll recall what you're referring to is just the fourteenth amendment we know there were people that did not want slaves giving birth to children in there and that's how they were trying to stop them\nFrom getting citizenship and it was clearly he was a travesty and that can be the case the fourteenth amendment was added after the civil war order to de legitimize what ... what was the Dred Scott decision which held in black slaves weren't citizens of the United states\nWas in the southern states from denying citizenship to write to newly freed slaves the amendment guaranteed that the slaves would have privileges of citizenship by providing all persons born or naturalized in the U.S\nAnd subject to the jurors their niche and they're of our citizens of the U.S and the states were were within they reside\nBasically what it was ... and ... there's a whole lot more to this but what it was going to was the slaves they'd been freed and they weren't considered citizens well now they were allowed to have children they are citizens and this was once again\nThe Democrats in the south trying to hang on and keep a African Americans as slaves and not give them citizenship and had nothing to do with what happened it wasn't until the sixties when are these the the illegal situation came and they wanted to\nTo try to give them and of course they were they went with fourteenth amendment to trying to do this but even back then there is a case from Eighteen eighty four called el ... versus Wilkins will get into that a little bit more later I Want to jump to marry and then get the bench groups that Mary thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThank you uh well I think the United states needs to remove all and thin it\nTo people around the world from coming into our country illegally so obviously are not getting people's children citizenship\nOr a free education or medical care or just all incentive for coming into this country illegally need to be removed and if we\nIf we don't remove them and we have only ourselves to blame I I really don't blame the Fox for coming into the in house\nIf you leave the door wide open the Fox will come I blame our government for this husky Lucy goosey don't enforce our laws immigration policy\nI blame the are the American government for this problem I Do not blame the people fleeing their bad situations trying to\nGet a better life here we're leaving the door wide open we're putting incentives out there for the Fox to come in you know it's our fault it's the government's fault and I was in and against the people who cross it legally\nMarry you sound like exactly what I've been saying and I said that for years and years and years\nWe I Do not blame people for wanting to come to America this is the greatest country that ever existed despite the insanity on the left is not their fault it is or is it is absolutely our responsibility\nTo patrol our borders to you know to actually enforce them and to make sure that we do this right so but I agree with you almost one hundred percent getting rid of the incentives and then a lot of those problems will go and still are our job but nonetheless are they really goes we're gonna we're gonna pick up with political contributor\nOf course one of the egos you're on Fridays from four to six men streets and joins us now live\nHey Ben thanks for hanging on welcome back to the voice in Texas\nTrick or treat [laughter] I don't have any candy and you'd have to come back tomorrow hey Hey Chris okay you know I\nDecided to vote today so like any other voter I Walk out to the polling location Harris County I look at all the signs out there and I say at least a half a desert if not more signs for people running for crying I asked the school board\nAnd I go wait a minute I incline I stay the same people that decided to hold a tax ratification election a tax increase election on August fifteenth in the middle of summer time when nobody was around in the Republican convention and it was it in a different city\nAnd I said wait a minute I got to find out he was running and here the income which are 'cause I don't want to vote for them so I go back to my car and I started Googling on my iPhone and turns out there's only one incumbent running for reelection his name is Steve fins act\nAnd you get fired for threatening a female coworkers and cheating the counting on your time sheets by the way you're finding affidavits swearing to that's your time that's felony\nSo he gets fired for those two things you should be disqualified it yeah and that's what I presented to them on my opponent Democrat socialist opponent what do they do\nThey not only go and say Mr vinyl indoors was a left under questionable circumstances which there was no question\nThey took it a step further and lie to flat out blatantly lied and said I was reprimanded from the da's office which blows my mind I'm thinking\nYou guys you guys can't even just be a reasonable and ... just looked at that but what I'm up against it not just him if the socialist out the chronicle those oil\nWill in the the information you brought up you talked about getting fired and and you're lying on the time she's like I said this is what your your opponent did and this is my phone and it yeah and then you you go back in the ... the chronicle did they endorse your opponent\nThey endorse them and basically tried to make him out to be a darling and and they they had the firing letter because I gave it to him I had to go through can pack sends out that the public record request that the ... office and I showed it to them and I'm David Makovsky and\nThey didn't say anything about it and it said he left under questionable circumstances there was no question about\nLadies and gentlemen this is the reason why when you don't show up to vote to these kinds of people end up getting elected we're talking about the opponent the guy running against Dan Simons don't you remember Dan's name\nHe's running for Harris County criminal court of law number eight Simon's for judge dot com is the website if you think oh well we just got in the bag and this is why conservatives have to vote this guy should not be allowed to run anywhere near anything remotely resembling a judge\nAfter the things that he's done an end to be in in all fairness Dan the fact that the chronicle endorsed her opponent should be a badge of honor because they left the organization and that's all they do they'll throw in a token Republican every now and then but that's all they do their activist and they are not media\nWhich is the longest ... a lot of people don't understand that so\nI got a I've got a one and a half so I'm I'm and some of the people you have four and five started I'm thinking man I really hate me down there I'm\nI stand for everything that they have that I'm\nReal I'm a threat to\nYou know the Democrat socialist and Democrat Party and I'm going to follow the law and I'm a conservative they just cannot stand that down there and you know what I'm I'm fine with that it just it just blew my mind that they would not only tried to cover it from my own it but they also rely on me just flat out lately to lie\nAfter saying they've done their research I was never reprimanded from the ...\nIn fact my crew the da's office a lot of people uh couldn't match up to it\nSo well in the reality is unfortunately you're not the first person to chronicle was married and you probably won't be the last ... what you said the fact that you have integrity and you're a conservative that's\nThat's all you need to be said you're ... you're like you get a star and a half from the [laughter] the way they are right and we're talking with Dan Simons once again Simon's for judge dot com you want more information he's a conservative running against the socialist you mentioned your opponent is ... well they called them as a democratic socialist fact\nBy the Democratic socialist of America grew you the only one of the state of Texas back by the national group he is running under democratic socialist of America ban or the or the ... and he just flat out held back on his Web page that\nEven get the New York times I mean there's a lot of they're they're really all about this socialism and going back to my background\nIn a socialistic society someone like me to not come up from practically nothing getting here this is about capitalism\nAnd you know what I'm for everybody I tell her about it in my story not for sympathy but for inspiration you get to decide what your fate is you work hard enough you can get here and they stand absolutely against that\nYou know so absolutely that's socialist are and of course the chronicle which is filled with a bunch of little quote Democrat socialist because well\nThat's a great thing about America you can be as ignorant as you want and fortunately some unfortunately some of them right for certain rags it's funny listening crystal said on the morning hold them to comical and a lot of people have nicknames for them they're they're no longer really about journalism and it doesn't matter they've gotten rid of all Hanukkah bands\nUp a lot better you know taking it off for a a name like your corporate chronicle I think that's a lot better\n[laughter] needed to create the chronicle believe me out and we're talking with Dan Simons Harris County criminal court of law number eight candidates he's running for judge Simon's for judge dot com you just heard about his opponent was in the first one he told me I found out about this through somebody else I don't even remember who it was but I saw in the documentary is talking about\nThe the guy who's running against Dan Simons cheated on his time she got fired from the job breaking the law as you mentioned in it would be a felony correct if the charges were pressed\nThat's correct I Would have been a felony 'cause he basically filed a swearing that these are my time but he didn't even more importantly than that when you get fired for threatening and harassing a female co worker from a position where he represent people for free\nAre you kidding me I mean that women should\nTake note of that too because the court house a lot of women are working those courthouses and this is the kind of respect this guy has to women\nAnd when there's a line deeper than that there's a lot of flaws with the individual\nYou want to know why I call the chronicle garbage they endorse that cloud that guy's a cloud there isn't that guy is no business running but even when people don't know that's why Dan Simons came on the program today to talk about that when you go to vote understand you have a choice\nAnd I know you guys a lot of you've already voted those of you who have not you still got early voting through friday and the next Tuesday one week from today to vote when you get out and you want a conservative choice for criminal court of law

F. C. V. if you want to join us to any one five five eight five seven three eight let's begin with Jay already been holding in Jersey village thanks for hanging on JR welcome to the voice of Texas\nA M Trump is a byproduct of chain migration right ... ... what\nTrump is from ... migration right his mother tank America because her two sisters who are already here therefore cheesecake migration that's the reason why she's here the only reason why I'm here in America today and when it comes to her being a naturalized citizen\nQuestion as to whether or not she was actually a naturalized when she claimed that she was\nSo you know Trump tonight on\nAll the information to make sure that she actually went through a proper channels and didn't lie and say she was a here naturalized when she was a Donald could come up with that that would be nice to see and therefore that would make him not of a system by birth of the country ... mother\nNow the DACA deal I don't think that was voted on I think you're right I I look at it when I get back to my computer but I think that was a wish made in heaven by the demon rats and and he signed off on it\nAnd I you know it is just it it it becomes the wet it becomes the wedge like enforcing the law with taking kids away from the parents that are going to jail which is common sense to me\nWhen they're in eight eight cages they wanted to call it or contained environment at least it will breed wasn't a hot room you know there's there's things that we incorporate as we see this insurgents coming to the border and if there's a conflict at the border with the troops\nYou can imagine how that's going to interrupt into all kinds of fodder for the living room rationing communist press\nSo who's your right I I I Want to go and\nSee people honest in their citizenship I think out of ... you know I was telling somebody day why does it take three years in three guys are getting jobs now become a citizen this country doesn't mean we don't want a man why can't we learn American history in a week\nAnd then get her own meals or at least in Texas history for we can agree to be a citizen and here's your taxpayer id\nYou know they really call them or at least it's interesting Dr then he went to the Supreme Court and I think it was up against it so once again they may be right I don't know when it comes to\nAny birthright citizenship seems like ... passing it through the house would be the better option and going that route but the president obviously ... can you know consulting with attorneys and more you know you talk to different attorneys you can get all kinds of answers just asked Michael ... let's go to for instance you know who's holding in Katie thinks we're hanging on Francisco welcome to the voice from Texas\nChris how're you doing I'm good how are you rent Cisco\nAlready or first yeah I guess I get a thing you know why the parents are are Americans and then their child is born here\nThen that's fine but according to write the lady of event can go there a limit of the ticket better the little ego maybe go through the process of becoming an American assimilate and whatnot\nYou know don't don't integrate in the system and whatnot hey I can accept that\nBut I have here that they wanted to continue on this or if not only the power money or control that the Democrats are afraid to lose\nTwo rules but I think it's also very barrel life to put a player he's the one drop in my opinion when Trump became president all deals that were made by Democrats or Republicans are here and void\nNow do you remember any of the godfather movies yeah a little bit\nOkay well what the godfather gives you something let's say like cash or watch rain what ever owned the godfather calls\nOn for a favor and you know you might as well start in your own hold your head\nYeah it is and instead of four separate from the godfather and then say well okay now what I get into it as well from lab reflecting within myself I came to an understanding that\nSince President Trump became president and all the other ear and boy by Democrats and Republicans and made these deals that you get with with anyone who had big what people with deep pockets they want their money back and they want more because of their investments with any one of these parties but I'm afraid to say that money is wrong\nAnd they are real says that's not too I think you make you make really good point because you're right he was neither of their horse he was not there who were they had different horses in the race and somehow he got it so now clearly the the deals they give us a call for instance go I was going to hear from you\nClearly the deal with the American people's a little different but we found that politicians on both sides of the hour we'll they tend to try and play by their own rules and Trump was not their guy he was not beholden to either of them so he's doing when he campaigned on doing\nAnd man there's it's he's talking about just\nBlowing them up on on a daily basis a good call let's go to auto in Katie a auto thank you for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texans\nHow're you doing good how are you on them\nI didn't know these just fine thank you um I Hope you are the well I'm\nI just wanted to mention these Exxon pool you know if somebody marries a ... a a Cuban\nWorking turn around and see the written down the street is that she can because of the time and whatever you have to work through the sheep\nThey and they say okay the the the type of girls they do they have their crews are over there now we know what you were in front of her\nHonor can lead to more no they're not ready to use an American you hold on auto auto she's an American ... with us from\nLa auto don't tell me to hold on you said something incorrect on correcting you hit you as Ted Cruz's mother is an American citizen she's never been a Canadian citizen\n\nSo far what would last year um you know what time auto he told me a little bit we get senator 'cause we have time to get to a small bit in court on one jak let's do against Senator Paul Bettencourt on St Paul ah welcome to the subject to have you back on the show\nIt's great to be on and they can get some breaking news for you guys um the um the bottom line is that there's been a serious problem with the voter roll in Harris County is finally coming to the surface that Kurt voter registrar is allowing thousands of people to register and commercial addresses\nSo we just at a press conference between myself a stance than or the county clerk Criss Angel that district clerk and the treasurer layman Sanchez because we went to UPS Store that had eighty four people registered at it and you'll be happy to know the twenty two already voted\nWhile they had there was a hundred sites like this around the county\nI you know what I Hope some of the local television networks are paying attention or listening right now many ought to reach out and talk was injured Betancourt this sounds like a huge problem to me senator backward\nWell we did and we had some we had some pretty good TV coverage today and I'm expecting that will be on you know multiple channels now that and of course you know there is there been people fighting this story um you know go below the progressive left at you know allies but we\nWe went out and basically what happened was a chronicle editorialists challenged a Santa and I ... that we didn't have any evidence so we literally took everybody and show them the store and what's really interesting is that a lot of these people um you know one person was called to\nJury duty now if if they get on a jury and they and they found out that they don't live in Harris County it throws out the entire voting um and that's what happened in the er\nThe cheerleader you know a a ... you know mom that uh got off for murder fan\nIt's it's so but what's amazing about this criticism that you can see everything play out on Paul Bettencourt dot com or or a vote Betancourt\nBut uh the good news is is that we're show putting a light on it because here's why it's important there's been one of one Republican race was decided by twenty two votes in March\nWe had a state rep race decided by seven of this one store had voted twenty two people I mean literally it's a UPS Store\nAnd use it how many of these people that do you know of the word used business addresses for their voter registration\nAnd he said how many of these people that you know of a red used business addresses for their voter registration there there\nWas one hotter places that have more than ten ten voters in it now\nAround county know acidic or will these votes if they go through all these votes mean Nolan void because right\nNow the voter registrars letting them on the role said this is this is the elections have consequences when Mike Sullivan lost the race\nUm he basically a was you know what was not signing people up to a commercial um businesses and and but however and with the help of the county attorney\nIs doing it and not only doing this there in federal court fighting releasing the names I'm known non citizens because the jury will kiss that those things to the tax office to take off the boat\nAnd and she won't confound that she's taking no non citizens off the boat or oh\nWow okay now we are a lot more coming on this but but you know but the bottom\nLine is that we had to literally for\nStalwart Republicans standing up and saying we don't want people registering it commercial addresses we want to know that people that self identify as non citizens are taken off the voter roll and wouldn't to basically demanding and that it just to speak because she won't give an answer on this\nMan well first of all I Know we're about to break I Want to thank you for calling bargain this news I may have you come back tomorrow if you have time to talk about this more say well do you send update OK okay and then\nCheck it out at that moment and Gore dot com or vote Betancourt on Facebook\nThere you go home and ... on Facebook\nA that's a problem that's a big problem I'm really glad senator fall they were called in\nI don't think we talk about this clearly on friday I if he's got time I'll get them back on tomorrow's show\nWe'll talk a lot more about this hour each time it looks like we've got automatic auto hang
