admit that it's his fault Jeff Zucker says the same thing the Democrats and the media all blaming it all on Trump and he responded by saying\nA very big part of the anger we see in our society today is caused by the purpose fully fall an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media\nThe false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that he refers to fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful did his beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast do you agree with the president's statement\nTo aid won five five eight ... to lead one five five eight five seven reader is anyone shocked that the Democrats are blaming Donald Trump and anyone who supports them for this kind of action\nI mean clearly they blamed Bernie Sanders when the crazy Bernie Sanders supporters well the one guy shots these delays wanted for others before he was killed by security or another when stabbed or was it killed two people in stabbed another before they clearly blamed Bernie ... oh no they didn't\nOh you mean they had the exact opposite opinion oh you mean they're duplicitous in their rhetoric and their nature\nComing from CNN president Jeffrey Zucker the guy who hires\n[noise] reporters certain guys by the name of Jim Acosta\nWho said when using national if you mean white nationalist a guy who's tried to pay the president in every way but\nFake news believe me you guys fake news completely\nCNN is garbage now you know what garbage look who's running it\nDoing one five I vacated maybe if you want to join us to read one five five eight five seven three eight and then you've got there's on MSNBC and ... we've talked about this at a gym and the entire left wing\nOf the Democratic party well it's the media there the propaganda arm for the Democrat Party they're all Democrats they donate Ninety plus percent of the Democratic party and they made it very clear that Trump is not their president well they'll cover him and try to destroy him at every opportunity\nIt is amazing that they never talked about how Hillary Clinton said well you know we can't be civil until we get power back or they don't go off on Maxine Waters their words do matter right Eric Holder\nThey can say whatever they want a President Obama they bring a knife would bring a gun you know by the way very quickly did you see that a Chuck Grassley call for an investigation into 'em well Mr ... and the third accuser of Mr cab another one that said he was ... spending and gang rapes\nBecause clearly it was a ...\nOne hundred percent manufactured story was manufactured lies\nYeah anyway I just wanted to mention that so that earlier uh once again if you want to join us we're talking about what's going on with the with such this rhetoric harsh rhetoric\nIs this the president's fault was it Bernie Sanders fault that crazy guy went and shot Steve deletion for others and tried to kill them just Republicans practicing but I don't think they have the same thing to say back then to add one five five eight case to be looked at an auto who's been patiently holding auto thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey guys you know you're saying that anybody that does include there is a group and I do agree with you on both sides\nUh if you do not on the Bible is your big agree with you know don't don't drawn out affair and it's like\nOh crap out of you who you are wrong with you a fee I beat the crap out of you if you are you in court don't worry about it I like the Orange County in the face I mean I can go on and on and on and all\nYeah I mean you know we you know he went back hold on on um hold on glass auto auto hold on a flight auto hold on you do know he came back and he said absolutely apologize little statement she said it wasn't right and he doesn't condemn violence on anyone you do know he said that right\nYes and I I I was so surprised and I raised that I really want to McCain uh the only need that many times when you have them we will that\nUnderstand you know that we can agree to disagree I mean I don't like drunk like John I'm going to follow you on you you\nKnow I mean I'm with you we we we are we're we're all ... vote on on our choice is to go vote well then all those\nAll first of all ... grams or we thought it was first of all you're absolutely right I agree with you were supposed to respect and whether you and I agree on something when we're done I Want to shake hands and many friends in because this is America this ... this is we're supposed to be a better place\nBut the laws that were going back to that ... ... your perspective is important and we were talking about Donald Trump said\nHe said when that when that was happening there was a paid agitator at one of his rallies like punched that guy in the mouth he absolutely said he has to pay their bills and in somebody did he immediately did at one eighty with no no no I didn't really mean that don't punch anyone don't attack anyone don't do this I condemn violence\nHe absolutely did that the point I'm making is let's go back to Hillary Clinton she said we can't have civility until they're back in ...\nThe point I'm making is let's go back to Hillary Clinton she said we can't have civility until they're back in charge has Maxine Waters backed off and never statements encouraging mobs of people to go around people and tell them they're not welcome in this country anytime anywhere has Eric Holder condemned his statements\nWe're not seeing any condemnation from one particular side which leads to the problem with what you've just said they're going to be very difficult to go and get along with somebody who believes that well it's okay to get groups of people to follow you home and shouted you in a in a mob that's dangerous I Do you agree\nUh I agree with you partially true you know the damage used on on easy it's not true you can go and watch you you'll Google in a think Trump inciting violence for these over and over and over and even some of them won't you know it\nDidn't matter what you're saying it will have clearly it's mind Sanders ... what you're saying is clearly was Bernie Sanders faulted that guy tried to murder those Republicans and Dan they're killed these ... it's his fault\nNo no because he never said I Know the crap out of the game I like the ... in the face a you know forget about grabbing women by that but I Know you're just like like no drop out of the ... with you I promise you on\nAuto I've just told you he already he went back and\nI told you he went back and condemned those statements is that not count do you not believe in apologies in other words nothing he you want to know why people can't get along I don't know you just proved it\nThank you for the call you just proved that no matter what Donald Trump says or does he made a mistake it doesn't matter he's evil he's wrong and there's nothing fixing it you didn't say one word about Hillary Clinton you didn't want to learn about Maxine Waters you didn't want to learn about any of these other people you want to know why people get get along I don't know that is the reason why\nYou can't totally in my program expecting me to bend over and just let you say what you want factual or not I have already gone over on this program absolutely Donald Trump said that immediately we spend that didn't that my God I'm Sorry I don't do that and he said every other rally afterwards\nIn fact we learned later that the Democratic party was paying those people to not only get taxed Trump supporters to commit violence at these rallies\nYou want to know because it had happened previously over and over and over again at his rallies\nSo he responded because he wasn't prepared wrong it was and he immediately admitted it Hillary Clinton has never admitted that it's wrong to say you can't be civil with someone so we're back in charge there totalitarian it is their political ideology\nThat is why we have the problem auto using like a really nice guy but clearly you are one sided you can't get along with Donald Trump I talked about the statement he made over twelve years ago grabbing women by the\nWhat was pulled on a hot and that he didn't know he was being recorded and he never said that he did it he said that if you're rich women will let you do anything context is important to grab you by to\nAbsolutely he said it you know what else he did when it came out he apologized said it was wrong it was locker room talk and he was doing goofy stuff than guys do he was in front of a crowd and he was performing\nBut it's okay to the others\nThat when they go do it well no they don't even have to say there's sorry insult Trump's fault this just a narrative the media wants you to believe auto that's why and I've done is more research clearly than you and let's go to Rob who's been hanging out a long time Rob banks were hanging out and walk into the voice in taxes\nWere\nCorrupt to rank a mix of ... and ... says\nThat they're seeking asylum applies to the first country to re enter so if they're from America to Mexico were there should be returned to Mexico because that's a country that has to do to prevent the asylum in my right\nUm yeah I think technically you're right but Rob unfortunately these people don't follow along otherwise they would go to the U.S embassy or they would go to the the border where you the the station at the border where you apply for asylum but don't they don't care if they're wanting to come directly and they don't care about laws laws don't matter you're absolutely right\nIt's a ... to ... people you\nKnow there is no law that requires him to bring people and that is falls from the news the fake news if you will\nTurn around and say ... border\nPatrol does it every single day in our country to the tune of thousands we can send the military to our border and we can say guess what you're trying to invade our country you are not welcome air you're not applying for asylum if you want to apply for asylum set right on over there is a station and they'll talk to you and you can go do that\nSo but what's happening is you got these lessons in the media by the way I Know it sound like an animated that was yelling at auto earlier I was an auto sounds like a really nice guy he's just blinded by the media\nHe's been brainwashed to believe everything they tell them to believe so I wasn't attacking him back to the point Rob yes he can send troops to the border of the national guard we can say you're not welcome no you can't come across\nAnd make them apply for asylum and if they granted asylum then they can come in they got to get that these people clearly there skating poverty not tyranny\nBig difference that does not qualify for asylum sing recalls you guys doing a great ... let's go take a break and we'll be back with more precise radio you want to jump college then join in on the conversation on five ha and see the way he won by five eight five seven three [noise]\nWho did that he actually cares about what are you doing and what he says and does what his electorate voted for him to do but you're right the media hates them the media is dominated by leftist and you're right there are people on the right they attacked Obama in a very similar fashion the media didn't but the people there were people in the right to did\nSome of it was worth it just like some of it's warranted on Trump\nBut the reality is when you write these people don't care about you many of them are leaders especially in the media the media are the worst elitist among them the television crowd oh you got to see the way the television crowd treats the radio people's hilarious\nNot all of them but many of them on the left they really do and it's unfortunately you can paint a lot of my political colors\nAnd it's it's sad but that's where we are and we see a twenty four hours a day seven days a week on to on twenty four hour news channels and on social media thank you for the call appreciate it let's go to Judy Judy thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThank you love your show of course I'm you know I guess to me it's so obvious when you look back at the election when Hillary Clinton lost she was thoroughly thoroughly\nUpset about it and I I noticed all of this name calling and you know other back and forth and\nThe ... Trump paid and and all of that really started I mean in my eye it looks like they're really that loser\nWill and Judy holes and let you finish but you're absolutely right the rhetoric went up about twelve nachos and when she lost [laughter] because it was it was supposed to be written in her favor and she lost she couldn't even speak to the people that showed up for her that night and then go back and then what happened\nShe became the leader of quote the resistance their term not hers she's gone in told President Trump or racist whatever instead of feeding\nA nice thing quite leaned going away like you're supposed to know that's not what she did she's the leader of the resistance and that rhetoric trickles down from the topic they say and so you're absolutely right it went up twelve nachos and it hasn't come down to its own that have gotten worse\nYou know another thing I wanted to point out in my opinion as well is that you know trying opening or what I Would call a real man when you make a mistake you let's say something or you you said it wrong you know if it if you have a um\nCharacter\nOr within yourself that you can say hey I made a mistake you know that speaks volumes to me it really that I Wish\nPeople would just okay it'll it as far as I'm concerned nobody you're listening to them\nI mean they look like they're twelve years old\nYou know ... and they're having a fit and the store can that model what lines and candy and that's\n... ... your Judy thank you really do you do you're absolutely right they're acting like pets you with children but the problem is there are people that tend to agree with him already absolutely go ride along with them because they feel just a slight did Hillary Clinton was supposed to be our president I played the audio thousand times and the reason I'm not going to play right now she's got a bunch\nOf calls when they get through but they they everyone in the media thought there's no way this guy's going to win and then he won and they can't handle it they can't accept it so they're trying to do everything they can to undermine him to cut his legs out from under him and then impeach him and they sent it they mean it let's go to Marie in Houston ... thanks for hanging on welcome to the motion Texas\nI got to say thank you because I found that you had on that we're talking about how the papal trade him and what it was part of our family and I thought about Paul Ryan and all the others and I just kept saying he's right right right so I don't know he was but he made my day\nI think it was was it will I think it was Willie they're called no I mean not ...
