SETV to age one five five eight case to be so Stormy Daniels has replied after Trump calls her horse face\nUm she went to Twitter as well and said ladies and gentlemen the present you your president in addition to his um shortcomings she says he's demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and the lack of self control on Twitter again\nAnd perhaps a penchant for beast reality game on tiny she says\nMenu again Michael ... doing the same thing waiting at the president's\nHe said you're a disgusting massages and an embarrassment to the United states bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shy stir and why are you are how many other women did you cheat on your wife with one you had a baby at home\n... the one who brought forth that third woman with the allegations of gang rape against Kavanaugh turned out to be completely unfounded\nAnd she had a moments later he went on to do each tens of millions of Americans are tired of your fraud allies in corruption they're equally tired of your attacks on women especially the ones\nWho you've had sex with wild cheating on your wives we have the UN are laughing at you and not with you\nSo Michael Avon out easily and I to me this is beneath the dignity of the office but the dignity of the officers long been gone since an intern named Monica Lewinsky was in there and our\nPrevious president decided he wanted to um well I think we know how that turned out\nSo reality this is coming off again as a federal judge dismissed story Daniels defamation lawsuit Michael ... lawyer the ruling stating that the president is entitled to legal fees from Daniels which according to the trouble lawyer Charles Harder will be determined at a later date\nI I don't really like watching the president have a Twitter war with a porn star ... attorney that I can think of\nAll I don't but nonetheless they're usually seems to be a method to his madness I don't know what it is they seems like a Fifteen year old to me\nThat being said I Can't farm or about the economy which now we have job openings hitting a record high up seven point one million we'd get great an African American unemployment at the lowest it's ever been in measured times in the country Hispanic female unemployment\nHe seems to be working towards border security and Medicare and coming up\nI don't know and he he by the way I didn't even get to which I could have I didn't even get to the Stormy Daniels tweets\nI was getting should I read those were not Stormy Daniels sorry the I'm\nLike God the Elizabeth Warren tweets okay let's all of those who are going to go to the phones will pick up a Tony Tony hold on I Know you want to comment on was with Warren's we'll get to that Pocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren getting slammed\nShe took a bogus DNA testing they showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American\nNow Cherokee Nation denies or DNA testing useless even they don't want her Sony\nNow that her claims of being Indian heritage you've turned out to be a scam and ally Elizabeth Warren should apologize prefer perpetrating this fraud against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing ... and would not have taken her otherwise\nThank you to the Cherokee Nation revealing get Elizabeth

warns Indian name was ...\n[noise] I thought it was focused on is\nThat that'll work [laughter] you know something else to [noise]\nAh I've seen on Fox News Lindsey Graham somebody may show him to shut it down here to kill the momentum that Republicans guy going right now he's talking about amnesty\nHe's talking about a ... they're going to make a deal they'll allow like maybe five billion dollars to build the wall but we gotta give amnesty to all the rules\nShe not understand thirty or forty million illegals would do to the voting here in this country\nWill you know what I I had not seen those comments I've seen all the other stuff he's got his news this morning on this I clearly had a very busy day so I meant that uh but nonetheless his other comments these ads for the last few months have been pretty good I guess I'm going to have to go back and see that's good that\nBut three weeks ago the congressional budget office which is the nonpartisan economists put a price tag on what we on the legislation that we pass\nThey said that in ten years because of this one point six trillion dollars and because of the financial mismanagement and the financial now the sense of the federal government\nAnd the inability of elected officials to balance those budgets\nWe're going to be spending in ten years more on the interest of our federal debt than ... than our military\nAnd so what what I can say in what I'm I've talked to a ... residents in the Texas congressional district about is that the financial policies of our federal government and more specifically the financial policy to Kevin Brady supports in his past\nIs actively compromising our national security in the future and I personally can't abide by that\nWhat was interesting and obviously being a Democrat in my suspicion is that you were probably supported Obama and his policies them I'm not sure with the U.S job openings now risen to a record high Justin in August so seven point one three six million\nNew jobs it looks like the economy is moving along pretty well above talking about national security with the Obama administration didn't have a real good record on that and of course is spending because that's something you're looking at the Obama administration as we know spend more money combined and all the previous presidents in in the past\nHow would you know as far as in your mind just by that compared to what you would do differently as far as fiscal responsibility\nSo what I can say that ... that I I don't I didn't run for office to defend President Obama's legacy I'm not running for office because I Want to recreate what President Obama did I Want to do what I think it was white\nAnd the lip service that I've heard Texans than Americans get from the federal government on both sides of the ... that we want to help out small businesses we want to help out middle class Americans when you look at this tax bill the majority of the money a large majority of the money went to corporations and as you know\nCorporations only employ forty three percent of American small businesses employ over half of Americans\nAnd we didn't get that money to them we didn't put the money back in the pockets of the middle class and so to to make I I agree with you we've created a whole bunch of jobs\nBut the concern that I have is at what cost if we're issuing the kind of got it's going to take a hundred years to pay off three generations to pay off is it really works for should we be smarter about how we issue that that and that's where I think that that the elected officials Kevin Brady including but also Democrats\nAs well have just really failed\nYou know I think we're complete agreement with with your writers politicians in general and failed this I did have one question I knew there was a debate coming up on October the twenties it Lone Star college and we'll talk about that just a second do one of the losers wanted me to ask you if you are elected infected UNC Kevin Brady here over the Texas a congressional district\nOne of the big questions that came up with a better O'Rourke into Ted Cruz race was the metro works said he would consider impeaching a President Trump and they wanted me to ask you the same question would you ... as far as would you be looking at impeachment for the president or would you be looking to work with the president\nI Would be looking at work for the president but I Would also be looking to follow the letter right there is clearly some sort of confusion and there's clearly some sort of hiding and playing the game\nOr whether it's directly by President Trump or by his colleagues and the people who work for him I don't know\nBut I absolutely support I worked with public safety for years at the city in Houston and I fully believe in allowing investigators have an uninhabited investigation and if it turns out that President Trump did anything didn't do anything at all no I wouldn't vote to impeach him but it turned out that he broke the law that we need to have that conversation\n... married to him now before we run out and say I want to make sure we talked about this coming up the on October the twentieth and nine thirty am over Lone Star college which is thirty two hundred calls bar drive over in the ... there was a big debate tell us about this debate because I Know you're going to be

impeachment\nOh I'm In job openings hit a new record highs seven but one million already got stick around I'll give you the information on how to call in when the tickets are short like let's go to Jennifer who's actually holding in spring Jennifer thank you for hanging on welcome to the voice from Texas\nWell thank you and I am going to be a gallon today arms okay and the lady that we're talking about eight hours a day he around commercial I Want to know how come they think they're going to get a dollar and yet the words I Love it\nOh I Know what you're talking about that commercial rates faces writing the camera and he's got he's got either some sort of acne or I don't want to say\nThat it could be multiple social disease by the way speaking of social diseases I just don't object Dennis off the guy who\nRan was a cat house or those ... those legal brothels with the Trump supporter was running for office apparently has died so who knows what that's where I went back to your point is you're going to be your only a little bit superficial here and you don't\nFigure why didn't they put some makeup and cover up whatever it was on his lips is that what you're saying some\nChips or an honors time do I change the dude\nRaised thirty eight and a half a million dollars in the last quarter they could have got some something to cover that up with right\nYeah I Know that he's not having to voters right there\nProbably into the funny thing is all that money he's raised which brings up a good point\nIs he's raised thirty eight million dollars plus I Wonder how much of that money because we know a lot of it has come from a California New York Hollywood these left these like Rosie O'Donnell in Ellen DeGeneres in all of them have been donating his campaign he goes on Ellen show\nRosie O'Donnell in Ellen DeGeneres in all of them have been donating his campaign he goes on to Ellen show and some of these others so this dude is bringing in a whole lot of money out of state to try to turn our Texas blue\nNope not gonna happen\nIs that what you're saying is is that the so the only reason you're not going to vote for Beto is because the minute he didn't putting us lives is that what you're telling me I Know\nHe had no policy\n[noise] yeah no he actually he does and it's terrible he doesn't talk about them in the commercials because he knows how bad it is and he would have no chance of winning if he actually did\nYeah in fact you can see how he tries to mimic Obama in America I mean the way he taught me how now the way you don't get home and\nYou know it's funny I think for the call Jennifer and things for bringing that up now got to think about that\nThanks a lot Jennifer [laughter] no but you're right he's been you can tell he's tried to schools himself in the school of a bottle of politics because that's very effective with Democrats\nDemocrats don't care about substance more than they do about style remember cool bomber was and that's all that mattered didn't care that he spent more than all the other presidents combined they didn't care about that they didn't care of the economy stopped\nThey didn't care about our foreign policy what was going on with the Arab Spring and what happened in many guys the and they didn't care that he lied to us about our health care and they didn't care that he lied about fast and furious\nAnd exerted executive privilege they didn't care about any of that\nHe just looked really cool and he said at the moment when he was biracial and clearly in the Democratic party they no longer follow the methodology of what Martin Luther king preached content to someone's character not the color of their skin\nThe Democratic party is the exact opposite now\nAnd you're right that's exactly how best to always tried to coach himself he's he's trying to ... which is generally smart if you're gonna do you want to be successful following successful model look how successful that he's been\nWas Democrat fundraising and as you can do enough to unseat Ted Cruz I don't think so\nBy the way I haven't mentioned today are coming up next Monday if I can I'm going to go cover the event a Trump is coming to energy stadium right here in Houston to campaign with Ted Cruz big event taking place I imagine the tickets are probably already gone by now but if not you can go check it out let's go to Gary who's been holding in spring Gary thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice from Texas\nThat you know the problem is that even if it came out here is my problem\nHe says the right thing and say they work for this is a lot of that as\nA valid but it seems that work somewhere in that instant never had a better there than most on balance but at a a man that's a pattern that we have a one of them anyway but here's the problem that I\nRead history\nHe wants to run and the latest mistake they made is is a Democrat I don't trust day\nIf you don't come in and out or in history and even if that for the Democrat I Do not know one democratic\nAnywhere who's interested in data thing any budget who's interested and even how the guy on account on this station\nAt convinced of that either law abiding constitutional Democrat when nobody in the Democratic party would even have it so I think they're trying to run like\nSkiing all that and I don't trust the man it nobody said it but\nI mean what am I thought you said in the right thing but this guy is interested in anything but just how they're getting it out for some political purposes but I don't see any but you haven't come over here and there are Democrats I'm not without I'd rather it with\nKevin ... at least I got to get out of it at a few of them they don't even know I never heard of it\nAnd all that you know the constitution of getting me a break\nFor the call a good point you're right we've seen that many many times with a lot of these are the Democrats we've seen it was a Republican to me they say one thing they do another now elected we don't know how exactly he would he would do as a congressman but you're right you can look at the city of Houston and see what mayor a previous mayor\nThese Parker which she did as they were running deposition runners spending money they didn't have it now they we got this rainwater tax and nobody knows where the hell that money went\nBecause no one can tell them tonight I'm gonna I'm gonna have to reach out to my ... and get him back on the program 'cause it's been wants to talk to Mike\nBut none of those there's rainwater taxes there ... there were going to get again regardless did they did this and we didn't get to vote on that or are we did but they lied about it went to court and then she just decided to well you know what maybe we're we're broke and we're going to ... we got the mayor now mayor Turner's going to have to cut jobs and put all of these things and\nWe'll do we're going to eliminate believes insurances have you vote for raised for the fire department\nUm we had money you know we're\nOkay and then once I mentioned in these Parker she found money to give same sex benefits partners we get a vote on she lied about it and then trying to conceal the fact that voters wanted to vote on it [noise] okay so when you're talking about just on the Democrats in the city of Houston and that was when Steven was over there I'm sure he had nothing to do that\nBut nonetheless and that was what was going on there and nuts to leaders of the part of Hillary Clinton but rock Obama\nChuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi\nI mean not said let's go to Marie we're run out of time here Murray thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nI'm driving anyway if they get paid and how he's trying to do and I thought well\nWe'll talk about that uh so uh but nonetheless a lotta people don't know the media refuses to covered I wanted to touch on that oh by the way you want to join us want to get in before run out of time of Donald Trump has already raised over a hundred million for his reelection wow still got a little ways to go\nFor twenty twenty but it's going to be here before you know we'll get into that as well and we want to talk about um the jobs\nYou have the J obey ass job openings at a new record I have seven point one million if you want to get in you want to join us to a one five five eight K. STV that to a one five five eight five seven three eight if you want to weigh in\nWhen you get into this okay so Trump stopped all that bad and his own fundraising hundred million dollars and as we're looking at speaking of money we've had a lot of the debate about the economy\nAnd the economy will years so these Democrats keep telling his old people aren't getting raises but they're not the quality things aren't but no\nI got a raise loner phrase that I didn't get a raise I got more my money back\nThat tax cut affected me I work for small business I got more money in my paycheck thanks to Donald Trump he for the Republicans to do it and now he's gone through ... let me for some Republicans to work with that and they bringing jobs and we know the unemployment is at the lowest it's been since what last forty two years something like this\nNow we see that the U.S job openings rose to a new record high in August an indication that US Economy continued to expand rapidly as the trade war with China has escalated\nJob openings in labor turnover survey on Joel says what they call it the Labor Department said on Tuesday job openings have risen just seven point once every six million jobs\nEconomist it forecast a six point nine million so more everything we economists forecasted his turned out Trump his top those numbers this Trump ... if you will who by the way okay\nIt

fifty nine I still call it fifty nine I'm not going to call it sixty nine\nI'm not I'm not going to do it\nI don't care what the other people say I'm calling in fifty nine\nAlright if for some reason

are now going to be coming up to ... between innings arrows are losing two to one amongst rose\nI'll give you an update here ... as we were allowed to the program do the monthly job openings in labor turnover survey has issued a job openings rose seven point one three six million seven point one million jobs when economists had forecast only six point nine million which is incredible\nThe prior month was revised up seven point zero seven seven million for the first time this number has ever exceeded seven million until April twenty Seventeen there's never been more than six million job openings\nJob openings or a measure of the labor demand non farm payrolls have increased an average of two hundred and one thousand over the last twelve months unemployment is fall into a three point seven percent a number in September\n... is one of the job market metrics that a closely watched by the Federal Reserve economists expect to U.S Central bank will announce another rate hike in December\nA move federal official described as normalizing interest rates now we don't always loved that if you're looking to go buy a home or by something when those interest rates go up that costs you a little bit more money but once again it shows more ...\nRemember they kept thinking about it and they could never rate the rate during the Obama administration because the economy never stabilized do data eight years to stabilize the economy he never did it in fact not only did he not do it then you wouldn't do that every one it's never going to be over three percent\nOf GDP is never going to happen is the new normal everything was the new normal with Obama\nEverything he had\nInhibited job growth\n[noise] um fear is that the central bank rates up too rapidly have recently causal turmoil in the um the stock market President Trump has criticized the feds rate hikes oh because it ... the banks tagging policy\nThe number ... and August reached a five point eight million there were four hundred and eighty eight thousand jobs they can see in manufacturing in August a slight decline\nFrom july's four hundred and Ninety six thousand vacancies in construction rose by twelve thousand up to two hundred Ninety eight thousand professional in business services opening leaped to one point three million\nMy laptop one point three million from one point two million\nSo the

pocket thanks to a tax cuts only in Democrat will tell you that a tax cut is a bad thing\nBecause that means they get less of your money to spend on what they want to spend it on compared to what you
