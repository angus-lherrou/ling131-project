favor\nA team that has a returning champion and especially if they're playing around with which has got me mad when rockets weren't a big win African FIRST Championship against a team and um Orlando

of garbage\nI don't even know does it even matter that was if they're talking about putting a U.S who was it was it made you hear on the cabin that scan a hat\nAnd ... you know you should have an exclamation point next to you for being that dopey of senator\nHow can you be that clueless you're ready to ruin a man for an substantiated thinks he's a Republican how do you think you guys ready to put a stamp or or uh an asterisk next to a Bill Clinton's presidency last\nI heard he was the only one um [noise] well we'll just say he had a little action was an intern in the oval office and that wasn't it remember the war on women he committed even before he was elected [noise] yeah\nActually code name Energizer is and then you guys get back on that one\nSo we'll get back to this okay so in the first thing that we talked about over the weekend in a Twitter Rand you had this clown over Google he's the design lead in San Francisco\nBlamed Republicans will descend into the flames of hell and describe GOP members as treason is an evil following the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh the nerve those monsters to appoint a guy that went through the process exactly right and then was\nConfirmed\nIt's all about power and if you don't believe in the area will do much or is it do moss or is a dumb ass I'm not sure you pronounce it writer for Stephen Colbert tweeted out whatever happens which just lab we've ruined a man's life regarding Brett Kavanaugh\nThey wonder why they're shows suck and they're not funny what did I tell you guys last week we're the enemy to these people and they will do whatever they can to destroy us or in the short anyone who gets in the way\n\nSo it was funny in a question over at the American thinker um which says oh why are Republicans indeed some people everywhere celebrating the Senate confirmation a Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh lots of reasons but one of them is the tweet the writer for the call Mary show or board that I just told you about\nAnd a a a writer who was Sam road I treated out this is all they cared about from the beginning\nHow did our politics gets so poisonous\nAmos recall there how did how did that happen\nThe writer of this voucher we'd have is a writer for the Stephen Colbert show has nearly forty thousand Twitter followers are as the Senate confirmation was gearing up she didn't want everyone to know whatever happens she just relax you ruined a man's life\nNever mind if he was innocent never mind any of the facts are cooperation are shifting stories of his accuser and the important thing to her was ruining his life that's what mattered\nAnd that's what matters to the left\nGlenn Reynolds uh in in the pundits had in a well an apt characterization of what this amounted to light the match used to a mobster the face of the false rate accusations weren't personal they were just business but Kavanaugh may feel differently\n[noise] which is already gotten to the skin of moderate to now former Democrats on Twitter\nAnother when Vince ... are you do realize this is exactly why those of us who used to be left leaning on are now running from you\nI helped get out the vote for Obama supported Bernie and now I hashtags walk away I don't want to be associated with this base hatred intolerance an inability to treat people like people\nIn other words impact weeded out that's only because you're a terrible person in karma Israel to the writer overt Kobe or report now he's the Supreme Court justice how 'bout you Bob Seymour asked\nAnd then another one Marty Arnold said I think they're giving themselves a little too much credit he now Supreme Court justice justice and she's stuck in the world of a coward that had the locker Twitter account advantage Kevin why is that because it's a good nutshell summary of all the thinking\nOf the left it's mounted ever crazier and Moran verifiable the attacks of what was obviously a blameless man\nIt's clear there was nothing Kevin Hi Don didn't matter they don't care\nThey wanted a ruined him for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and because he was nominated by a president of Eva lost their minds over they don't care about truth\nThey don't care about justice they just wanted to ruin him\nNo due to get a truck stop him from doing anything and that sums up the entire problem with the Democrats as they try to dig out from their own rubble or from the mid coming in terms of the upcoming the terms the less game has been revealed ingest that tweet Damascus off in one can only hope that voters remember\nCome November\nI agree do you guys you guys don't pay attention I Know there's I've got a lot of friends there all excited about voting\nAnd some of them getting registered with the first time in years\nThose watching over on the Facebook page K C B am seven hundred the voice of Texas remember which screen the program live on our Facebook page you want to go on over and watch the program there you can do it if you're not driving you can also jump in and tell me how are you excited about voting\nWhich way you get a vote in November of this year you realize it's coming up here in a month less than a month now\nThey know there's very few and far between working surely will go out and harassing people for nothing that's\nThe Democrats in his party have been harassing people including in restaurants in an open places including minorities African Americans and Asians and Hispanics for very long time in this country is really is it knew it just seems new because they're hiding it under the guise of liberalism these ... who's\nThe black lives matter all these people you talked about paid we now know there was a woman on was the new method we see this weekend I saw the clip she went on I was talking about yeah absolutely certain we know the lady that confronted a Jeff like in the elevator is paid by George Soros one company these a lot of these protesters are paid\nThey don't have jobs or anything else to do they're being paid to go off in protest to be whatever they are they're paid to create this sense\nIt's what they do\nThe reality is the vast majority of people in this country my better things to do the vast majority of people in this country have jobs in lives and aren't going to go out and get paid to go create dissension people like George Soros\nPeople like ... around oh even like Cory Booker people like Dick Durbin people like Schumacher Schumer these people\nOnly got about is power so all they care about I don't hear about you

Illinois\nYeah and I don't know a lot of our voice you have nothing to do it right\nThe reality is they give us a call ... you're you're absolutely right there there are cases of racism in this country and I think they're few and far between we know what happens but the reality is the vast majority of police officers are not racist the reality is we have it leads to more police officers that were murdered this weekend there were two more there were murdered last week or two that were alerted the week before they're\nThey're dying at an alarming rate because what's happening is those guys on the left and we were just talking about the divide and conquer can also divided the African American community and the poor community\nFrom the police and they've made out what it meant to say the new Jim Crow was the police the police or the new Jim Crow that's exactly what they're doing that divide and conquer this has led to the death of a lot of police officers this case you're talking about in Chicago where this kid got shot the kid had a knife\nOkay he wasn't complying with the police and the guy shot him in my personal opinion police officer ... out there I don't understand why do you in the sixteen bulletin of the kid doesn't make any sense to me\nThat means that the kid I had a knife and he wouldn't put it down and in any given moment he could murder himself someone else or ... or worse the police officer I'm going to side with the police generally\nSaw the video so the kid if you do not comply with police now that being said I don't know all the details I really don't\nI just know what I saw once again they they called it you know murder or whatever I'm pretty sure at the beginning of the day this police officer did not set out to murder a black kid\nI'm pretty sure about it but the fact that he was white the reality is if you go look at the statistics which can be easily found on the inter webs from legitimate sources you'll see the police officers kill far more white people\nThan any other race\nNext to that is Hispanic followed by African Americans\nSupport your theory Leo you point is and then and I'm Glad to hear you say your former Democrat and you've left because unless you're a socialist Marxist full of hate and totalitarian there's no place for you and the Democratic party anymore\nThey don't care about you\nUnless you agree with them they've made it very clearly that you don't they may send roving mobs of people to intimidate you into doing what they want you to do that sound like America I remember a time in our past whenever roving bands of Democrats they would show up and burn crosses an African American people's yards\nAnd they would take out Lynch people generally those were Democrats now don't time there's more than just that\nThe Democrat parties who formed the Ku Klux Klan\nPeople don't know this oh you can't say that yes yes we can there was a time um what was it um in our past when you look at the way that African Americans are treated it was terrible when I see roving mobs of people screaming in a family or someone trying to go have just a dinner\nI don't care if it's someone I despise I Would never\nEver condone that behavior\nThe only person who deserves that is the person who thinks that's okay\nIf you think it's okay for roving bands of thugs and mobs of people to torture and harass other people you deserve that treatment you really only one who deserves that treatment said you were the Galileo great points let's go to Dr ... listening in Bel Air thanks for holding on duct Chris welcome to the voice of taxes\nThat as a new show how are you hungry it's always good to talk with you I'm with a\nA R contemplated is over the weekend and I thought about it and and I know in my heart I'm not wrong and John McCain stupid and the Senate you would not confirmation for a for Jewish Kevin you would not have gotten it because the uh the he would he would have sided with the Democrats\nAnd Makovsky and Collins and all those are those are never Trump Republicans\nAnd those who who love to uh to to hate this president would have sided with him they would have lined up behind me if this is a war horse is over a quote unquote lion of the famous now is a good friend Kennedy was deceased he\nWould have just like he stopped the repeal and replace Obamacare he would he would have a much enough courage and and those people to fight with him and he would stop this would've stopped if if a if a if a confirmation\nHe would have done it and he would he would not have been apologetic about it\nYou know that ...\nYou know something I was thinking about it you know from George Soros says in those nasty feminists are protesters by the town a well all I got to say is gonna be you know what I got to say about it he's going to be broke\nSurgery so bad [laughter]\nOh I Know but to take a look you know I Believe there is a nasty and or is there and then there's the communist and a magnet man Ali Madame ... you know hit them back [laughter]\nYou know one should be laying hands on anyone in the point you're making when we're talking about paying\nWe talked about this a little bit you got people like George source of these groups that he said he gets literally billions of dollars to that are paying these people to create the sense does the yell scream and go yellow Jeff Flake in the elevator to go to these protests cause problems create dissension great strides\nThese groups are paying them these people aren't just quote organic grassroots their astro turf they're being paid to get out and creating problems and that's that's a dangerous situation that can lead to really bad things you\nKnow I've been I Believe that the state capital there in the Oscar and they you know something you know walk or something big going on there and not watch the Democrats are many buses they ship here\nAnd watch all the all the pay ... off the bus is you know and these people they have to be stopped I mean\nIt's time for the hard working man to get out there and stop this crap because you know and another thing is you know something I never understood as hell to somebody will figure who vote\nThat set it blows my mind I think if you're on welfare you know have a right to vote because you're not contributing to society or to treat contributing to taxes or anything you should take or you're not you you know\nYou're not going to be fair does it don't do anything for the call appreciate it you're right if you make some good points I mean if you don't own anything and you're on welfare and you're getting money from the government\nYou you don't have any skin in the game all you're doing is just getting paid you're just getting money it seems like you shouldn't really ... and we can't will never go back to the old days remember back in the old days when you had to be a property owner devote oh man trying to do that\nProperty owners understand taxes they get paid them\nProperty owners have skin in the game they have a vested interest in this country unlike some on washed member of the masses gets paid Fifteen dollars an hour or whatever it is\nTo get on a bus to go somewhere and jump out and screaming people it's a little different\nThat being said much any ... or to go back to the point that we got to stop and you're absolutely right one voting too is I said this was a program wasn't last week the week before who who are us to think that we shouldn't have to fight equally as hard as our forefathers did give us this republic\nThey thought they lead and they work very hard to bring us a republic and Benjamin Franklin told us what you what do you have you ever Republican you can keep it we have to fight just as hard now I'm not saying ... I'm ... you know figuratively\nOr we need to do is look we need to counter protests we need all that stuff not violently we need to go out and let our voices be heard which is why we're here and I think it's a great idea we need to be just as active thank you for the call let's go to Bob in Alvin Bob thanks for hanging on will do the voice of Texas\nIs a good thing um\nI got up on point like on the back story for that that Murkowski the\nSo called Republican senator from Alaska they only one who voted against a compilation of a justice of the coin is that the way that are running for re election as the\nAlaska last primaries in honor lighting\nA item is that a a four hour week like ... have a the Alaska governor they signed on for that\nIf it were I don't I don't agree with it on a crowded Republican if it was a Democrat and a lot of it was a Republican and she beat him in a constellation and uh in the primaries or what\nIt might come up in my mind I was a shirt on on the face of the previous caller earlier prior to that\nThey had such a razor margin\nNow aren't fully won't be in the future that I wanted it whether he had to go out to go along with a a word for it and she ended allegations\nHave such a lot that they couldn't afford to go out\nAnd say this\nI'm Sorry you have that guy with a lady out any of their uh around here they it further on me that\nWhen they when they go and they had to be that week and I think a lot of the fact that a Republican votes stand a lot of them\nYeah how do you not only that he was called but you're right that was a very thin margin and they didn't have room to lose a few votes and once again people tend to forget that you know it's easy for us to sit there and say oh you're an idiot you know what you're talking about a year you're wrong you're not right I'm going to be\nThis way will the reality is is politics is about compromise so they had to compromise on something clearly the Republicans won this compromise because the Democrats didn't want to compromise on anything\nThey kept calling for delayed delayed delayed it wanted to keep delaying they want to get they wanted to do everything to get in the south and the Republicans were long enough to keep like on board and a couple of others it looks like he may have been run in California we won't know all the ... going on\nBut clearly whenever they did they did it right every car James Robert Scott you guys hang on we'll get you on the other side of the break you're listening to critics radio here on the voice of Texas and seven hundred K.
