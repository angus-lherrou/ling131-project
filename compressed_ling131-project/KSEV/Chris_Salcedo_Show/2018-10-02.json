I remember when Obama was president and you weren't supposed didn't say anything about the kids\nWhy can't remember when Bush was president it was okay to make fun of the kids because they were drinking and doing things but then the bottles and you can't make fun of the kids oh wait hold on these Republican you can make fun of the kids all you want\nAlso today um we've got Beto O'Rourke his Senate campaign was flying by the federal elections commission on Sunday for accepting excessive and in permissible donations\nLike why it's\nSo made oh little roar gets taken away money from illegal sources no Democrats never knew that that never happened oh wait may do it in every election isn't it funny how that works out\nWell remember that um do national Sousa made an illegal contribution and they met when they do that but that he was on house arrest for a while or whatever you need from the book that guy\nHe's also now shamed of demeaning comments he made about women back in Nineteen Ninety One he wrote about in college in fact we're going to talk about that right now so Mr O'Rourke has apologized and that would be Robert Francis or need to go back to back then I don't know\nBut he did apologize for an article he wrote back in Nineteen Ninety One he uh use the byline Robert O'Rourke so he didn't go back though\nIn the Columbia daily spectator that wrote female cast members and will Rogers Follies were quote permit smile actresses who's only qualifications seemed to me they're phenomenally large brass and tight muddy ducks\n[noise]\nYeah this is this is an article you wrote in college and I guess does it sheds light on the way he felt about women during that time of his life\nAs ... as Mr Roberto roared does he drink beer too because we drink beer he's clearly not ... Devi like beer I only like water burger I've got that in common with them because I Love me tomorrow murder you can't go wrong with water\nBut it's so Mr O'Rourke anyway he was right and that's according to a report by Politico when he was Nineteen years old and a student at a student at Columbia University he reviewed the Broadway musical will Rogers Follies in ... pegged it as ostentatious ... field tradition\nThere was a little more than one boring pointless song and dance number after another\nAh this was in the daily student newspaper called the Columbia daily spectator\nYou know what honestly I have to agree with his that's been so far right there with them right now ... write the tractor being boom right there\nI true would probably call it ostentatious a little more than one bull ring pointless song and dance number after another\nThat's correct and you know I Can't I Can't even imagine the you know especially if you've already heard the news about what happened at the Pentagon and the you know the ... the thing I haven't figured out yet is they said that these aren't workers that\nFor them from the campaign office so that was somebody else it was there so I'm not sure exactly how they got exposed to a envelope being open that arrived in the mail but uh I guess more informational come out about that pretty soon but I can I can certainly understand why somebody would all of a sudden\nYou know your nerves at you and you'd be scared and\nI was able to certainly be a understandable feelings so they took him to the hospital and I haven't heard any word yet as to if they'd been treated were released or just examined or or what their situation is but I assume well here's something later today about that\nAnd then once again we do we still don't even know what the ... was there saying it wasn't rice in or something that was dangerous it looks like so who knows but you're absolutely right we usually just a white powdery such that's\nOK yeah just to wipe out or something so we seen cases in the past where people have something like this uh the mere thought of that would make you sick to your stomach and that could lead to a just like you mentioned in knowing right from the center earlier in the news the Pentagon I'm Bob ... the other thing I wanted to touch when we're talking with Bob price associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart taxes\nBob one you've done and and I I always appreciate your work and what you've done you've covered wasn't going dog going down on our southern border of Texas over and over and over again and it's I Know probably sometimes you may feel like you're yelling at a Wal Mart the different ... one of the article you had I guess when he was even earlier today\nApprehensions of Bangladeshis and the Texas border sector up two hundred and Seventy percent you're constantly covering the different stories about rescue migrants who were down there on the border that would basically die they weren't rescued [noise]\nDo you ever feel like you're just screaming at a at a wall and no one's listening\nYou know I Wish the wall was there that I could scream at it than that would\nSolve a lot of these problems or you know the areas of the water where we have a wall it works very effectively at virtually stops Ninety five percent of any crossings in those areas\nAnd and we need to get under on the way of getting that felt there right now replacing a four mile section of just chain link fence in El Paso let's uh Eighteen foot ball or wall and and that'll be good in there because the\nGovernment is having to spend a lot of time and a lot of money to a lot of resources preparing that chain link fence which is very easy to breach\nYeah no you're absolutely right um I Know you you've written an article about border patrol agents against it was over in Arizona a busted a kidnapper and some sex offenders we see multiple sex offenders repeat sex offenders admitted time were deported in a ride back across the border here in Texas and now we're finding a lot of these uh we ends I guess there it looks like they're up\nThis year for fiscal year twenty Eighteen with the Bangladeshis does it from your opinion I Know there was a law where were curtailed to bed at the border but it looks like the looks like we're getting many many many people come across that border right now doesn't look like it slow down\nWell we are getting massive numbers of the the Bangladeshis that you mentioned crafts are her extremely important for people to pay attention to this was a six hundred and sixty eight\nBangladeshi mostly young men between the ages of Eighteen and thirty five to pay these drug cartels up to twenty seven thousand dollars each to be smuggled from their home country in the south or Central America up through Mexico and\nInto the lower rate of sector this is just one small sector where where you saw this and lots of six hundred and sixty eight by Bangladesh nationals coming across first off why are they getting that money and second of all why would\nSomeone a young man between the ages of Eighteen and thirty five pay twenty five thousand twenty seven thousand dollars\nTo be smuggled into the United states if you had that kind of cash you can she can get visas by making capital investment\nYou know there's there's ways are getting here um that these guys are all being smuggled by the cartels through a very specific area it's not just that she was the same area we've seen Syria's we've seen Iranians or other people from countries with\nVery strong ties to terrorism and that should be of concern to everybody regardless of what you think about President Trump than the wall\nIf these kind of people can come here and let's assume that all six hundred and sixty eight of the Bangladeshis are coming here for\nSome kind of legitimate jobs you know they want a better life their family or for that well guess what if they can make that trip any terrorists that wants to create a situation of mass destruction and also make the same trip\nYeah it just on his union if if I read the article earlier this week correctly what was it something like the the number of Indian migrants you come across the border just in this year alone has tripled something like nine thousand Indian migrants coming across that border\nYes and that was that's in a very matter of three mile wide section of the border in Southern California nine thousand people from India that have paid I think in those cases they were saying after about twenty to twenty five thousand dollars to come here and a lot of cases\nThey're not paying that money up front they're coming here with a debt\nAnd they have to be working that off as indentured surface in the indentured servitude industry which is another word for slavery\nUm they're human traffic into the hospitality industry and the convenience store industry into other places around the country where they're forced to work off this that not only for the the transportation fees to get here but also for the cost of\nThe visa that they use to initially get 'em here you know it it's it's a horrific situation you know this is\nA couple of sheriffs along the border of called this the false compassion from the left of open borders there's nothing compassionate about our borders situation it leads to the exploitation of people like these Indians people like the Central Americans that are\nBeing smuggled up here by the cartels under\nDebt tremendous\nSmuggled up here by the cartels under tremendous\nTremendous revenue for the cartels and if you look at at the the fact you know these\nParticularly at the Central American families that are coming up here on the other company had miners they could present themselves at any point of entry and claim asylum if that's what they're wanting to do but they're illegally crossing\nAnd then turning themselves in most cases to the first available law enforcement officer they can find usually a border patrol agent\nWhy because that ties up the border patrol resources for hours as they have to process these people the drug cartels know that if they can afford the area was a couple of hundred migrants across the border and tie up the entire sector a border patrol ages\nThey can go right up the river and bring across either they're loaded drugs or what they called her high value targets the people that are paying them twenty five thousand dollars to get smuggled across the border and get smuggled into the United states that people that are not want to be caught those are ... what's going on\nWhen you see these big groups of people crossing the border and so they learn how to do this now in South Texas they've been doing this as two thousand fourteen the massive numbers now you're seeing a out in places\nLike Arizona desert in the in the Tucson sector and the in the human factor a massive increases and the numbers a hundred and twenty four percent I Believe it was increasing the number of family is crossing in the desert in the middle of the summer with inadequate water and their adequate food\nAnd the um human smugglers or just marching them into the desert and it's amazing you know we've had almost a three hundred died this year or so amazing that that number hasn't been much higher than that\n[noise] it's

live Monday through Thursday\nForty six PM right here in Texas you can always listen aim seven hundred new happen if you want to watch the video you can check it out I've also posted a poll today while you're watching the video scroll amounts of the screen you'll see it pop up in the upper right hand corner and the poll today is\nShould the Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh this week with all these allegations crumbling\nShould they just go ahead and go to confirm here at the end of the week like they were supposed to [noise]\nUh right now I'm the yeses or Ninety seven percent to three percent on the nose so\nIt looks like people are leaning towards confirming let's go away by the way we are going to get to a Jewish sweating to third Kavanaugh accuser represented by Michael ... she was on NBC last night she is changing parts of her story and isn't it interesting how these allegations are just sort of falling apart\nWe'll get to that and what her ex boyfriend had to say as well so we can dig into that let's go right back to the phones to anyone five I'm a K C B let's begin with Mike who's holding out in Cyprus Mike thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey good afternoon Chris he um the interesting thing that I think a lot of people misunderstood\nIt was when Kavanaugh made reference to Clinton I don't think they made that connection they felt that it was because Clinton lost only sixteen election uh most people do not know that that Cabot was on can start\nInvesting investigation team back when you're whitewater with being investigated so the reference to Hillary Clinton or revenge by the Clinton I think goes all the way back to the mid to late nineties\nIt gets to cynically from what I what I was able to find even the individual that investigated and talk to you so\nYou know foster became a lightning rod later on especially on the urban legend that he was shot twice in the way I think there's a bigger a bigger story there then people generally under ...\nThat way I think there's a bigger a bigger story there that people generally understand and the other thing I Would say that that the lake or get like insistence on an FBI investigation is a pot of gold for the Republican\nI'm I think that Mitch McConnell will hold together most of his contingency but the place where you can really pick up the votes or the ... immigrants like Joe Manchin Donnelly up in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri because\nBrett Kavanaugh I think on a rated completely if they don't vote to confirm they're not going to be in the Senate and said you will be able to carry the water it will be game over for him so this is a blessing in disguise make the most\nMen are actually gone my good points you made me dead on\nWhen I first heard about the um the delay by the Democrats I'm like okay you know if they do I just when we we know what they're doing it stall and install tactics over and over and over again that's all they're doing they just want to do and get it passed them in terms\nBut nonetheless like you said they get it out for a week they investigate they find nothing in and virtually absolve ... nothing is going to appease the Democrats are absolutely right they don't care Mike and they're not gonna ever vote for him no matter what they've already said so so in other words\nThis didn't matter and this was an attempt to get more information to try to change some of these neatly\nRepublicans as you mentioned mansion and and our our friend flick that everybody just loves so much none of us will see but you're right if they find nothing\nHe'd Merck and then they still don't love for them they're literally throwing their their Senate seat to the wolves and I think you're dead on good points I appreciate it already too late one five five eight KFC me let's go to Randy also listening in Cyprus Randy thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nAre you for having me I'm Talking about things\nThat are not personally I feel that ah when you see what we're in a cabinet our right on the list of other conservative judges years ago I think every single one of the conservative judges afford regular warning I think that\nThey um the Democratic party already have ... ... people that went to school with all the ah Arabic they've already got stories route route all live in Hollywood Land so um\nThat and hope that without hearing was bad I think if you got you found out who bailed out the whole hundred and some people are going to try it out there was a way they're\nAfraid that a way I could go on our on\nOur solar all it's all bankrupted\nThe fact that she didn't tell her therapist um tells me that they tell them that they say look if you get it on record he went to a therapist\nAlready been touched by someone to get it out there are record and then it because they don't trust the therapist I I think if you found out that she went through a therapist for Twenty years and didn't tell but we're feller him or her their assault at all\nI could believe her story on that but the fact I think you'll find that she was told to go to a therapist go to a therapist but didn't trust there so if it\nDon't put a name to it and then they'll come out later with it I think that the goal but part of our orders we've got a bunch of old Republican fair or worse\nOff of your you know ...\nMaybe right because we're looking at and actually go Randy because we're looking at it's\nA situation where this woman contacted Dianne Feinstein and then we we know there was some sort of you want to go with collusion going on because Diane hooked him up with the hooked up with a couple of good pro bono attorneys and all of them okay every single ... attorneys andme a sport or Democrat activist okay\nThey're part of the resistance which includes Dianne Feinstein and every single one of those Democrats they're part of the resistance\nThey've made it very clear they want to get through them in terms of power in a beach Trump if they get to the midterms without this nomination than he can appoint anyone to the Supreme Court and then they're in control there in town it's clear as day so\nOnce again there's no telling at one point this woman was\nApproached or whatever maybe she did it on her own I don't know maybe she's crazy maybe maybe she was attacked someone but it's clear at this point there was absolutely no one who can confirm that might or Mr Cavanaugh a um was was anywhere near that\nAnd that goes for Michael ... um the third accuser whose story is changing and falling apart as we speak and she goes on NBC News and then she did yesterday thank you for the call let's go to blue listening in West Houston St Louis thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of taxes\nYeah Hi Chris I got a quick song Kevin out doesn't make the Supreme Court Trump needs to ah make him the attorney general\nMan boy you can talk about the resistance they lose their minds ... chair than Democrats [laughter]\n'cause you know the funny thing to do that you really do believe that that's an interesting thought offer those have you did you guys get to catch any of Trump's um his his press conference yesterday that presser gays or he was talking and he said hey listen these Democrats there are not angels these are not good people\nHe knows them he's known them for thirty forty years these people he knows about Cory Booker in what he's done he knows about the lives Blumenthal told in the cold I'm Out\nHe knows exactly what these be Dianne Feinstein added Chinese spy driving your car for Twenty years Twenty years and this guy was going on her behalf to these events owner\nOnce again these people clearly are interested in power\nAnd only power you've got to look at Capitol Harris who she what's his name Brown's ferry he was our main squeezed thirty ... Thirty years or junior and he pulled their on well they had their fair and these to once again now they're all of a sudden there were these pure perjury in\nLike for the echo jeopardy but I'm a I'm yeah if you if wonderful if you get that little microphone button says a lot of space for and just you know speak the words a recess appointment\nAnd ... and Google\n'em all those people they were crying after the election even they'll come up and tell ya I ah yeah the president can recess appoint a Supreme Court judge in the last one that did it was white eyes power with uh John Brennan\nAnd then\nShe brought up with the media idiot goes on to say that Obama and fatter and published all the opinions about outright he thought it was how he was going to use it\nSo yeah I think okay let's just you know what the what used to cry and after a little field an ax you know bought him a thing but let them you know hack off voters what them a bit of ... on a\nElection day and then that after the election I think Trump auto yeah put salt or just ...\nYeah I'm I ... at this point in your care but we we can ... too because it's not always accurate but not being Sarah most most would you send the data on up and give us a call appreciated Daryl I Want to go back you're right it's not if you do a little research in a lot of people it's I guess a lot of people aren't necessarily suit and doing\nYou know research on line for this kind of stuff but it when it comes with in this day and age we need to be more active part of our constituency in other words we gotta get back into just as active as they are kind of stuck with a lot of work\nPeople like me love it because I'm a talk show host I have no problem doing this research I love it it's it's what I enjoy doing I like to study this\nBut the average person when you've got a wife and you've got kids or husband and children and you got your taking the soccer practice or whatever it is difficult and it's hard a lot of people really get upset the trick is don't get too upset get energized\nGet motivated and it would do exactly what you said research it research it as best you can from legitimate authorities if you look hard enough you'll start learning\nThem it's hard to do because there's a lot of big news out there just tons of it\nBut you speaking of fake news when he will go right back to the phones Michael hang on we get ... as well so ms Julie sweating exerting Kavanaugh's accuser represented by Mr Michael ... a change some of her story last night on NBC News she walked back some of our biggest claims\nNow Kate Snow the NBC News anchor the reporter that did the story last night said they could not verify any of her salacious claims before they highlighted her claims during an interview last night didn't stop him from putting their own today\nShe had claimed before she became aware of efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others despite the punch it house parties she noted in that NBC interview that sweating they claimed she solve them near the punch but never actually saw them spike it with alcohol [noise]\nNBC News also noted that sweating compared to change your initial statement about cabinet being involved in getting rights\nShe initially claimed I also witness efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls become an even read it in disoriented so they can then be gang raped in assigned room or a bedroom my train of numerous boys I have a firm recollection of seeing boy you lined up outside the rooms and many of these parties waiting for the return\nWas grew inside the room these boys included more judging Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nLast night on NBC News she said well they didn't stand in line but they huddled my doors and she didn't understand what are you can possibly me she said that she had no idea what the boys were doing outside the door is until she claimed she was raped and then in hindsight claimed it was just too coincidental\nThere's of course comes in well her credibility comes into question after these reports concerning multiple unsubstantiated sexual misconduct claims by the way your boyfriend just couple of days ago her ex boyfriend ... Richard minutes he\nSaid when they broke up she threatened him and his family he even had to file restraining order against her quote right after I broke up with her she was threatening my family threatening my wife and threatening to do harm to my maybe at that time minutes he told Politico I Know a lot about her she's not credible and all he says\nShow her story seem to be coming apart it's amazing what a little I'm willing to and I can do for you huh imagine if you you did it under oath I Wonder if the FBI is going to interview her\nI guess we'll see what comes out here by between now and friday was go to Mike who's been patiently holding in South when it's used in Michael thanks for hanging on well do the voice of Texas\nA thanks for taking my call I think what most people are are\nNot saying here is um you have an opportunity to make a change you have an opportunity to show your stand for and what you believe it out and vote vote early\nAnd or you can show not just here in Texas you have relatives in other states call them talk to them\nAnd uh let them understand how important this election is it's it's just as important as the twenty six election I think that uh come came out he said what he was going to do and he's done it you know look at the economy and look at the way that the country is going I Lived at the security\nThere are a lot of people that hate President Trump basically because\nAre people that are diurnal Democrats dying or Republicans and they have the other opponents um parties you know candidate but in reality there are millions of Americans\nThat are involved in politics and they really don't care too much about that what they care about it they care about national security they care about jobs which are about your family care about making less money out of their pocket\nAnd able to support their family and do what they want with their money\nSo that I cried at least I get off the fans\nGet off your brought it out there talk to your family members get out there and vote because I truly believe what they're doing for this man is\nIt's character assassination and at any cost\nYou know they did it in the election with Obama and Romney Harry Reid came out and said you know it they just taxes in years after the election I asked and he said I don't care\nOne way that's all the matter is that the added to the Democratic party right now that that is the attitude toward anyone that poses a story you any cost to get what we want I Hope\nThat Kavanaugh\nWill be appointed there'll be I Hope that the Senate has enough\nGuts to get out and vote as I'm Talking about the Democrat or I'm Sorry the Republicans and maybe a few Democrats that are hoping that their job will not be taken from it like for instance mentioned in West Virginia and a few other states\nI Will not be taken from like for instance mentioned in West Virginia you other states where if they do wrong way I Hope people will be states come out mass massacre then in the polls\nAnd on election day so how you doing so well the good\nPoints they give us a call I appreciate it you know [noise] I yeah I agree with you said we need to get educated we need to know what we're looking at the Democrats have told us what they're going to do they said they're going to impeach trouble if they get they take control the\nThere's no reason why they can reach them they don't care they hate him that's what they want to teach them and they also want to obstruct anything he's doing\nThey have what he's doing music being effective and he's doing everything he said he was going to do\nReality is I don't want to be somebody over the head of politics but I Do want them to educate themselves look at this looking logic and look what's going on I think they're firing up the base and the firing up a well\nDefinitely Republicans and those who may not be as politically\nBills and some people say I'm On the line as well you guys hang on [noise]
