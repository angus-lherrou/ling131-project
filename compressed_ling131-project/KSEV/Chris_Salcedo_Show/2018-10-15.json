last night was released on sixty minutes and a variety magazine\nAh went through and said despite the fact that he was on there um you know they kinda went after we saw first lady Melania Trump on twenty twenty which there was kind of a blitz on that they tried to get her and early drawer you can't do that with Trump\nAnd like Loni is Trump or millennia Trump's early on message relentless for moving to the interview president interview had effectively the same impact almost as a rallying says\nUh here there are there to buy it allowed him to bulldoze his chief enemy the media while airing his own points at the St Louis linked\nMolested in the media has evidently not learned you have to be sitting right there when he does it in other words so even sixty minutes can't contain him will go back I was playing we we just did the first part where they're supposedly he was making fun of\nA miss you know a block before and he said he wasn't and then he said well you know that's what she said and they of course he continues skied listening oh\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post or for\nWorse never served in the military to vote on right\nThere [noise] okay true and never served in the military truly never held a political post before did they asked President Obama the first president who didn't serve in the military at All right well see the first one\nNot wants none whatsoever in fact he didn't even go to the military type school like what Trump went to when he was young did did they ever know they didn't but nonetheless who cares that ...\nBeen here for almost ... what is that they can buy and what have you learned since you've been\nPresident okay so I always used to say the toughest being one of them that rose and guys about [noise]\nNow he's saying that maybe they only this is the most destructive in his world\nIt is a vicious it's full of lies deceit and is that they make a deal with somebody who's like making a deal with that that table getting ... want to give you an example not looking\nMany example it'd be something I can use Shaq and tried to take your dad even very there I'm\nNobody's been able to do what had been able to\nWhen you look how long does that mean turns around are no one's been able to do what I did okay if you look at that just look at\nIt acts as you look at regulation you look at making deals with other countries nobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people don't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive what the other thing I really learned [noise]\nIt's I never knew how to honestly I I I really mean I'm not saying that as it sounds like a ... and we'll have the eyes were\nNot going to change the subject to get now we don't want to hold on I should question now that you're giving me the answer that will allow you to go back and expand on what we all know now to be quote fake news or the blatant dishonesty of the media no and I would change the question I Want change where we're not going to keep talking we don't talk about this anymore\nEven though when you ask me questions about separation when I did it you don't want to talk about how I feel like it was like and I got an answer for that I'm just telling you that you've seen in any much differently on the subject I I don't want to ask\nI disagree but listen how that high hey hey not if I had okay than I Am president and you're not [laughter]\nI don't have that fight with you why is that we know they cover him in Ninety two percent negative where they covered rock Obama in eighty one percent positive it is literally nine days away they cover the tail\nIt's a one eighty from what they did before he points that out now all of a sudden old and we do I want to have that fight with you want to move on talking about something different\nOkay we can't we only want to talk about what we can do to try and help diminished shoe demean you try to break you down a little bit\nThe funny part is in the audio that I've got there this is a clip from my pull this off YouTube you'll find it starts with an interview Leslie stall saying what do you think about it is actually fairly complimentary towards the press that compared to other people which will get into that here a little later on the program so now we're coming up on another break\nIf you want to join his ear on the boys from Texas to anyone five five eight K. F. C. D. to read one five five eight five seven three eight the article\nThat I'm not going to pledge on sixty minutes I don't want to watch that let's deal with like blanche I've led up to see but I have no intention of that\nHe has no intention of pledging he just answered the question she asked and of course as president he shouldn't have what are we came out in ... new or is involved in in a scam trying to bring down the ... the United states of course he should be fired\nAnd once again they're trying to pigeon hole him on something that they can use to try to detract demean destroy him\nHe's too smart for them he's smarter than they are and they they really can't stand it but I have to admit I was actually very complimentary in her own media why people are saying\nHe didn't like that one either but you know something\nWho who enjoy this fine\nSaid no and I could tell hands right I I I ... I don't want to have that fight\nWith you know hey I got another fight with them as I'm president landed on life\nIn the meantime I'm president and you're not in presidential\nPowers are he was very restrained with you of\nAll why aren't you a question I got my share of fake news I gotta I wouldn't trade it was restrained\nHitler came at ... quite a few times he was proud that this administration\nBecause you guys are big news alone with the time I'm Sorry\nAnd it's like a floating running machine and yet we keep hearing that the White House\nIs in chaos for how many times did you hear the White House was chaos when bronco bomber was changing players within his ... oh that's right they didn't cover that he didn't he didn't have time they were too busy fawning over\nHim and so forth is fake news there was a point where\nHe was being so complimentary illegal cues from the south and got you out for things I\nThink it's so then we got from my first combat ... were injured but now he's Tuesday student has huge compliment to try to soften me\nHow much sixteen is great you know my first interview with Mike Wallace right right and it was such a great interview was she was only nice to me he wasn't as other people many years ago here I Am again sixty minutes with\nLeslie so even bigger than like well that's a huge out here you know when you interview anybody you know what to performance you're on camera the lights are on you know I have very aware of that being a performer you really think I called Russia to help me with an election give me a break and\nI Love that line do you think I'd go Richard help of like give me a break\nSo I think he's always conscious\nThat this has got to be seen by everybody was how am I interviewed her\nSo she's your point is pointing out the obvious I guess I got to fill time and\nSo yeah we're trying to set up a good a chemistry between sometimes\nI think the President Trump decided on\nAn interview with you now at this particular time\nI think he's trying to win the mid term election for the Republicans\nAnd I think civil you and I know these people believe the markings out their publicly\nOn this are the chances are for the Republican\nThat is the best point she makes in the entire interview of everything she said that his dad on because when he goes out and campaigns they generally when and actually right\nAnd I think the White House has come to believe that that I think to try to restrain him to come off televisions put them away from these rallies\nReally to get a lot of energy from crowds\nAnd I think you get a lot of energy wrestling the way he did with me on that because I mean I thought I like doing this I don't know why [noise]\nFortunately was it like a fallen box wrestling match or anything and have been different\nUh once again it literally was fairly complimentary towards him not necessarily during the event but talking about is\nAh so but I thought the president did what he does he is not pay super articulate individual he doesn't he's not the great communicator money sure knows how to talk to his people he knows how to talk to his supporters\nAnd no matter how hard you try to throw them off no matter what they do the ... the best thing about Donald Trump I guess when he does\nIs when they come in him and they're trying to trap 'em in and triple he he sees it he picks up on it and he throws it right back at him and by doing that he's enabled the rest of his supporters to see it as well\nThose on the left to hate him and there was never Trump or to hate him no matter what he does what he says they are going to hate him but Democrats are on the between the Republicans are over on the Senate Judiciary committee when they were going to win Blass before it was going to come testify\nThey what did they say the Democrats and who do this you got twelve year old white man ganging up and just checking this woman\nSo the Republicans going well okay that would surely bad so let's we hire will hired as a prosecutor this one who specializes in sexual assault and does this who can actually handle it and do this in a very kind of way so we can be as respectful and not come off poorly and one of the Democrats say\nLook at these two wells old white man hiding behind this woman\nIn other words Donald Trump does is too you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't no matter what he says they're going to try twisted and destroy him with it whatever he does they're gonna twisted and destroy him with it when he tried to talk about the economy doing well she didn't want to hear any of that that's only going to help them in the midterms\nShe does not want to talk about that we only you know I get it is their job as a reporter you're supposed to tackle tough issues\nBut you ask them direct questions he answered them it didn't turn around and talked about how he didn't want to answer them answer them directly in right away the problem is he thinks so much faster than them he's like a bumble bee buzzing around their heads and they can't\n... you should lose you ever get around somebody who is speaking and I'd bad about this I Apologize I talked too fast\nAnd I have not that I'm smart as President Trump but I think fast and I talk faster to force myself to learn to slow down because when you talk fast it's difficult for some people to keep up a special even trying to do it in the media setting or on the radio\nBut he is like a bumble bee buzzing around them the answers your question and then he's expanding it bought it and by the time they register that he's answered the question they asked me three or four more other times\nHe answers it initially and moves on each going around pointing out other stuff and by doing is he's enabled or his his target audience his supporters and it's clear at this point of view ever looked at the rallies remember\nAudience his supporters and it's clear at this point of view ever looked at the rallies remember during that last election when that clown sort of you look at the rally she's convinced himself he's gonna win ladies and gentleman he's got more rallies going on\nI mean we can always take step back and remember they said you know what's going to happen there was no way he was going to win it just it just you can't know that I Will take a listen to this woman gets like a break\nTake tomorrow night I think my email or a Clinton when that Donald Trump will have lost that selection\nFront of them are very they had already made up their mind and took off after Mexicans\nAre the ... I think you have to debate is Donald house 'cause that's just reach you really can't when he had\nNo chance and my cousin was wrong and we and the numbers are in a manner that out\nTomorrow so I Can't find the same old\nDo in the general election with only twenty five\nHow can they Heinz and expect to win a general you just\nHave to offer difficult to make it really is if there's more cheaply when Trump's negative to remain in the sixties or which is just all really impressive\nWe may lose by his or her own account when where he's like well I don't know I think for themselves to looking at his crowds of the rallies on the size of the things I had\nNo chance to win ... doing when he was doing and with the Latino community feeling so target had from the very first day he announced this guy isn't camping quite wrong\nAnd what happened was they were wrong or their father running down the same same narrative this time is that where they're headed that they're going to continue to do is say well he's ... himself with all these crowds or the last time he had those crowds he won and they didn't know what they thought there was no way he was going to win no chance\nNo chance whatsoever\nBut he did when he did win blanche\nAnd the rest of them are sitting there trying to figure this out now you notice they're not really covering those rallies they covered one negative thing well France had to cover something he did which what he said was true about or not remembering when and where the salt shall we had one beer I remember that\nBut he put a lot of things we're doing here and talk radio he pointed out he was talking to people he also made people realize this woman can't remember anything but she knows exactly who what did win wear a wire now [noise]\nThe problem is the people in this country you have learned the media is disingenuous there really are\nThey don't care whether Trump in fact they would prefer that he does not succeed they donated Ninety plus percent to the Democratic party they don't want him winning they don't want him wanting the midterms they want to do everything they can to stop it held there there are so desperate they're giving Alec Baldwin his own talk show he's got his own talk show now [noise]\nYou want to make and how we would hate Trump All right let's take a break you listening to the boys have\n... seven hundred KFC I Am ...

U. C. V. to a one size five eight five seven three age than the last segment we were talking about a biological my own my dental classes a transgender woman\nWho's got news is not the only one but this is just another case of a guy who when I had I think he had the surgery I don't know I looked at the picture was not really sure because the dude none of the lessons of duty wants to be a woman and now has one and women's world championships cycling of that\nYesterday Rachel McKinnon professor at the College of Charleston one of the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine age brackets at the twenty Eighteen UCI masters truck them sorry masters track cycling world championship in LA\nAnd it's funny because the Democrats are always the one thing the Republicans are waging a war\nOn women but it seems like Jim ... the only ones won't allow men to per ... performance sports with women and beat up on them we've got at least a couple of high school\nBoys that decided they were girls even though they haven't had the surgery yet they went on and they're beating these high school girls that track and field we got Fallon Fox whose literally beating women broken at least Hoover contestants or rules in a mixed martial arts because Alan Fox was it\nWas the dude and had transgender surgery and Vietnam and now you've got this Rachel McKinnon guy girl\nProfessor college in Charleston and what's funny is I Know I Know there's some people listening I'd probably very few of them to the host of taxes are going to ... she was such a hater you were such a hater\nSettled down their Adolf Hitler\nI'm not a hater I don't hate people I don't care well I'm afraid that don't have normal people and ... ... ... ... if you have sex change I don't I have no problem with that if you're gay if you're trends\nIf you're ... I don't care that is your business I think we live in a free country and that is your business if that's how you choose to live your life You're welcome do it here\nBut when you start doing things that affect other people's lives well that changes it what about these other two contestants these these other two women that are actual woman that lost now one of them would have actually won\nBut now she's a second place behind the man who's got an unfair genetic advantage in these sorts of sports track and field mixed martial arts cycling weightlifting competition wrestling\nThere was another case when this was once again these left these it shows there there\nThere are there in saying it's just in pain\nBecause they want us to believe one and this person is now a woman into is now\nOver this woman living her life but she does this man one of his life as a woman or whatever I'm all for this but I'm not for you going in and competing in and basically altering the playbook you're now making getting more of these these women in there\nYou're not playing in a fair playing field anymore it's not fair\nThese lessons to claim to be all about fairness or completely wrong on this and the point I was going to make was there was a woman who wants to be a dude she's taking testosterone injections to do she's a high school wrestler\nSo she gets to compete with women in other words she's cheating she's taking steroids they allow her to do it if another woman said just the girls would listen I'm a woman and I want to be a girl I Want to be female but I Want to take testosterone the same exact knows the Jews that this\nWoman is doing the claim to be transgender so I could be that would be illegal what is fair about that they won't let them do it but they'll let\nYou people have thought your cells into a corner it's it's a bunch of over educated under intellectuals and now they're making decisions they controlled academia in this country for very long time and here we are now now they're going to take over sports or whatever else they can get their hands on\nIn other words the has the exact number Native American than you are right or any other white American or black American or really probably any American unless they happen to actually have Native American in them than they actually are\nMore Native American them we moved up speaking of so God it's now we've got so women and we've been talking about this trend I Know trends is if you go to Google and you watch TV and all these left wing organizations they are pushing trends so hard they have children so confused now\nChildren don't know what's a man and wants a boy and what the girl you got a party\nThat literally says you can't consider [noise] [noise]\nI'm trying to I don't want to I'm afraid to get myself in trouble you have a party that has no problem with the biological male claiming to be transgender in a women's restroom okay\nNow the very same party is also the same on this claimed Kavanaugh showed his member at a college party and so now that the end of the world's but you'd think you guys and left me totally fine was a full grown man claiming to be trends\nExposing himself in front of your six seven year old daughter and the ... you want to know why you're sided so messed up so that's why\nI Know there are people that can for whatever reason they consider themselves transgender I have no problem with you living as a transgender person if you want me to call you a woman I Will call you a woman if you're respectful to me and you're a good person\nI'll call you whatever you call your Pocahontas call you or whatever but if you were jerks that's different\nWe have this biological males who identifies as a transgender woman competing in a women's world champions of cycling event on Sunday and beating out the women\nIt was a twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championships in Los Angeles not only did they win then McCain and went on to talk about well earlier and after about having these trends men compete in these\nCan be these events with women and then compared it to slavery by catering to this gender people's views and that's their term to try to to ... you guys that are straight and not trends are not gay you since gender now they're not just oh you're not just straight or whatever it is gender\nTo buy catering to assist in people's views that further transgender people's oppression\nWhen it comes to his standing rights to minority population why would we asked the majority\nSome clearly you're not for democracy at all you want what you want when you want it you want it and that's all that matters and screw everyone else I bet a lot of white people were pissed off when the desegregated sports a racially allow blind people to compete they had to deal with it\nYeah there were racist that were upset by that I was not I have no problem with African American men competing with any other ethnicity of male\nOr women competing with women I don't care what your gender is I'm Sorry [noise]\nYour race and it's it's hard to keep up everybody's press now\nWhat about women are they being oppressed by men pretending to be women or men who have maybe even gender this floria who now seeing their women or maybe just do the lying claiming their women\nTo a one size of a case the to lead one five five eight five seven three eight let's go to for instance go who's been patiently holding things where I get on Francisco welcome to the voice of Texas\nThough you're right you know what it is not fair to the woman there's no way there's no breaking way okay not that aside at your last caller than he stole my thunder have anything I I'm definitely an opportunity to\nYou know like what is the first thing in any if you've got to get the people in right now we got the idea of a new mom I think that they didn't do anything to get the people and\nSo if you look at regular special right get the oil in why ... ... to get it in a row in whatever in the I'm an opportunity if\nI'm at work for for instance ... I'm going to be listening for the commercials on guard it's mark [laughter] you're [laughter] right [laughter] I've\nOriginated there you have at least that's any it makes a good point he's right this is America land of the free so yeah absolutely that's come up with some our own trans sporting events were trends men can be with trains man and trans women can be a trans ... it's really not fair\nAnd here's another problem I have with us when it comes to become collegiate athletics or high school you got dude you got a couple of these African American men that were very mediocre\nTrack and field stars were very fast guys way faster than I ever was\nBut there are fast but not not good enough they can't really compete on the male level well they moved over to become trends or high school students and then they when they're breaking the women's records even though they haven't transition they just cleaned the trans now\nSoldiers screwing up the documentation which clearly is not going to matter to a lefty book is documentation doesn't matter to people they don't care about what your DNA has\nThey don't care they don't care about what the constitution says they'll rewrite it they don't know what was the definition of a baby is foreign born\nSomehow miraculously just do it just turns into a baby nine months and bumps out but if you can get to it before that it simply accomplished cells [noise]\nThis is where we are in twenty Eighteen who would've thought at this point the left who claims to be tolerant and progressive or now preaching incivility at all costs until they're back in power and they were completely regress\nAnd with all of their views they don't even understand why women and men competed different it's it's just very strange to me to anyone by five eight teams to me let's go to John listening on the west side John thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice from Texas\n[laughter] on behind the New York city for a cabinet issue\nThat they did what did they do well where are those shows he was mayor of New York city didn't fare when a child is\nBorn that there is a third category that that the hospital all you know on the on the record\nYeah now female white [noise]\nYeah they can just put the axe murderer either or whatever [noise] so what does it let me get a little here's my question so what is this so later on down the road when the kid is old enough to take the kid can determine what gender they are\nA show you don't have these issues about a male female it's so it's already a documented or Twenty years\nOr um\nAnd it uh Twenty years were\nYou know we should or New York city and a lot has really honestly like I shouldn't laugh at one or two which is set to shut out\nThe window and fight among themselves\nAnd towards that one okay\nYes I and I think for the call John appreciate it hey you know the thing is my only problem was that was once again is now we're going to have all of these quote you know these these records with collegiate are professional or high school sports that are all going to be skewed because you get new sitting all these records and and yet the here's the thing\nThere there's there's obviously there's multiple lines of thinking on that [noise]\nI don't like allowing something that I Know it was going to be a problem of actually going to become a problem in life I'm utterly trying to make sure that I make like veteran easier for me where everybody around me and the goal is to try to offset any problems before they occur you know the old adage an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure right\nWell you don't want to wait for cancer to go through and they treat the cancer now you want to be able to treat it which is a good point to take care of it but that being said you can prevent it it's pretty clear in today's society that if you don't smoke cigarettes you got a much better chance to live longer and healthier life\nIt's pretty clear the average smoker doesn't make it to sixty five\nBut that being said we know there's always different genetic findings involves\nThis is clearly an issue that is it's not fair to women so should we allow this to become a big problem and take care of it when right now we already know just because you've got a bunch of crybaby liberals determined they want to rewrite the rules on everything just so it benefits them and this cloud in New York once again can\nGraduate can you give me a doctor here's the baby congratulations\nYou have a brand new will it will tell us if it's a boy or a girl in five to seven years maybe ten years we don't actually wants to know that one because we believe in gender fluidity and there's I don't know I I lean towards the other one I liked the capitalism you have the transports\nAnd then you can I mean I just thought sure try\nTo see them that I just hate crime because I don't know if I'd had let's take a short break and\nYou're listening to the voice of sexual they've given up occasionally this has predicts radio [noise]\nSay we're going to come back and talk about something a little more common sense when we need to make rapidly show with for North Texas women I think maybe to try and I don't know [noise] members of an organized voter fraud ring right here in Texas where all the very same levees are telling us there is no voter fraud and we need to the gym for oh you have to show
