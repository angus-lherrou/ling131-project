guys on the line we're going to go right to the phones in particular Eric who's hanging in spring branch\nArabic trained on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThat's going to get a question for you I'm basically it is with the uh the fact that we're so there is a Republican that we actually find out to do that um what do you think that was on the a ... term elections as well as um\nHow long do you think the investigation would actually be\nMy lord in this day and age there's absolutely no telling I'll tell you this it it wouldn't it is truly it is a quote you know person on the right where they wouldn't be a Republican because no Republican in the rye might goes round preaching blowing up the opposition they've never done it nobody does it they'll clean Trump does it but he doesn't so there's that\nThey've never done it nobody does it smell clean Trump does it but he doesn't so there's that\nHe would be I think there could be similar fallout and\nHe would be to win that crazy Bernie Sanders supporter went and tried to murder those Republicans practicing baseball cap in Alexandria so I think it would be something similar to those ones which really we saw no not a whole lot of political fallout whatsoever and the fact that no one was hurt\nIt just seems it clearly there's more than one person involved in this and it will be very interesting to see what pans out\nYeah and I just you know and then the Hillary actually a creature we're a bit more about sincerity that 'cause I think it should really ironic [laughter]\nFrom now and do you make a good one they were the caller you had Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters you've got all these other Republicans people like Cory Booker Republicans or Democrats like Cory Booker and Eric Holder and all of them preaching infidelity\nThey're the ones talking about in civility in something like this happens when you go out and you open that door saying listen I disagree with you so we're not going to be civil any longer\nWho leads more to which direction I don't know who did this it's way too early to tell clearly it's more than one person I think it's a group of people and there's ... it wouldn't surprise me one way or the other but I just find it ironic that here right before the midterm you've heard the term October surprise\nFrom everything I'm hearing from will just say from high above things aren't going the way they had planned for the Democrats and they were hoping to wipe everybody out with this election\nI Would put nothing by them I Would put nothing by Maxine Waters who said she wants a group of groups of people to go out and around people that they disagree with and tell them they're not welcome nowhere no house thinking for the call let's go to write listening in ... in the right thing for hanging on welcome to the voice of taxes [noise]\nAppreciate it a real quickly have much instability and um and you mentioned the Democrats who are they preach that nonsense I disagree with that\nThey need to reach up ... billion also\nDidn't you did not mention Donald Trump who who actually promote it encourages violence at his rallies and you add a whole lot of that that was committed by the end of of of of of Republicans and for you to somehow implied that Republicans or long\nPeaceful people never reality as Americans are boundary that none of their race or their skin color\nOr a there are a sex and or their religion I'm that's what it is so don't don't do that ... if you're really going to be honest it to\nBe on your alignment national right did you just admit to being a very violent person who's I think you're an American right\nWell uh in the respect that route say America and I'm inclined to country it so I Would think that not every single one in this nation in the bottom person just like every white man is a clans Lynn but a lot of them might be you know what I mean\nSo thank you so you believe the vast majority of white men are klansmen\nFar from it nor do I get a letter misunderstood that because that was funny you know far from it but you know the idea of of of of of of civility you didn't address though Donald Trump and his rally promoted\nVia let me address that I Will let me address this right now Donald Trump and you're right at a rally were guy was causing problems he said punch that guy in the face he did it and then somebody did it and he immediately went back and condemned what they didn't say don't do what I was speaking\nOut of turn I shouldn't have said that he apologized sports and said don't do this we know for a fact that Democrats sit paid operatives to start fights and cause problems at ... at rallies for Donald Trump so you tell me who is worse\nWell well I mean it was worse ah I don't go to the top of the food chain and the one at a higher level that would be your friend again and again\nAs the president at the time\nYou want you want to dismiss his behavior\nI miss it I told you that he\nHold on right listen I didn't dismissive I told you what he did and what he said and then also I didn't tell you when I didn't want out the way the media packaged it never really played his his apology and say no absolutely don't do that we don't want you to hurt anyone\n'cause that's a man Donald Trump as as as apologized for the behavior of skinheads races\nOr no we had a heated hot it's easy to just how every one of them\nDon't know what do you try to do is offer a comparison to recall them saying to the people who are there acted peacefully but I'm asking a question here because we are back in time um the idea that ... that\nWe need to the to the border on your own business and that's the only thing I support them going on we need to secure the border and every last one of those people who had been this way and then around\nGoing back and maybe in the mail we have to go hungry and it can be made in ... in the house\nAnd clothes who were like oh\nWe're right on so I was on your right where are short on time I'm trying to get to be more\nI'll Try to just more of that later there was a lot of stuff to use it and it was correct but incorrect I'm Glad we found common ground because we're absolutely in agreement on border but that being said there's a whole lot of misinformation that the media did on purpose and it worked because those who tend to disagree with Donald Trump they believed every bit of they still do\nDon't get me wrong Donald Trump's not perfect man and I'll never say was I didn't like it when he said when he said and then he apologized for it and they made a point to act like ... when we know for a fact\nThe Democrat Party was paying people to commit violence and we could do five shows on that\nSplits quickly go to Tony listening in the woodland Tony thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nI called the yes on this stage a bomb event I'm aren't too many of the bombs went on come on give me a break this to the Republican or Democrat so I've been watching them they'd been sitting this narrative for about a month you know\nTalking about how radical the right way years or you know get married in your mind like you have the right way news radical Noor out their tea parties radical they're attacking people now with that and you got this caravan coming in and just killing the Democrats so therefore\nNeeding stretch the people's\nMinds off the air man\nTony you had to ... oh that's a really good point you just made because you're absolutely right you're talking about this caravan and that is not voting for Democrats because there will be open borders one and then all of a sudden here we go with well then now there's bombs being sent there I mean there's no telling you it's way too early to tell but the reality is\nAs you say you and we I was very unique and special and I know you've got to fly it was a tandem flight which is I didn't know what that was I now know thinks the wings or Houston ... there was another like he was on another plane and we basically got up and mirrored each other as a kind of like follow the leader and we were very close which is good for me who doesn't fly very often and I'm not a pilot\nI was scared how close we were and then I realized how good those those pilots really are but Greg got to fly in and Italian uh no no was it ... it was a Spanish plane there was actually from the Spanish Lady from Spain that was incredible\n[laughter] well I'm Glad you enjoyed it how was the end the tandem flying and yet to see that in\nThe whole way anyone gets a chance to do that you want to go check it out it was ... it's a little scary at first because you know I don't I don't fly very often and I'm not a big flood guy you as far as you I've never been a pilot or anything so when you're taking off it's a little unnerving because you're very closely thinking this doesn't seem\nBut then every time we get any and we hit very little wind very little turbulence and the guys were fantastic I saw how they navigate around each other and it was just very close and I got a lot of video and a lot of pictures that I posted on our Facebook page Casey DAM seven hundred the voice of Texas if you want to go check it out from our time over when the Houston\nAnd in the flight was incredible was smooth as as glass when we were up there got fly over the coast a little bit and the friend Hartman bridge and around the uh the the battleship the Texas monument and it was really neat and it's something that you know like I said I've I've never thought I'd have the opportunity to do so I think you guys\nUm robust beyond that I Want to go talk a little bit about some of the events that were taken place you mentioned the blue angels and they were just firing up the engines when we walked by\nTalking about power that is an incredible display\nYeah there's there's nothing like seeing them perform and particularly inside the gates of our show they come as close as they're allowed right over you and around it fits loud and and fun and smiling faces everywhere\nAre talking about tandem those guys fly right on top of each other and do they have\nIt's unbelievable what they do and it's pretty incredible it also knows man those engines in those buildings are incredible uh well the for those of you who are listening on friday the amigos broadcasting live from the Lone Star flight museum and why we're there while they were finishing up broadcasting\nI Know there was a dinner and we get to see all the pilots from the blue angels the walking him to go have their dinner and we get to see that I was the Lone Star flying museum\nIf I'm correct It's only been over that location over for what the last couple of years or so\nNow it's actually then exactly a year and Hurricane Harvey actually\nSlowed down there and opening so yeah I'm a ... year year and a month\nThen that's incredible we're talking with an attached to a being a she's with wings over Houston assistant executive director um we I didn't realize it only been a year that's that's amazing because he was formerly in Galveston but it moved over to Ellington I guess was it a Hurricane Harvey that really would cause and it was it already and process now and there\nWas actually hurt the night you did it and\nThey they had been working on getting into this from Galveston at Ellington and then we work so closely with on the show with them and they said beautiful facility if you haven't seen it you really should get out there it's it's amazing that got simulators and the fact that they should museum and it's it's a nice way to spend the day\nYeah really is the the simulators are cool\nThe of not only that and probably my favorite part I guess it shows what a nerd I Am was I guess there's a couple of hangers on the back side with all the different types of planes in them and I guess because you can go take pictures and and all of that that is incredible and you mentioned there's also the the simulator there's also like a against the door so you can go buy\n'em train gets in shirts and hats and whatever you want there\nThe facility you mentioned it sells his brand new it is beautiful and I like I said I had no idea was that nice so being able to go there and then of course the illegals broadcasting\nI also would be remiss if we don't talk about the heroes and the legends who were out of the nose of the big ugly that'd be fifty to straddle fortress knew there was a pretty good turnout to go up people to go hang out with the heroes and legends\nOh yeah they have a great turnout and we're we're very fortunate where one of the army air show in the country that that and have the opportunity to her that many at war heroes and and now after nine states it's a great day and there there was always a line coming out of that every time I was five thousand dollars\nYou imagine I got last week I got the interview George Abby in a very pompous in Joe MacPhail all those guys were

I could have talked to those guys forever so I can imagine there's a whole lot of people that went over there and just were able to take in the history that those guys offer and they're doing it right in front of a B. fifty twos ... which is pretty amazing\nYeah it's it's a great opportunity and living history you know and that's that's a great added feature to our show I mean to have these these men and women show up in and tell their stories and in front of airplanes that they've flown throughout their life it's it's very special and we're very fortunate to have them you\nKnow it was pretty neat I'm looking forward to next year's already wings overused and it's going to be a need deal and getting to talk with those guys I Know there's a case to me it's been a partner for some time with wings over Houston and we're going to continue to do that and I'm already looking forward to next year hopefully we'll get perfect weather on both days this time I Know normally you guys get really good weather for both days\nYeah we deal with that a couple of years with like minded that storming in twenty Seventeen flip through and we were able to get everybody up in the air and Sam third time's a charm and hopefully hopefully it's perfect Lenin\nAnd absolutely won't attach ab thank you so much for joining us this afternoon I wanted to give everybody a recap and talk a little bit about my fly to brag a little bit because I get to fly one of the coolest planes ever with some of the coolest guys ever and I really appreciate your time today and you guys letting us do that that was a lot of fun\nI have that thank you thank you to everyone who came out to the\nLabs are literally I appreciate that once again the Tasha Avi assistant executive director wins over Houston there'll be doing it again extra you missed out you really need to go check it out [noise]\nDo we need to get an extra you missed out you really need to go check it out [noise]\nDo the thing I think we always forget just how strong and powerful those planes those engines are\nOne of those blue angels were just they just they were just sitting I didn't get seems law I missed him you know they're not ... we got to go check everything else in them because the ceiling drop they weren't practicing\nSo I didn't get to see him dry I heard those engines as they were just more minimum\nYou guys don't forget wings of next year we're partners with them and we will continue to be so only thing that's actually a before coming out and joining us\nForce everybody get what you had to talk about a needed that Sunday was beautiful let's take a short break you're listening to the voice of Texas name seven hundred cases ... radio on the X. men we're going to come back and talk about those potential explosive devices that we're sitting in the homes of\nHillary Clinton their colder wrong mama in Washington shoals and more if you want to join us and we in doing one ... one five five eighty five seven three\nYour mommy were recruited my native six I'm a voice from Texas\nHello this is ... author of a best\nSelling book cancer step outside the box for how long you know some very important information in Nineteen eighty five president Ronald Reagan requested a carnival or be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could have pain this world class he kind of more capsules or use around the world to keep people healthy now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in\nThis age of superbugs would Seventeen naturally occurring compounds betting fainted we respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal scale\nIf you want to stay healthy now is your chance to literally wake up you're critical immune cells\nTo attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body one eight six six Venus fly\nTo order from carnival dot com that we are in I.

Red Bluff that's on the right shoulder the other one of the rights showed her on the grand part way west that's going to be south latitude nutty for watching it on the shoulder of the hardy till real south out of debt will\nDisabled Eighteen wheeler causing problems that's walking to write laying on the east ... and if you're driving home I Do not even west\nNow from six ten out there tell me that's going to take you just over thirty minutes that as you look at traffic now back to more critics radio right here on AM seven hundred KFC me the voice of Texas [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to her sexual radio here on AM seven hundred and ... being the voice of Texas what have you guys with us as we keep rolling through the wee hours of the afternoon drive your in your for your money with Rick Freeman coming up just a bit later she can stick around for that we're talking about the secret service intercepting the suspected packages\nIdentified as potential explosive devices since before President Obama secretary of State Hillary Clinton colder Debbie Wasserman Schultz Maxine Waters George Soros got one yesterday they're saying they were hand delivered even CNN in New York had a bomb scare earlier today\nThey're saying they looked like crude pipe bombs were getting very little information right now looks like they were hand delivered a multiple states so clearly there's more than one person involved\nIt's going to be very interesting to see how this pans out president has already come out and condemned it on all sides and will use every facet of the U.S government to track down who did this to stop them and prosecute them\nTo the fullest extent of la Hillary Clinton has already come out and so she's going to get that guy who did that video the cars that attack in Benghazi a wage\nThat was in two thousand twelve\nSeptember the eleventh\nAnd that guy had nothing to do with it it was a terrorist attack and all of these Democrats who are calling this terrorist attack none of them wanted to call that a terrorist attack even though they knew it was at the time\nI'm just just pointing out facts ladies and gentlemen it's what I Do too many won five five eight ... if you want to join us\nTo read one five five eight to five seven three ate what do you think who do you think is behind this it's too early to really come to any conclusions but\nI'm not going to go Alex Jones gay frogs on you or anything but sometimes when suddenly smells like a rat it could be just a rat ... razor does apply often two one five five eight K. C. V. let's go to mark ... holding in northwest Houston mark thank you for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nNow to Chris ... either got to be the Russians are dropped the product can figure that but yeah it\nSeems all folk when there are all only in my my worry grabs\nIt all of those people on an even rent side I I don't understand that there's plenty of other people if someone was going on in\nThe ... own either party and do the same thing but it was in the south and now this\nAnd we've got you know it germs coming up next week you know some it's done the right and maybe that's a new chapter of the eating red light book but I I don't think that something is behind\nIt is it right in and not someone on but they didn't ... really are they just somebody calls this the am I don't know but uh it's not funny and it's not impossible used either detonate them or I mean if they could harm someone this obviously and find out\nWhether or not I don't think Frank but\nNobody's trying to send somebody as serious and that's it but you know it's a little more than getting yelled at in a restaurant that's for sure\nBut you're absolutely right I think for the call mark and you're right it to me first of all these are actual explosive devices\nFirst of all none of them would often no one was hurt great I'm Glad to hear that I'm Glad to hear as much as I just buy some of these people I don't want them being killed\nBy bombs with our country remembers the Democrats are the ones who prefer bombs you know the ... and burning door no sort you know the weather underground people they're the ones using bombs and killing people in the past so that there's that\nThat being said we don't know\nDidn't bombs and killing people in the past so that there's that that being said we don't know these are legit bombs or not we will hear sounds like they are from all accounts so far I don't know still very early nonetheless I don't want anyone getting hurt or killed by a bomb you never want to condone that kind of behavior\nIs awfully interesting that all of these people were targeted and you mentioned the midterms coming up next week the midterms are underway early voting is taking place now as we speak so they're underway you mentioned the caravan which we'll talk about that and the we got one of the migrants admitting that they are criminals everywhere in the um the caravan\nWho will get to that but certainly this giant blue wave that we're supposed to be coming it doesn't look like it's transpiring in fact it looks like it's perspiring in other words going away\nIt's dying on the vine from what it looks like with early voting numbers death a bad sign for Democrats historically bad really really bad for them\nAnd then you get huge care of and there was one now there's two of them will now we're hearing a third caravans for me so we can always do and that that's not playing well with the Democrats we've got ...\nAnd then here all of a sudden after the second day of early voting here comes all these bombs sent to a certain set of people that someone can be trying to go any Hillary Clinton as a press conference and basically says this is a terrorist act\nAnd you need to vote for Democrats basically that is what she said paraphrasing protest what she said\nThese are the same people that refused to call it the terrorist attacks when they found a car full of explosives in times square in New York City [noise] they ... they prevented the terrorist attack from happening\nThey prevented hits but they would not call it a terrorist attack Hillary Clinton is now saying this is a terrorist attack because it\nJust clearly some sort of terrorism looks like it to me if you're sending bombs the people that is a terrorist act who's sending them I don't know whoever we find out shouldn't be prosecuted and this would be an act of terrorism in these are actual explosive devices than absolutely\nThank you for the call appreciate it to a one size I Can't see me to a one size five eight five seven three eight let's begin with Willie in the medical center Willie thinking we're hanging on will do with the voice of taxes\nThank you for receiving my call I got a state and uh and then I Want to give ... my assessment on what this is about um one of the things I've always did I'm a veteran and I've served during the Vietnam um arrow conflate\nI'm and I'm proud that I'd be but I also want to say I always told my children and they're all from Joe people today\nNumber one don't react to the first thing you hear a stretch of the day don't don't believe the first thing you hear so this is\nMy opinion it's just a smokescreen for smoking screens\nBecause number one first of all not one of the um if I was like nothing nothing happened not war not even accidentally number to the fact of the matter is that it's it's all happening\nAgain right at the invasion of uh immigrants coming into our country and then there is the all of us and the threat of some explosive going about none of that stuff is all smoke screen and they are the people of fear\nAnd they're trying to put fear into people change to sway people's my out of voting simply put simply put I mean if this is the biggest got to be the biggest most great I've ever free\nWilly first of all I think you really call thank you for your service and great points you write in this day and age you can't believe the first thing you hear from the media at this point\nThey're ... they're almost never ride anymore and I know what there's a rush to beat social media do whatever but more often than not nowadays to do what comes out of school facts in the beginning tend to be not facts at all and then we get alternative facts that\nDidn't go back what you just said not one of those devices were detonated so no one was hurt thank God I'm Glad to hear that and sort of all the point you're making\nThe timing is just really suspect on this way and once again it's ... it's just today\nWe have no idea who said that she had when we do have histories gauge and we could go back and there's there are certain people that have reputation that proceeding themselves which lead us to go with ... surprise me\nAnd you'll notice I made no decisions on who I think it is\nLate some things on the table but we just don't know and that's a great point and thanks again for your service I think you've nailed this could be nothing but smoke and mirrors an attempt to watch convince people to load a certain way we know nothing is above certain politicians they will do anything they can\nIncluding manipulating other people in their lives in foreign countries to make them travel thousands and thousands of miles and try to get here only to be turned away\nOr to try to get them here and utilize them as their votes so uh there's there's a lot going on I think you're really come to any one firefighter Casey me let's go to Jay listening in Jersey village thanks for hanging on Jay welcome to the voice of Texas\nThanks yeah what you say is to get people to vote a certain way it could also be to have the opposite effect to actually make it look fishy so people on the other side that don't agree with those people go out and vote and I would say if you look back\nSo do you saw it have you been in several here [noise] unlike Hillary Clinton news that\nYou can't be suitable until\nThey're back in power you know what I still want to be civil even last caller Jay appreciate go you know it's a great things we can disagree and and I know it's difficult to listen to an entire show so we can disagree and I don't wish any ill will harbor any horrible thoughts towards them I Hope we lived in water will happen to live and I even obey goes back\nI was just having a tough time following and who's got a bouncing around a little bit\nBut nonetheless we preach civility you're on the program welcome back to ... radio you're on the boys from Texas and seven hundred Casey me where to go right back to the phones to anyone five five eight ... as the the if you want to join us to a one five five eight five seven three we're talking about these\nPotential explosive devices they're saying at least one of them was operational none of them were detonated there were sent to Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters Morocco mama I'm ... I'm there must be ... George Soros yesterday or colder Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nShow all of these bombs\nAnyway interestingly enough during the break I was reading an article from CNN talking about\nWell talking about civility in unity the President's Day called for unity in his remarks saying we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message to threats or acts of political violence have no place in the United states of America\nDisagree just conducted the boards to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans we're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we witness this morning and we will get to the bottom audit\nHis remarks were greeted with a standing ovation in the room that sounds like a pretty unifying message from the president that I got from CNN and politics oh I left out the first one\nCNN\nSaid the president who was recently taken the goal and his political opponents evil\nYou want to know why there's a lack of civility you got people like\nMr Costa Jim Acosta CNN on the president calls himself a nationalist he loves his country he says you mean white nationalist right inserting race everywhere that's what they do it's how they do it\nYeah remember you're not allowed to pay attention to that you need to pay attention to what they're saying let's go to the phones to eat one plus I have a case to be Sandy holding in South Houston Sandy thank you for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHi Chris how are you I'm good how are you today than it\nIs you know ... a kind of radical he won at the end of the things they do it's all black member that\nThat would I think I I Can't remember the name of the Republican president that he had some other people like ... and they walk media and they got pictures of\nThe KKK rooting for this and that we had to think so it's a lot of the headlines and can't afford it and I I you know now I mean the thing with the explosive in and I\nCan't help thinking again what eight brainwashed in college and she and bright yelling at me and I would not apply and it's a false\nNow it it's the non smoking when yeah down here\nAnd you make a good point saying thank you for the call you make a good point because\nYou're writing you know you've got these these ... and that was the Obamas\nAre due course Hillary and those people and you're talking about well false flags or whatever but you're right that is there is something we've seen\nDemocrats were paying agitator Z to go to Trump rallies and start fights so there will be violence to go in and attack people they were paid to do this that was for a reason still in the news can say well there was a Trump rally today and more violence broke out\nYou're absolutely right now it's been done on both sides throughout history we've seen it\nBut in recent times we've seen far more on one side than the other\nWe've seen what's happening with antifa they go to events when they cause problems and then you've got places like Portland with the police won't even do anything they allow these people to run amok through the streets and attack others who thought Trump supporters being attacked\nAnd then when they fight back it it's it's similar to a not a big NFL fan I haven't watched one game this year I'm not going to watch football but in football one of the things you see regularly because you have people you know they'll they're playing in the play and then you'll see that punch your guy the end of a boy he gets the flag thrown at him he gets the penalty\nThe other guy was doing all kinds of moving the head of the time but he stopped at the end of the play to the other guy hits back\nThere is a method to the madness now we don't know what the method to this madness is or where it's coming from but it just looks really suspicious at this point good call thank you very much let's go to James listening and Katie James thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nYou're correct back yard what Donald Trump are just love that guy I'd already Jesus that Jewish governors guy every day for Donald Trump God Bless KGB I I Love this station you can call it people will you and I I can talk to the house\nAnd I must say one thing um I could see why we took a six hour point no divers because those bombs didn't make me most people they're kind of bad people\nAnd I don't wish ill for them but I Do think the justice should be served where do you prefer\nWell they give us a call James a year right whoever did this\nClearly justice needs to be served by grew with everything the president said this goes against every bit of our republic or democracy this we should be upset by this no matter who did it whatever it boils down to get more details and when we do\nWe should come together as one country in the old days I liked it when you know what you disagree with somebody and it's okay we don't have to be buddies and we don't have to be friends and we don't have to hate each other\nWhen we're done and not in power it's okay to let the other side's yo and if they want an election [noise]\nYou don't do say we're gonna follow you around him and and harassed you wouldn't believe him [noise]\nIn any where they go with a restaurant in the building\nMaxine Waters Eric Holder Hillary Clinton's they are preaching this instability\nIn fact this is a response to that\nThe ones calling for it I don't want anyone getting hurt I Want them to be civil\nHow civil they were some rock Obama\nWant everybody to be just assume Donald Trump whether you agree with them or not he's our president\nShould come together as a matter of one side has made it very clear at this point they have no desire to come together\nTheir leader of the resistance Hillary Clinton said we'll be civil\nThat is dangerous territory my\nWant to join
