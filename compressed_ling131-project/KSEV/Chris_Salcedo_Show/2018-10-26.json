Orlando assay and that's a to point race that's bizarre that one of those bizarre and so I have to point up who jumped ah well in the ... in both races the Democrats up by one or a bike too so uh and\nThat's in Florida and then you have all the states that are in play and that you know the Democrats just parachuted in about three million dollars to help out uh in New Jersey a bomb and then ... is in trouble at five point rates are so Menendez the Democrat crooked Democrats center\nA there was accused of bribery uh and then I think it was a hung up on our group a quid acquitted okay I Am running for re frying yeah yeah they might be I don't know a way that they're it's within five points so Democrats are scrambling\nAh in New Jersey and tried to hold on to that seat in Indiana where the Democrat Joe Donnelly\nI was ... he was leading in every poll or against the Republican I think he might be the secretary state or a G ... last name as Braun Braun is now ahead by four point and that shifted\nWell you know from that you know pre cabinet opposed capital in Montana where the incumbent Democrat as Jon Tester Bob to again but tester he's got a three point lead over the Republican uh which is down from nine or so\nThat was surprising leader if you think about it well we'll see what happens you know he's been around a long time on Trump hates them I mean he he was out there actually have\nA what is tested catcher blocked the eye doctor at the White House from becoming\nThe head and wealthy wouldn't ... allies about that yeah remember what he did and then I'm just looking here for a Arizona in Missouri Hi there go okay in in in a North Dakota we know Heidi Heitkamp\nIncumbent Democrat I think she's toast you can't win I don't think she could have Democrats pulled they're having a ... she's down close to double digit low key but in West Virginia looks like Joe mansions can pull it out\nSo because he voted for capital what about Missouri a and in Missouri\nAre limited outlook that's Claire McCaskill's a seat I'm looking for the latest poll a let me just check it real quick um I think it's the last time I saw the humidity even I mean it was a virtually even last time I looked\nA looking at this poll and it is right now uh the Republican is up by half a point that even at that that's amazing really\n... become a quite a red state though right so I can see Republicans picking up you know three four seats uh you know we'll see what ...\nSo I can see Republicans picking up you know three four seats or you know we'll see what happens in Florida in the Senate the house\nI don't know I still think you know I predicted this in January of last year that the Republicans pick up seats in the Senate and that the Democrats win the house I'm I they're not going to go you're not going to be a blue way and there's not going to be a landslide opened the Democrat the house races or on blue turf\nAnd they have a lot of these a couple of advantages like in Pennsylvania they are going to pick up a couple of seats because the Democrat controlled legislature and you've got Democrats Supreme Court\nDecided they were going to re grow the congressional districts yesterday that exercise and actors are spoiled and you've got forty eight house members that are retiring this year and only a Democrat house members retiring and of course you know their party had a power user picked up seats so they only need twenty three\nI think they'll probably get there but as I said Nancy Pelosi is not going to be the speaker when Congress convenes\nWho are they going to get instead the number one candidate is of course she jak do one person\nThat represents all their values and that Sheila Jackson Lee All right so let's go to the ... Congress ... great for me there you know certainly you can get you get your political large and I didn't get good at the trial I can get a passionate\nI'm like like the ... when I visit a Washington I mean I think Donald Trump would love for her to be speaker no none of it All right bill appreciate your holding thanks for joining us on the voice of Texas go ahead do how do you\nHow you guys doing today very good show as usual ...

school with them and they were like theirs and the thing was that last word here illegally to so when you start opening the doors like that\nUh you're going to have one heck of a problem down the road because you see what they wound up becoming over many many years and the other thing I was listening to talk about\nI just keep thinking ... there was a Democratic president that got us about World War one world war two course interned Japanese Americans on bombs dropped by a Democratic president land Korea was also done by the um when I'm\nHarry Truman was in and also LBJ escalated the war in Vietnam so we had four democratic person in the twentieth century that got us involved in wars\nOkay [laughter] Hi hey a bill for the call thanks for joining us on well you\nKnow I have to I answered strapped away from ... ... after Pearl Harbor bombed the liberal Republican president we would have just a bad break guys will have to repair the show so I mean we're we're low shuttles were circumstances I Will say it is\nThe Democrats I find it falls I'm like you got refusing to find Bush's fault we're it falls in Vietnam and Democrats night we own that was your old Vietnam ended it with ... bank on top of them as you would\nBe amazed number of Republican that find a lot of phone with Bush and the what's going on them yeah and I I I Would be more vulnerable because you're ... and this is this is not the show to go into Saudi Arabia but I'll tell you right now\nThat that you know there is no more Iraq as a bastion to Iran because of Bush foreign policy\nAnd if I had to do over on that one I Would have let the guy in place on course you would have so one would have made him our dictated you don't know that ahead of time All right let's go to Theresa appreciate your holding thanks for joining us on the voice of taxes go at Georgia\nWell actually two white than stories at one idea for the border search All right go ahead okay first off or to search\nI Would love to see them do a easy die if they decide to rush the border between our guard\nOh where everybody's blue turns blue or something yeah one of those bank deals with a guy goes off\nExactly they they use the where they couldn't see it and that would last for weeks and so if anyone is stopped and they got ... die on they noted they automatically\nThat their rights are Theresa here's the problem okay so they all going to come to the border and when they cross\nThey're going to all claim political asylum and they're not going to run they're not going to enter a legally they're going to crossing claimed political asylum and because they claim political asylum and because of our mess up immigration laws\nWhen because we don't have enough capacity to hold\nThe people we have much less the ten thousand that have been walk across we're going to let them go and we're going to give him time to show back up in a couple of years to have an asylum hearing and the ones that can't justify asylum will never show up\nAnd the one out of ten they can we'll we'll probably get to stay because the Supreme Court already ruled on it\nSo by the way if you tune in next week to the street view I'll give you exactly how it works there are also going to end the telephone you and Jerry Brown has already said that he has fleets of welcome wagons waiting for him\nThey crossed they holler asylum they get the one the one foot rule to fill up the paper and Jerry is going to provide them transport it anywhere they want an open up the welcome mat\nThey're heading that luckily they're hitting the
