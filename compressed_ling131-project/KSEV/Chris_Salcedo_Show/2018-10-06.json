C. dot com\nToday we're facing together the reality that the things we have done to provide for comfort comfortable retirement are not working for us\nWe've been discussing a business model you can use while still working in your current W to job or running your current business that will allow you to replace your earned income with cash flow from your real estate investments and the next two to five years that's doable\nBefore the break I promise to share the five reasons we believe real estate is the most effective vehicle for creating the passive income and these five income sources are the result of input\nEating the passive income and these five income sources are the result of implementing the real estate investment strategy my mentor ... and our team at lifestyles unlimited taught me\nSo let's go through these five steps um we may not get through all of them in this segment but we'll definitely be able to do it before the end of the show today so the five ways that you can make money as a real estate investor if you run your business correctly\nOr the the first one is cash flow\nThat is the most important thing cash flow is the reason we seek passive income producing assets without cash flow you don't have income right so you're four O. one K.\nEven daring market cycles where you are making money and your four one K. there's no cash flow going into your bank account from it it's something that's far often in the distant future and you can't live off of your\nFour o one K now you can't quit your job without cash flow\nWe don't buy an investment property and less the rental income is greater fire reasonable margin than the monthly expenses so let me give you a realistic example when your ten it pays you\nTwelve hundred dollars a month to live in your rental property and your monthly expenses including principal and trips taxes and insurance and maintenance reserves\nAre nine hundred dollars a month that three hundred dollar difference is now income for you that's cash deposit it in your bank account every month that cash that can support your lifetime\nNumber two is equity capture you capture equity when you buy a property\nIn real estate you capture equity when you buy property and have the right team to increase its value to repairs and improvements to the property\n[noise] if you buy a property in a neighborhood where the properties are valued at around two hundred thousand [noise] and you can buy it for a hundred and fifty thousand because of its current condition you can fix it up for about twenty thousand dollars then you're all in for a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars\nYou just captured thirty thousand dollars and equity that increases your net worth\nIt's like having thirty thousand dollars in cash sitting in the bank of one two three main street right\n[noise] see what their investment vehicles to create wealth so quickly without equity you're exposing yourself to the rest of the falling markets so we buy assets with equity that's our focus\nOther businesses can be good sources of cash flow but they don't offer an opportunity to buy an asset for less\nThan it's worth and capture that actually the third reason is principal pay down\nAnd here's a way we make money and real estate that most people don't think about we accumulate equity in our investment properties over time as our tenants pay down our mortgage\nSo even if you weren't making money any other way\nYour tennis would be paying down your mortgage a little bit each month granted it starts out small you know might be fifty or a hundred dollars a month but as time goes on it grows and it adds to your equity and the property and this is unique to real estate\nAnd a powerful wealth building process\nWe will return in just a few minutes and I will complete the list of the five reasons we believe real estate is the best business trip to create the wealth and passive income you need to retire and the next two to five years if you have a question now is a great time to call and get on the line for\nThe next segment that number's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eight seven seven seven eleven fifty

lip\nMorale and today we're working together to adopt new beliefs about the best way to earn the money you need to retire since our jobs are current businesses for one k.'s and other investment vehicles haven't worked\nIn the past two segments we talked about the five returns real estate is the most effective vehicle to create this wealth in Pasadena income that cash\nFlow you need to retire and then Paul called for memorial city in the last segment and asked is investing in apartment communities is the only way to retire in two to five years as a real estate investor ... are you still there\nYeah yeah okay thank you for holding through the break because this is a question I think that a lot of people have and and the simplest answer is that if you have the resources\nTo begin investing in apartment communities you will get to retirement faster\nSo what kind of research has on my talking about it it's not just cash in the bank we began the whole show today by\nTalking about I'm\nA new business model and then going through defining what you want as an individual your vision of the lifestyle you want and then I invited people to go to a nother pod cast of a radio show that I did with courting chain\nAnd the title of that is get your assets\nTo work and that takes you through a process of looking at what that equity you have\nSo you've got land that you're paying taxes on that you think you want to build on in the future and sat land that you can sell and use that to actually get to retirement 'cause right now you're never going to build that house you've got to get to retirement first so\nMaybe you've got recreational vehicles extra cars that things that are costing you money and not making any money that you\nCan use as a resource to begin to invest it you have enough to go into apartment that is a great way to start I'm going to tell you in a minute why how much do you need the next question right Paul [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah um typically we say you need about fifty thousand dollars to start with department investing and for that to make sense\nIf you don't have that you can begin with a process we call the investment snowball again that's another another show that you can find out there on pod cast a show I did several years ago\nAnd still applies and it's a real simple concept you save up as much money as you can you scaled back of your life\nSo that you can save money and you buy that first house that all the money you make on that first child gets added to the money you're still saving\nAnd you'll be able to buy that second house it all seems like it's a little bit long to be able to do it but the third will come quicker to Fort they'll come quicker and by the time you have ten houses you're going to be able to run them for a couple of years\nAnd then either refinance those properties are seldom and moved to apartment community so why the move to apartment community\nHere's the reason [noise]\nSingle family homes are valued based on what the people around you are buying and selling homes for so no matter how well you run them the fact that it looks like a million bucks that does help a little bit right the fact that looks like a million bucks and that you've always had a tenant and a tenant has always pay their rent none of that\nIncreases the diet that property because there's a top end of what people are going to pay for the single family homes in that neighborhood\nBut per neck communities are different their value based on net operating income so if you can't operate that property better I if you can increase its curb appeal if\nProperty better if you can creatures curb appeal if you can't screen tennis so that you have to pay their rent\nIf you can also creates referral but if you're a good operator and you can create your own operating in time\nI just ten percent you're going to be able to double your investment in the property that's the way the numbers workout and sticky to reaching retirement and two to five years\nAgo from a few few single family out of the sort of Harvard complex\nAnd you can't get rich so five year time frame I started an apartment and depending on how much you start with two years or reasonable timeframe people start with Jerry for single family home investment\nAnd in two to three years they've been retired for five years is a really reasonable goals\nBut you've got to work the process a little like that's the way you make it happen Paul thanks for your call we do have to go to another story even better to find out how to stay right here

master if you order\nAddict insulation ordinarily a dollar Ninety a square foot it's an eight inch added fifty percent off it's only Ninety five ten Ninety five cents to wait one nine three six zero five five nine time before we get back into the addict discussion holidays are coming up and when your friends and family come over\nAnd they come to your front door what's the first thing they say oh I just said it\nFront door the front door [laughter] you're already blue I Know [laughter] it's like and the kids for Halloween up the punch line you know that you want to go door to win back on the door to door it's all nasty yeah and\nYou don't want them giving you a trick if you don't treat if your door look bad maybe they'll\nDo so I look at look at it that says that that you don't get effects of turn the light ... nobody comes to your door you [laughter] we've had a\nDream qualified home service provider a check a pro that does front door refinishing\nUm they're called sturdy doors refinishing they have a deal here ordinarily they charge three hundred dollars time for a standard\nI'm six foot eight and store I think that's the standards I a six foot eight in the door and instead of three hundred dollars it's only two hundred and forty nine dollars they're giving me five of these deals today so if you are interested in this and you're listening now and then when you get your front door he finished within the next six or eight weeks\nIt'd be a good time to call it's only two hundred and forty nine dollars to get your front door we finished they time they strip it down you can pick your choice\nOf staying\nHealthy to change the color change color tired of the other random match what you have no but sometimes it's hard to tell what you have because what you have so deteriorated gone yeah they're gonna like colored or they get so bad it looks dark yeah\nAnd on the other side of the door the cherry say well that was probably that look even good even that is going to change over the years because of everything they put on top of your thing and so forth things can yellow and change like right in any case only two hundred and forty nine dollars if not three hundred said\nA over fifty dollars today to wait one three nine seven three Seventy nine only five people will get this deal today\nCalled now to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine\nFive people will get this deal today call now to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine one more time to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine we talked about adding insulation and the first segment Tom\nIt's important I Would I Would say that if you have to have that at work done and you're deficient in insulation I Would probably have that done first unless you have absolutely no ventilation but chances are you have some\nUm and then I'd probably do radiant barrier lab depending upon if I had trees or other buildings that were shadow in my house\nYeah I thought yeah every how it's a little different um insulation definitely are almost every house that we do we add insulation are a lot more data will will go on wet insulation we'll put a couple of solar fans in and maybe you had a radio or all all at once it just depends on the house we just did a health um yesterday\nAnd it was a removal and we did new a new insulation Scott all the old inflation so offended by they already had a right to reading ... or so in that case they didn't really mean and he really didn't even need the radio that they had it wasn't really giving them the value because it was there's a lot of trees over the roof\nOf soda and a case like that if they hadn't had ready but I wouldn't have recommended it because it was over in king would end was covered in trees\nSo the insulation made way more sense you're going to get a lot of bang for money quick return on investment always tell people I like to kind of giving realistic expectations so I'm not going to say well you put a solar fan and it's going to pay for itself in three months\nThat's probably not the case it might be a year or depending on the on the attic temperatures and what's going on and maybe a three year pay back and then I let them make the decision which way they want to go because some people will say well you know through your pay but it's pretty good at thirty three percent on my money that's not bad\nPlus you get to a tax credit missing certain things so we kind of go over all that will come out and we do the analysis and that's really the best place to start when you're doing looking at doing an addict is take a look at it but an expert look at it and see what you actually need\nA lot of times you don't need everything just like taking your car into the shop and doesn't necessarily need break in the battery and a new windshield and new tires and it doesn't need to everything and maybe it maybe doesn't he decided tires\nBut you don't have a car if you haven't seen [laughter] heard of it had a lawyer and everything maybe two years old maybe you might want to go somewhere else get second opinions so we don't do that will look at the addict can see what it actually needs but um and then the radiant barrier you know if it's exposed to the sun\nAnd you've got dark shingles that you definitely need to do like your your black roof yeah of course you need rating barrier\nYeah you know if you if you can that you want to do that but if you don't have any installation and then I Would still anymore let's start with inflation I probably going to do one a lot of times if it's not a real big house like well let's just do what we're doing the same time because most of our project we can do within a day or\nDoesn't take too long usually a couple of hours per function so for doing insulation figure a couple of hours right in a couple of hours so usually most people they want to take a day off of work to actually do the work we can do it all in one day and we also do Saturday appointments and do installed on Saturday does well\nFifty percent off certain he'd blown in insulation stake here on the chicken ... radio show for my friend Tom decker addict innovations he'll put an eight inch ad and on top of what you have it makes a huge difference who did it in my home I Love it I've got three different addict as well uh ordinarily a dollar Ninety ... square foot only Ninety five\nPercent six callers can get it however three of already gotten it yes with Ellen\nYet so we'll have been so basically when they call will come out with the addict analysis and that they like if they need insulation them will honor that price for that so I set up a few people call me or I'll get out there and I says oh I I was one of the first cars are finally getting the whole house full of free installations like\nNo it's a free addict analysis ... somethings show everybody because we're in the studio straightforward it's a free analysis will come out and look at it and see what you need and then we'll give you fifty percent off the whatever the insulation of that that's what you need it if you needed maybe don't need it maybe maybe it would be a better option so really the ... come on look at it and then we'll go from there that's the best thing to do\nOkay to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly three more callers can get the deal and before we move into radium barrier and solar addict fans I Want to just finish this deal to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if this is something you think that you want to have done within the next\nFour six eight weeks home now it's something you want to have done next year leave the phone open for people who really want that because Tom can only give the deal with it so many people\nYeah we get that too sometimes some will get\nPeople the oh I get out there like oh we're going to do something we're thinking like maybe two years we're actually going out of the country for six months like Kobe and six month because [laughter] you know some of the good even changed over the fix my maybe and say what they decide well now we're going to sell the house and\nWell now we just want to bring it up to maybe in our thirties ... to pass minimum building code we don't want to do the are thirty eight so kind of you know do it when you're ready if it\nTo me there's no time like the president so if you're thinking about doing its legend and he's thinking well maybe in two years we're going to sell the house but when you sell it they're going to do a home inspection and then they're going to look at the inflation and if it doesn't meet building code is going to come up on the inspection report is insufficient inflation and somebody's gonna want you to pay for it\nSo if you do it out within the two years they can pay for itself just in energy savings and you don't worry about it we put gauges in there and you're you're good to go so\nReally is no time like the president to do insulation\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine is Tom's number Tom Kean into the phone right now sometimes she does but he's on the air right now it goes to trust the staff at the office they're fantastic\nUm you know I have to complement you and your team often when people in an office or answering the phone\nIn a customer service department at at home service business like yours they're just not as sharp as your people I mean people are ... they're very educated on the process in the product right there courteous and if they don't have an answer they'll get it\nSo you know I like the map to tap for people who have done this before someone at the two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nThey're addict is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet exactly so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radicals that can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah we'll measured because most people have kind of an idea that I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or whatever is in like OK and will measure and it's like yeah sure enough it's right on that kind of the normal will just come out we do a quick measure make sure everybody on the same page and we'll get them the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot\nOr so we don't say oh email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kinda stuff will give you the price right there is about so you know right where you stand and that way you can say you know while the radio was say say the radio was twelve hundred and the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be best\nAnd then we can make a decision then we can talk over the options the pros and cons of of each so that's why I like to give prices right on the spot so people know where they can and they can make an educated decision versus just saying if I just emailed him over all the pricing later then but they they don't know which way to go because\nWe're not there and we can't really talk about it and yeah it's better to get it out and we'll sit down even if it takes an hour to to go over well we'll talk to you and we'll figure it out of most of our appointments really led to take about thirty to forty five minutes will come up in the attic\nTakes maybe ten minutes ago everything we have him and if you want to ... you know give us cookies or something what we'll do that too but it doesn't take long to do this process we're not there to keep\nYou know banging on your and making you want to buy something I had a company come out one time they were trying to sell me a some stuff from my house and there were there for four hours like this is ridiculous and just like what are you guys doing it's like\nBeing lower our our eyes or you know have you didn't say that's why they're there for four yeah he kept saying oh it's like you know I think if people are saying well we're going to think about her I talked to my wife when she gets home I'm like\nGreat let's find let's let me know she has any questions give me a call this I'll give you my cell phone number and we'll just you know I'm happy to I'm happy to leave for like your your call me back and we're just confident we're going to get the business of the customers actually going to do an addict job we're going to get to work because our reputation as so solid\nFifty percent off the radiant barrier today heat block all Trump\nIt's not two dollars today that's normal price but here on the check a pro radio show for my listeners is only a dollar per foot dollar per square foot fifty percent off to wait one nine three six zero five five nine how many of these are you giving away\nToday I'm wanting to for those reasons we do a little less on those because we have to do radio ... in the morning because he just gets too hot and they add on to do the radiant work or do we limit that a little bit more ... will do for those\nFour to eight one nine three six zero five five night for callers only I'm so radium barrier it's something that some of my listeners will need to order from you in some ... and that is because\nUm for the past handful of years builders have put them in New bills\nYes all the new construction has radiant bear the houses six or seven years old or you know we're older than that then there's a good chance they they don't have already had barrier\nAnd if you don't have any merit than it is probably an eighty percent chance that we would recommend you know the reason we wouldn't recommend it is the houses it's completely covered in ... you know you just don't have that radiant energy hitting the roots of why would you need it\nOr um if you are getting some somebody but you we have unbelievable ventilation in the attic\nAnd we feel like well the heat coming in but it's being exhausted properly you maybe don't need a rainy there or sometimes will say well you know you could use or anywhere but maybe the a little more ventilation would be a little less caustic ... expensive below more cost effective to go ahead and just put a ... fan\nSo that's all we do the addict analysis on your recommended reading but I have it in my house and of course\nUm I Would never have a house without a rainy and Barry but especially if you're exposed to very close to you know it was if it was like the magnolia and it was covered with trees I did have a house out there and it didn't have already buried and it was under three hundred percent trees I didn't need a Green Beret and put it in there was no point\nI'm just insulated really well so sometimes there's different things that we can do maybe we can\nIf you're leaning one way that maybe we over insulated a little bit just spending on on the house and how it's structured\nOr somehow 'cause you can't put more inflation because they've got it all decked him they store stuff up there addict\nAnd the good stuff everywhere it's like okay well we really need to work on the addict temperature because we can't get enough insulation there because you ... stuff up there so that would definitely would record ... origin or radio bear and then they'd be some sort of fans we want to keep the temperature down as low as possible so every house with a little different that's why we do the canal says\nHow many of these can you give away today or for for the audience yes call now too late one nine three six zero five five nine if you're interested in getting radiant barrier done if your house is older than you don't have it you should consider it how do you know if you haven't gone to your attic if there is nothing silver on the roof deck and when you're looking up\nYeah just walk banks's you pull the stairs I'll look up you didn't need to go up in there you know ... exactly\nTo see nails coming through from the shingles if the decorating and the nails are not silver or there's nothing over it right meaning of silvery and very then there's different types and you\nDon't have it called time to
