people registered for the Trump cruise event tonight as you know there is a Trump cruise Ted Cruz rally over at a Toyota Center downtown and they've got there's it only holds about Eighteen thousand people\nBut it looks like there's well over Eighteen thousand people have the event over a hundred thousand people register for tickets there's things going on outside so we were hanging out outside and watching live music and reforms are going to be speeches their TV screens their food trucks and there was all kinds of cool stuff going on\nOver there at the um the Toyota Center and out in the

there's [noise] there's a lot of people and they were hanging out traffic is going to be terrible down in that area and you weren't down in that area either leave early early really late because\nHe traffics going to be awful today because I don't know if there's anything else going on but\nI just know there's going to be how many thousands of people who have no idea how you doing one five five eight KGB if you want to join us uh we're also talking about the migrant caravan now a national emergency with the reports of up to ten thousand people\n[noise] ten thousand people in the care of and that is broke through fences in southern Mexico and just making their way up there they're coming whether we like it or not I think it's real about that [noise] should we just say okay\nWhat about this caravan or the next one of the ... does it matter I mean obviously that's a good two weeks on the border about ten thousand people coming into our country [noise] but when a group of\nPeople they have this big giant care of and they're coming they burn an American flag with a swastika painted on edge they've got their carrying flags from their countries one of them has a huge huge Trump\nTies I'm a flag for Honduras they're showing you got one of these migrants says blasting Donald Trump on CNN saying he is the anti Christ and if he doesn't ... he's going to help this sounds more like\nAn invasion is this a little more invasion to you and should the president put the troops on the border National Guard who's on the other people what do you think\nDoing one five five eight K. SETV to a one five five eight five seven three eight only get your take on this I'm the president tweeted out there was some unknown Middle Eastern people involved in this caravan\nThe media went crazy incidents undocumented you can't do this and verified he's completely lotteries Trump these racist these ... and then we find out from judicial watch over one hundred ISIS terrorists have been\nCaught in their mind law as this caravan makes its way towards the U. S.\nSo clearly you got a group of I don't know anywhere from seven to ten thousand people clearly we know exactly who's in that group I mean clearly the Democrats on the left to well thanks to their divine leadership by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer\nAre being quiet about their ignoring it they don't want to talk about it there I saw one report on it today and it was a ... a lady reporter interviewing a couple of migrant children and how sad it was and have terrible and that their journey is just beginning\nWho's paying for these people you know nobody crosses that to a U.S Mexico border without paying the drug cartels anywhere from five thousand ten Fifteen twenty thousand dollars right there just ten thousand people will say let's go low you know let's say seven thousand [noise]\nIs it seven thousand people much money that from the drug cartels you know the human smugglers who raped women and children who leave them to die on a regular basis you know those people the ones that are you know that also control the drug cartels\nAre cutting people's heads off and drop them into pieces of murdering thousands and thousands and thousands of people each year I mean you know whatever\nWho these borders right\nTo lead one five five eight KGB to anyone five five eight five seven three eight let's go to for instance go hanging out and Katie for instance do things for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nI'm doing well for instance do how are you\nA re than I Am at the same and health in okay I'll tell you what let's put it let the methods that verify the progressive liberals who hate America so much and let's see if they're if they're willing to switch there a censorship that say that the the immigrants to take their place\nBut you know that's a good point but these are the same people that supposedly got really upset when the president called those countries these people were coming from asshole or grapples if you will think that you can't do that Bush is a lot of crap hole if they're not bad places\nAnd these people really deserve to be American citizen how many of them would swap places within that was a great friend just go\nYeah exactly hey and I got another one on the what was that well that are that old data on ... how they want to end or two [laughter] I don't know when\nDid you get as a throw you off of my question apologize for instance issued an eye on that one man\nAnd it's All right have you made a good point I appreciate the Gulf for instance go under you'll you maybe you can always goes back and we'll we'll get to it let's go to Aaron listening on the west side here and thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nSharon\nOh ... the way it was written down so he wants to Sharon Sharon sure go ahead Sharon what's on your mind is that I'm reading\nHi Chris I was just thinking listening to talk about the heroin that maybe there should be an event with the news media is blacked out that they don't cover it because every time the liberal media at the whole something like this they don't that they they exaggerate uh they make things\nYou know they had tried everything around a ... and and I just don't see any\nPoint in doing that and I think the flight a purpose of these people trying to make this round up at the border they said what the public and I think if they don't get it I think it it just kind of takes it down and not I mean I I Would even make it a no fly zone choppers drones\nNothing that's not the government handle it and\n... well that was the only problem is we do have a free press in this country so there's that and I and when I say the only problem I I prefer a free press if they would just\nYou know take the responsibility seriously instead of being a propaganda arm\nFor the Democrat Party but nonetheless I Do want to cover no tell you why because we're seeing them burning in American flag we're seeing them flying flags of the countries they're supposedly escaping oppression from and we're seeing them say things like calling the president of our country the anti Christ is going to hell\nThere why if it's so terrible why in the world are you a skating this terrible stuff to come to a place so awful and flying the flag and the police are coming from Missouri that might I\nMight point out that you know selling them doing that that that gives them what they want so if they were truly a true for people who were fighting oppression in their country they wouldn't be doing that so obviously that's not who they are\nAnd so they're they're they're coming and doing this for a different reason so just don't get them the entertainment value that they want\nFrom what ... what other reason do you do you have a suspicion of what'd you think that other reason maybe\nOh of course I mean I think there's a there's a a coup kind of going on in this country right now I don't know who's behind it a lot of speculation it's got someone with a lot of money made that Carlos Slim George Soros\nA consortium of others who knows that this country all of a sudden has signed nuts and it didn't happen overnight and this kind of event that happened overnight you you can't tell me that ten thousand people got together and said okay we're going to intensify hanging off it just doesn't happen it's it's it's orchestrated\nYeah it's sort of a coordinated event because they're not like I don't know who's coordinating and I do know there's no one cross that border without paying a whole boatload of money to get across and you're looking at seven ten thousand people at the very least you're looking at a lot of money cross that border because that's the way the human smugglers\nYeah but I yeah well that's right like even maybe some people might think pay as well as as as was pointed out even look at the crowds and what makes up that crowd it starts as women and little kid is have a body man\nAnd so obviously you know why don't they say their country and make their own countries that are ... why don't we go back to their country and get back to that but we given to them is that right I\nI've heard it and it is difficult thing for the call or don't appreciate it\nIt is difficult to understand this and I've heard other people say they want you to stay in your own country make it better well that's a whole lot easier said than done to these countries are the asshole they were supposedly referred to as a crop holes that are corrupt\nThey're corrupt to the core lookout corrupt Mexico is when they're run by horrible people and you often end up dismembered or destroyed in your family tortured and killed in very bad things can happen to you in these places so it's a whole lot even though it is a very arduous journey is very difficult to come to America\nIt's a far better off to me which is why most come\nThe reality is the vast majority of people who come to America are able bodied men young men\nThere are women and children that come to but most of them are men\nAnd adults finds that most of them are adults\nSo there's a lot to this as long as humans are I don't know these people are being paid either there's part of that though the caravan is growing through Mexico because a lot of Mexicans who want to get her as well so\nThat being said the timing is seems a bit suspect coming up to the midterms and I think the more they showed on the media the more it's only going to help\nYou know embolden the president and the people who support him let's go to Steve and holding in Houston Steven thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice from Texas\nIs or a a much they are the customer or it's usually a lot of scholars boy you know if you think about how hard it is to organize a an office party for twenty people\nYou know the scope of\nYou know how how in church it er and again the the suspect is on the timing and it's it's right at the exact time at the elections are happening and you know it it it\nKind of you know puts me in the mindset of\nYou know if you're looking at uh one of the only thing that you know the dams were causing or were able to call the president to a kind of cave on with the whole separating of the children are at the borders and you know this this whole situation they're looking at it it's a Hail Mary from the Democrats\nAnd as being funded and call the shots are being called from up on a a but none of this has happened by accident\nIt should be for the call Steven ... you made the right I don't know if people saying these are people paying this I don't know we honestly in two weeks we get more than ten thousand people crossing the border regularly anyway that are paying\nThese you know these cartels these human smugglers to get across to the numbers just because they're all in one big called caravan if you will it's it's a whole lot more daunting as a whole lot different I don't know whatever just approaches\nIn in my opinion from what I'm watching I think it's only going to help Republicans in the mid term\nPeople are looking at this when they see them burning those lives they see them carrying flags on their own country\nThe the media the news does not have a stronghold over information anymore they can't do people go on the Internet that happened I'm looking right now I see them like Mexican black Honduran flags ... I see them flying flags and\nAll that does is make most people here in America logical minded individuals other than these liberals whose brains have fallen out of their heads it makes us go way he'll do we need a positive result that these people aren't ...\nFallen out of their heads it makes us go way he'll do we need to apologize for these people aren't scraping they're doing something ... you don't you don't carry the flag of the country you're taping when it's tyranny right oh let's go Francisco very quick we've run out of time for instance feel did you remember what you were going to

fact one on the inside of Andy Kohut from the inside that there were a few seats were meeting in the top but I have a feeling those are probably gone by now I just saw a clip on the news a little while ago\nThere didn't look like there's anywhere else in that place and it's filled up and clearly it only holds about Eighteen thousand people so the other eighty plus thousand people that they show up they can partake\nIn the festivities outside there's food trucks there's live music there is a big TV screen so they can see what's going on I don't I don't know the televised and it's going

of weeks learn where your early voting locations are\nI'm Sorry I'm going to get out right now Republicans are outpacing Democrats in early voting in the key states so that's good news for Republicans\nRepublicans need to stay motivated the president is also alerted the military the migrants caravan is now a national emergency with the reports of body where between seven and ten thousand people they're burning American flags or fly the flags of the countries are supposedly escaping tyranny from it doesn't make sense\nIn a related story you one hundred ISIS terrorists have been caught in Guatemala\nHas this migrant caravan heading toward the U.S who are who is all in this caravan\nWho's in it\nGive you their names Social Security numbers oh that's right they're not American citizens nobody really knows who in his caravan and the report earlier the president said there are no middle Easterners and some criminals mixed in how do you know there isn't\nThere is a um

email now at tech and thrive from a good friend of mine is eating Tex Mex at a restaurant and Conrad on TV is on than his language Haitians and they're covering the ... center and they're interviewing\nSpanish speaking at ten days to are very supportive\nTrapping going either Trump beat the crap I thought that was pretty cool mile\nYeah I did and and the other thing I wanted to mention that I loved want America needs that they are selling\nTrump rally they show all the time five rallies the entire thing where a lot and it kind of capital not to let people know that on the other thing that\nAre on TV today they're reporting that the president of Mexico Canada the U.S to form a coalition and go help you know bill ... job from Guatemala or something and help the people there that way and and and that's good that sounds wonderful it didn't say\nThat Trump is doing just the opposite that he\nHe's cutting the you know foreign aid to the country and I hope people cats at\nThe foreign aid to those countries is very different from helping the people and building up their economies separate from the point I probably go right into the pocket of the current leader and that's good that we cut foreign aid because then that hurt them I I wouldn't be surprised that there\nIn Canada and Mexico and do something to\nBuild an economy of course she forgot to get rid of current leader for\nThat yeah that would that's the hard part is when was it the right the hard part is dealing with the corruption and trying to get the money to the people and it's we've seen this problem with\nBut you know the the band aid remember the aid for Africa and Ethiopia and all these other countries I think the caller's with we've seen this over and over again we're very little of the money of any goes to the people these corrupt leaders jumping in and they tend to take it and they burn it and then they continue to oppress there people are or what have you and we're talking about Latin America it is\nVery corrupt down there all the way down the line Mexico um during all those countries El Salvador Guatemala\nAnd get out of it as well it's great over there remember that's the socialist utopia the Michael Moore and Sean Penn and all the Democrats told so awesome it was because they had universal healthcare how's that working out for him\nYou know they all preached it back then but now the and we can't use it as an example of socialism anymore because it proved us right thanks for the call is go to Jennifer in the woodland Jennifer thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHello Jennifer are you there but can you not hear me yeah I can hear you now Jennifer go ahead\nI'm you know I've been watching the immigration\nComing through and I'm a schoolteacher and I teach I teach kids uh I had my classes you know our English second language and it's really tough on them and the only thing that I always think about what I'm looking at\nThe gentlemen who had a little light and they hit the order if they get that far they're going to put the women and children up front\nAnd Jim ... support\nOn women and children you know if that's the needs to go or if that anybody is taking it needs to go there got up and I'm thinking you know I'm a Republican woman he thought I ... a Christian Woman and I think you know you let the women on the children and they put the tension centers heat that family unit together\nThat she did not let them in it because you you not know if you do not go there and check if their husbands hang around there are a lot of probably unfortunately find try to find another way to get in but I the last thing I Would like to see is Donald Trump hated as\nAn even more evil man coming in to these ... catch John a wonderful job that I can find areas humanitarian but very level headed and stuff so\nThere's transportation that in that case when they get next to a border we all know that Mexico runs on\nOn money and if you wanna you wanna do something to getting the Mexico you ought to get a car in Mexico or whatever you agree somebody's all those guys those those fall at the border that that are out like\nIf there's money behind this they're racing their palms let a staple through it got pittance compared to what it called coughing so Renee the\nBob you brought up a great point they're feeding a little odd people now I'll disagree with I don't think they're really great dressed but nonetheless they look relatively healthy ... yeah\nI Know that try to not laughing at a men's but but they're not yesterday\nYeah soon as you and your point is valid in ... when you're talking about who's ... wherever they get the money to feed themselves you got a group was over seven thousand people now that a lot of meals each day they're working their way through their Donald just walking some are riding on trucks and all the where's all this coming from and then you mentioned the palms getting resistance\nThese federal rallies or ... believes the off and then when you get to the border nobody crosses without going through the human smugglers they gave the drug cartels and you're looking at five thousand bucks a pop at that point so clearly had a\nBritish somebody be Ron we're going to get a great that way like five thousand I Am I whatever I had you know you want something or you want nothing and how you know it's a cardio like a car you know maybe not much has it by you know no doubt in my mind\nThat those officials\nAt the border the Mexican border got their palms grace and like just step back and said y'all ammonia\nBut it's you know they only put the thank you for the call Bob appreciate it you're right they only put like twenty more people to try to stop at the southern border and they broke down the fence and just walked right past them so clearly they did everything they could within their power to try to stop this\nHoard of merging people telling us they're coming into our country and there's not a damn thing we can do about it while waving the flag of another country sounds a lot like an invasion to me was doing my listening and surely and my next spring it on hold them to the voice of Texans\nHey Chris rock I appreciate the previous caller you order up a really good point that ah there's obviously money so men to a lot of what we're seeing come from the left to rot and who are trying to harm the United states and for one\nOr not or some three letter government agencies operative deal with the likes a Mr Soros or some others who are clearly enemies of the United states\nAnd uh I I'm part of me as a shock that ... that that hasn't been dealt with a already but uh I Would not shed one cheer for the last couple of like\nWell the only problem with that is when it comes to that sort of stuff that we've seen these other countries I don't want to open the door and my country I don't want to go sort of fascinating citizens\nOf our country because we disagree with him politically even if they are as big of a comeback and funder of nefarious activities or say George Soros I Would much rather see 'em arrested if he's doing anything illegal and that sort of stuff I don't want to open the door to that\nBecause the other side as we saw during the Obama administration will use whatever avenue that is available to them to um well to push their agenda and we\nI think we've already gone far too far in that direction [noise] okay well is Mr ... an American citizen a you know what I I don't know that's a good point I I don't believe he is yeah yeah that's true and that you may be right\nTo do what Mr services doing some other country\nThat they're doing it because I was an attack the United states I think the United states needs to respond and I don't think it's inappropriate in case like if he can hide behind you know being a billionaire and kind of looked like somebody who are legitimate but this is no less than attack\nAn attack then uh you know coming after our country where with guns and knives\nWhenever you made the right I'm not sure thank you for the call I appreciated Mike I just once again I don't know if he's a citizen or not I ... I thought he was but nonetheless him spending lots of money and you're right he's a millionaire and he can spend lots and lots of money trying to push his political way in our country and wants to get as much as I don't like that I Do like freedom\nAnd once again you've got to be very careful when you start going down that slippery slope the moment you start going out and taken out people like that because I see a threat to our democracy well it depends on the way you look at it he's clearly a threat to my political way of thinking but he is he truly a threat to our democracy are are Republicans who will ...\nIs he doing things illegal and that kind of level that's different ball game but the reality is I I you know I don't know and I'm like I said I'm not about going in and killing people like that\nWhy don't we handle him with the American tourists should get involved enough and paying enough attention and we can't prevent are tend to remain taken over much some jerk clown like George Soros\nWe get the government we deserve I mean we have the ability to kind of the way I look at it I think you were the call appreciate it we've got Tony hanging on in the ... things were hanging on welcome to the voice of ...\nYou know I'm ...
