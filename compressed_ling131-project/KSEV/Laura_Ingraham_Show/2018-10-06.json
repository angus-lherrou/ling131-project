completely different [noise]\nThan everything you've been told by others beforehand\nReal the real story a whole lot of the lambs Robert shows by clarity financial life money tan sweater now will\nLast Robert [noise]\nDuring the last Roberts pie gas talk about irrational exuberance today because well\nWhile the markets continue and they're very bullish trend over the last decade the question becomes you know have we gone too far\nA in relation to what the underlying earnings and growth of the economy actually are you know when we talk about irrational exuberance clearly sustained low inflation implied to lessen certainly about the future and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of socks another earning that's that's\nWhat the simply means is that when you have low inflation and low interest rate that should theoretically lead the higher end set price as\nWell and that's the way it's worked throughout history um in fact\nWhen we do that but how do we know when irrational exuberance says unduly escalated out said values which then become subject to unexpected and pro long contractions as they have been in Japan over the last decade\nInterestingly enough that was said by Alan Greenspan in Nineteen Ninety six or the famous line irrational exuberance was as that's at prices were moving into one of the fastest steep and sharpest rises\nAnd us history from Nineteen Ninety take the Nineteen Ninety nine of course that was the peak of the dot com boom market exuberance at that point of course led to the dot com crash said shortly followed\nThe but as we look at this hour we once again seeing very much the same thing in the markets today you know interestingly the market since the election has had a very very strong in advance and of course we've had three massive hurricanes we had two major wildfires billions and funding is being put to work\nUh since the beginning of this year and you'll notice right here the steep decline in the deficit starting in October of Seventeen or by the way this is when\nUm the hurricanes hit and we began funding for ... solving a lot of these hurricanes wildfires et cetera I sharp decrease in the increasing the deficit money flowing into the economy\nOf courts combined with tax cuts has led to this continued ride in the markets of course over the last several months and again expectations are currently that well this will just continue because earnings are fantastic well earnings are fantastic because of tax cuts\nAnd of course a lot of the issues are with repatriation of dollars going share buybacks joining example of something here\nThis is reported earnings are for the S. and P. going back to two thousand fourteen and this is the key\nDid earnings are for the ... going back to two thousand fourteen and this is the cumulative percent change in earnings so in other words in two thousand fourteen accumulated percent change in earnings was about two two and a half percent\nA back there it didn't slow down and two thousand Fifteen sixteen when we went through kind of the uh the uh weak economic environment a beginning and and twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen known as paper tantrum and that was in the fed was raising interest rates\nAre already starting to recover late twenties early twenty Seventeen of course when we got the tax cuts Bush we saw this big jump and\nEarnings per share Allen after tax page of the word sin tax cuts provided a huge boost\nTo corporate profitability of course combined with some of the sharp introduction to share back in us history over a trillion dollars worth of ... a buyback slated for this year alone but let's take out the tax cut for just a moment\nOr something and saw voices\nAbout in the last thing I guess about the irrational exuberance we\nCurrently exist in the market and again we're talking about a markets has been driven by years of super accommodate a policy low interest rates low inflation trillions of dollars worth of financial support whether it's governmental support or Federal Reserve central banks\nEt cetera which is driven asset prices and elevated asset prices well above long term means a well above what actual price in profitability would dictate more importantly what what economic growth would dictate\nSo the question becomes how do you navigate that type of a market well we talked about man's you read the managing portfolios all the time and as a portfolio manager and there's some basic rules of managing money manager your portfolio that\nThey're not my rules I didn't create them these are rules that have been involved over time through experience and through other people's experiences and the ... the best way to learn about managing your own money and trading your own money\nIs by looking at people that have been through this before the habits tablets themselves as great traders people like Paul tutor Jones Benjamin Graham et cetera\nAnd what you'll find is when you when you look at their philosophies in their principals they may all word it differently Warren Buffett says rule number one don't lose money rule number to\nRefer back to rule number one well that's the same principle as as Paul tutor John saying don't buy losers so it's not a question of how they're worded the question and and the message is basically the same between all major great investors of our time\nAnd so today we're in uncovered seven trading rules help you manage your portfolio better here's the problem though\nThey're impossible to follow because of our psychology because of our own behaviors we do everything wrong because of our psychology so why\nThese trading rules will do is help you set aside the emotional components\nAnd help you focus on the risk management of your portfolio so you can be a better investor longer term now just because these are trading rules that doesn't mean that you have to be a traitor we're not talking about day trading where you're in stock today this minute next minute and out\nThis applies to even long term investors over time a lot of people that that I talked to was like I don't need to understand that I'm going to buy a whole ... I'm a I hold stuff\nVery long term and that's great so are we were long term investors but we manage risk along the way because we understand that eventually markets correcting if I lose principal\nThen I had to spend time making up my principal before I can start working on actually making money again getting back to even is not the same as making money so that can limit the downside risk by managing\nThe risking my portfolio well I can do better as a portfolio manager as an investor longer term so what's the ... take a look at the seven impossible trading rules and what we can do to ... to manage our money better\nThan the obvious ones to sell these are short letter writers run this is a common theme among many major and veterans ... that have invested money over long term and basically what it says is that if you have a position that it's not\nWorking will sell it because it doesn't mean that if you sell position as a law that you're a loser but that psychology what we think oh I Know I'm losing money on this if I sell it I have to admit that I was wrong well\nInvesting is like being married if you want to have been successful marriage just tell your wife you're wrong you will do better over time by doing that same thing comes to manage your money admit you're wrong and so you're losers what's your winters continue to operate\nA very basic good rule to follow as do more of what works and lots of what doesn't and you'll be a successful investor over time\nThe second rule is is my cheap and sell expensive that sounds easy but this is one of the hardest ruled ever to follow up just like number one it's hard to follow because well we don't want to sell when something losing money because we have to admit we're wrong\nSo we wind up holding it hoping it'll get back to even well same thing goes with buying cheap and selling expensive we want to buy value starts doing things that are under price because we buy value that means I'm going to have a better opportunity to make money in the future\nBut what we do instead is that we buy expensive and we sell when things are cheap we do things exactly the opposite because well\nWhen things are rising\nIf we do things exactly the opposite because well\nWhen things are rising and things are expensive well that's where we want to be invested in the markets so we buy stuff the overpriced we tried to come up with some excuse or metric as to why it's cheap it's time\nBut when things are truly cheap at the bottom of fair markets well we don't want to buy it because we think everything's going to zero\nSo again we have to understand that our psychology make just do everything exactly backwards we have to buy when things are the worst and we need to be able to sell when things are at their best and today things honestly can't get much better than they are today\nBut yet this is where people are wanting to jump into the markets and wanting to buy assets thinking things only go up for me or\nUm the odds of a future returns are much lower today than they were back in two thousand nine when things were actually cheat and this leads us to number three which this time is different the belief incident when markets are rising over time that they'll just keep on rising and we get to this point psychologically where there's very little fear in the markets\nPeople are concerned of a crash because it's been so long since we've seen one well obviously one is never going to happen again this time is never different\nValuations are elevated as we talked about a few minutes ago on our last segment with valuations elevated extensions at some of the highest levels in history some of the deviations from long term means at the long at the highest period in history\nThe odds of this time being different are basically Neal we're going to have a correction at some point and we're going to have a I lost a capital that we need to be prepared for this time is never different\nBe patient one of the biggest problems that people have in that thing is being patient being patient also means once I own something being patient to let my theory workout that doesn't mean being patient allowing a shock to go down twenty percent again if I have\nA purchase if I bought a position in my portfolio and it's not working it's not working for a reason I was wrong I Need to sell it and I need to move on and get my capital working opportunity costs is as big as the cost is actually losing money and an investment\nWe've got to keep our money working we want to make it work\nBe patient with your strategy and let it work hit the positions are working gifted strategy is working the patient and let it work sometimes a good strategy doesn't work all the time a hundred per cent\nSometimes a strategy by Francis now value is underperforming gross\nBut may be patient if you're a value investor be patient with your value strategy because eventually that rotation from growth back into value is going to be the case and generally when people give up on their strategy and move into whatever is working today that tends to be at the very last into the cycle\nThe other side of the coin is also being patient to wait just because you have cash that needs to be in that that doesn't mean that you need to invest it today\nOur job is an investor again is to buy cheap we need to buy value we need to buy opportunity where our ... our risk and reward or in our favor in terms of us making more money than we are potentially going to lose by making their votes might\nBe patient and allow that opportunity to come to you invest your capital because remember when you're being patient with your money you're saving money and what you don't want to do is destroy your savings by over buying an over paying for that at the wrong time\nNumber five turn off the television please turn off the television not to buy gas just a TV [noise]\nThe problem with TV is is that every day we're talking about markets are up to date because of this reasons markets are down today because of this reason\nTrump said this is the market did this a Europe did this whatever it is but every day it's a reason to buy or sell turning off the TV let you step away from the media driven psychology of markets helps you tame some your emotional quotient center out there some of those emotional behaviors that are driven\nBy media exposure turn off the television step away read study analyze your portfolio understand what you're invested in why you're investing that what you expected to do and understand what your strategy is\nThe TV only adds to the noise that potentially drives mostly bad behaviors overtime\nNumber six risk is not equal to return\nThis is the one of the biggest fallacies that people have when investing money the more risk I take them more money I Will make\nRisk is not a function of reward in other words you don't jump out of an airplane with no parachute and suspect that you're going to have a very good opportunity all the way down risk is a function of how much money you're going to lose when something goes wrong\nThe more risky take the more you're going to lose when something happens one of the biggest problems with an ongoing bull market that's a decade long and nature is is that people forget about what risk is\nI take on more and more risks because as markets continue to rise rising markets bull markets forgive me for my investing mistakes it covers up the things I Do wrong and the best thing over paying for assets buying poor quality company rising asset prices cover that up\nA venture really when you have the bear market all of those risk exposure you have a revealed very quickly\nRisk is not a function of reward risk is a function of loss and to always remember that and of course going against the heard you know the heard in other words the public is generally right in the middle of a market advance so you know from two thousand tens of two thousand sixteen them the herd was generally write\nYou know or a new product around the idea and and um you know we're not made it happen\nSo now the so the app access earth I ah it's it's live and functioning now correct yeah so I can go downloaded on apple or Android and ...\nAnd um become a act desserts users so why wouldn't want to do that I mean so again you you brought it to your point your your rock climbers so probably going somewhere and rock climbing all by herself is not a great idea\nUnless you're just truly a daredevil at heart and my son would probably do that but you know having a partners important so you know trying to find people that are also rock climbers and I guess I Would get say interesting skill level yup it is important right yeah\nSo you know specifically climbing it's it's really important to to connect with people that\nUm you know are at that same level because it can become dangerous if if they're not um you know so that's one of the key elements in our platform\nI'm allowed to use or to radiate rate themselves based on their on their skill ability um but it's not just for climbing I mean we have forty four sports\nI'm so far in the platform I'm you know and digital probably twelve on the next update and ... and you can continue to keep updating that um but you know the the main premise is\nI Want it to build something that would would would be a distraction from distractions and what I mean by that is is you know you get on Facebook you get on any of these other platforms today and it's\nIt's just that you're you're inundated with garbage over and over and over again and it it just became a place where I I didn't feel comfortable going on anymore\nAnd there's some studies out there that they want to treat people that get on Facebook now become depressed since that time spent so\nYou know I kind of noticed I Try not to look you know let's let's step away from that um and I must try to create a home\nUm where people can use are apt to get inspired you know maybe maybe you you're not a climber but you've always had the thought of trying it in the back of your mind and and you know we're on ... you can get on and see a picture of some guy climbing and say\nToday is going to be the day that I go out there um and then you also have the ability to connect with somebody because myself I never got into climbing just walking into a gym you know it took 'em in my friend's pushing me in and constantly calling me and say hey let's go do this and so if you're not connected in your social circle um you're not going to have that that\nThat motivating factor that that gets you outside and do it\nIt's a it's a it's a very interesting concept because you're you're right you know when we take a look at numerous studies it's not just one that you know there's a Thursday or thirty percent of people to use social media get depressed because\nEverybody else's life seems to be the greatest success in them but they've actually found out that\nYou know a very high percentage of the people that are posting are are actually depressed but it's also the fact that it's a social media creates a doping mean release and it's very addictive just as gambling is rock all ism is\nAnd one of the reasons that people spend so much time on social media to get that doping mean release yet which is you know he likes to get how many clicks Soviet\nSo yours is kind of an interesting concept it using the very thing that people are addicted to you to get them on addict and get them out of the house you know I yell at my kids you know get out of\nThe house you know we we were growing up or not you I'm older but when I was growing up it was like go outside sticking a ball there you go and and uh it's hard to get people to do that now that this happens going to try to change that yeah and\nAnd so you kind of touched on another point um which I think is really important to to to to go back on um we have the term in the famous right I'm sure you've heard of that were where everybody is fishing for that next like or are they share and and\nSo on our clock when we we eradicated that it's the best of ... we could um you can't see how many followers somebody else house um you know we're trying to eliminate that mentality um altogether\nUm we have a liking system where if you see a picture you can like you buy it by you know acting start but\nWe've debated on taking that out to um right now as a user base is small um you know I think he makes the most sense to leave it in because that's a form of connection so somebody you know reaches out or you know that that start to new possible relationship\nUm but yeah I mean that's pretty much a weekly conversation between me and my team like hey it's time to cut that thing or or rooted in right now um because we don't ... I mean we don't want to promote that\nThat um vanity or you know and and so we're trying to trying to get away from it then I I could\nAlso see the other side of that too not just from the vanity standpoint but you're wanting to promote a sports it's already dangerous and the one way that people tend to try to get in the famous has to do is to do something very dangerous and promoting and then of course you start potentially promoting dangerous\nUh habits yeah in ... sport which obviously you don't want to do so yeah\nBut when we come back for more than a quick break and come back on TALK a little bit more about the ... it's kind of an interesting idea that you're trying to create the social network for people that are in like sports\nUm I like to talk a little bit about the the the wealth building out aspect deserve it was like how you gonna make money out of the [laughter] part and parcel down the road here but uh we'll talk about that because you've actually been talking to somebody sees out in California into 'em before says as an I'm working on an\nApp to so I'm I'm right in St Louis joined the guy that I have time to raise the capital so uh we'll talk about that we come back from the brain power with Jeff long is the founder and CEO of access earthly right back after the break\nMore with them [noise]\n\nOne of the law her talk with Lance above your money request a personal one on one have lamb swab or show dot com\nA new professional version of real investment advice is coming but you can still subscribed today for free had really investment advice dot com and click on the R.

broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nNews how restraining radio you buy online training academy\nWelcome to the show was your first time let's there than we are pleased to meet you my name is Ryan and joining the as always I say as always for the last week he was out of time I mean literally you teaching in Texas\nI Would have changed dramatically Connecticut that's a long way from taxes I I was on the right country with a lot in the rye region facilities back with us today if you guys are with us last week we have John O'Donnell he's the chief now jobs\nAre we calling the rain maker hear it on my training academy filling in for Larry issues\nHere on the income generating jokes now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we just talk about making more money hence the name right now the income here it's all about driving more income now and always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than use things we have to do you know it's not our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spent a lot of time on the show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about she has a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approach and an hour me my consistent approach is the marks go down and said wait so we've got to\nHave a strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money off the honor sideways right now we've got that ball is biased where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having the student's focus on right now to generate money and do people identify look down opportunities and they'll side was opportunities\nWell it really comes down to two things it's about awareness and basically emotion right now so the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they say that making money it's working another job which is something we all want to do and where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again have five different income stream [noise]\nWell you can imagine a millionaire and I want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income or active income that just want to pay check coming in over and over again and so a lot of our students to learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that by following people who are already doing what you want to do and of course referring to the big bags and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways to make money is not just by going along where most people are in a trade that way but also\nHere's one one recent graduate had to say\nOn my training I had I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader better planner I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kid there is that it because I'm I'm available now we can eat together in a family um I get my trading nine and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visitors on line at Houston oh da dun calm that Houston O T H ...\n[noise] you are listening to power trading radio show\nWelcome back you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructed development and structure it on the trading hitting the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was ... on how to make money or the market's going up to our side how to generate more money to generate more income and consistent income no matter which\nWay the marketing going if whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nDon't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle was a little bit of a list of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income\nBut there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last ... in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their dreams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing the the commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and it's just something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in\nThey don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talked about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work\nAnd then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhen I talk to students about the biggest concern is right now is what we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question any more of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again which started to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people\nTo not have a situation happened to them again like it did before and I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah [noise] you know that's not be that's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions be back in January on the show and then it'll be fun to do another one that next January but one of the things\nThat we we went through every recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and one of them was like I Hope I work like you're their hope I work till the\nFurniture 'til the day I die and and another one where I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and and then and unfortunately those are those are reality that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small tweaks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars in it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had to\nYou know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me was on it but it is you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great re there's there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say that I'm Sorry for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us and the mere rant and really we've got to own that we got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my optical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle\nWhich just simply means changing similar habits and changing what we're doing a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces in that can help it generates more income found to have to class really spend a lot of time going through something step by step process as\nThey can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in\nSo one of the things we could do Larry if you're up for it as we get away somewhere ticket let's do it All right well right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stocks options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win it set a passes the one of the classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready including with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like\nHow to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency the much much more the professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight\nFive five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up\nBeing colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some fences there\nBut the most will streams of income topic is one that I Love Larry I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent type different streams of income from the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well\nWe're right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection we have the opportunity or we have the the access of generating these multiple streams of what are some of the what is the multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams of some of the passive type uh types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nGulf well before I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply adding some zeroes at the end of their income\nThey're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes in their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realize that they can be trading and it's just really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what do you try to attain\nBecause a lot of times you'll sit back that puts you at a time machine like let's say we put them back into the Laurie and right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's eight goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead and achieve those goals probably very few ... years from now what's going to make it any different that something will change instead\nWhat if you can learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have to call three hour traders they get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trade with it a couple of hours and they got their whole day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key is that I find\nIs that it really is about like we've mentioned freedom\nHow are you going to find a way to ease your time to lie to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have that prevent them from the company successful either financially or life\nIs fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down and simple way where students can figure for the first time\nHow banks make money and more importantly how they can make money too\nYeah and really procrastination ends up being the largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off of you you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nHas the customer we have to understand that what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on\nThat are aged in with the with the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's we're getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways that where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming\nUp in your area the happy classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kitten packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero four four four and you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston O. G. A. dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nWe've talked a lot about kind of a growing side of things with the retirement accounts really the getting those retirement comes to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money in the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts\nAnd what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight factor and speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts\nHow much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your save for retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement\nOnce you want to stay on the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting yourselves educated what I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible trying to win it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and\nYou don't see it right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from Youtube video and then go up to fly school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense for the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say the cavalry coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nOver and over I heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from the William ... credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is is you were talking about thirty percent can end up going the fees and there was an article I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spent three years of their life\nPaying for the feed so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWith great place to start that just started that educational process was out of one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now I've got a happy class coming up in your area and a half the class\nAs we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirements generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second you're gonna have a chance of winning set of ... one of these half day classes\nSo if you are driving the great time to pull over and get that phone ready\nNow included with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kittens packed with lessons from some of our top instructors my favorite thing about the professional insiders ... is it makes it so you can get started right now kind of a

are\nThat were part of that show with Skeeter will be a carrying it on his legacy and uh it's a sad thing that we lost him but um\nFive five eight five seven three eight pound ... a free\nCall on your horizons so I've been working on a pretty pretty good remodel its route and we didn't really remodel the pool we had to re plumbed the pool because of some issues that happened uh when they they added another building to this complex is is a\nThis is a retired or an assisted living retirement complex\nA over off ... and a founder an area that I've been working on for several months we've had some delays unfortunately but uh we actually had to\nJust tear up the deck and ... ... all of a swimming pool we added it's a huge symbol it's about sixty five thousand gallons and uh it's uh we put in twenty different returns we've got five different scammers we have two locations of a main drains\nThat are all connected and just lots and lots of water flow\nAh one of the things when you're working with a commercial pool that you have to do is you have to turn over that pool in a six hour period of time and what that means is that you have to pump enough water through the filtration system to where\nIf you started from ground zero at eight o'clock in the morning by two o'clock in the afternoon all the water in that swimming pool would have circulated through that filtration system and in order to do that on this size pool I had to come up with a hundred and sixty gallons a minute\nOr which is a lot of water\nA pumping through the system so in order to do that I got I got some help from a good friend Tom there's a good buddy of mine and we talked about him not not Tom from a a Texan pools my other friend Tom he um\nHe helped me with a hydraulics of this we used three inch pipe we used to and a half inch pipe we used to and ship up to the skimmers we used to a commercial size of the s a F ... from\nPenn tear which is a variable speed and variables a variable flow pump\nAnd uh you have to own a commercials situation you have to have like these little um flow meters so that you know you the the when you were inspected you can make sure that you're pumping enough water to work to do that to fix our turnover rate and um\nSo\nWe got it all going got plastered we've got the Tom cleaned up\nOh yeah that was another thing I was talking about when I talked about Dave I'm getting so so confused right now uh when you're dealing in simple remodel of your swimming pool\nYou know uh when you're dealing in simple remodel of your swimming pool than you know just cleaning the tile we have a beat blasting process now that cleans all fall that scale cleans off all that calcium buildup cleans up the ground makes it look like it did when it was brand new I'm not kidding you\nIt's unbelievable and we had to do that with this pool because really the pool had not been properly maintained\nUm that's where ... magic them a gym stuff really helps and that's really makes a difference so you really need to use something like that will talk about that little bit later anyway I\nI'm I'm getting sidetracked here but I was talking about how whenever you jump in your swimming pool no matter\nHow old you are you still feel like a kid you wouldn't believe\nAll these people that live in this assisted living home a community which is beautiful that'd be nice to have beautiful apartments and really a lot of nice people in these all these people are well let's just say they're older than me [laughter] and ... you would think their kids\nBecause they're all so excited about being able to get their swimming pool to get apparently what happened to the pool happened over two years ago and they haven't\nBeen able to use their swimming pool for all almost two years a little over two years\nSo it's like at a time I'll see if we can we get in the ... which excited tell us when we can get in the book and it just reminded me how how being in a swimming pool no matter how old you are makes you\nFeel like a kid again and I'm living it almost every day and ... those those people out of that assisted living a complex are really excited I I I got to get over there 'cause they're going to do like water aerobics and classes and stuff like that and they have heaters for the swimming pool\nSo that they do get can stay warm for the the later months you know when it gets a little bit chillier outside but uh\nI don't know I just wanted to share that story where the because I Love swimming pools I Love the way they they transform your backyard and if you have a pool\nAnd you you're having any kind of an issue with it give me a call to eight one five five eight five seven three eight or ... pounds K. F. C. V. is a free call on your varieties and one of the reasons that I wanted to do this backyard bay radio program\n'cause I'm not only wanted to share with you Mike Seidman about ... owning my own swimming pool and about how proud it makes me feel and how great it is for my family and my friends but\nBeing in this industry for over Thirty years now I can walk into someone's backyard who is so frustrated with their swimming pool they just want to get rid of it\nAnd you know it's usually something pretty simple that can be relatively easy to fix\nThat swine perjury to give me a call if you're feeling that way about your pool to eight one five five eight five to seven three eight pound K. and see the is you're free call on the horizon I'm One of the things that\nWe had to overcome with this big commercial pool I was just talking about and one of the reasons that I had to re plummet is that when it was originally plumbed it wasn't deficient in other words a it wasn't making that six hour turnover rate and it just wasn't filtering\nProperly\nAlgae was a huge issue\nEven though that their pumps were running twenty four hours a day they couldn't control algae because\nBecause they had so many dead spots in the pool that's why brushing it's so important in in in all your swimming pools because every every swimming pool has dead spots and even this pool after I've read Colombia with twenty different returns had still have some debt spots or you just can't avoid that\nUm but now with the proper kind of circulation we're not going to have any kind of issues with algae unless the pools just simply not maintained properly\nAnd as you will do pump filter water chemistry and your pool's going to look great you're pumps run in the end of hours a day to highlight to have your pool circulate enough the turnover at least twice a day now in a residential pool\nOr eight hours for a turnover rate is fine\nUm but\nOne like this this commercial pool when I got done and we got it all up and going we needed a hundred and eighty a hundred and sixty gallons a minute to get make that turnover rate would that ... we got a hundred and eighty gallons a minute\nYeah that's I mean that may not mean a lot to you your pool or in your backyard may be pumped eighty gallons a minute I'm not sure what kind of pump you have but unless you have the hydraulics\nSet up which probably most of you don't\nUh I Know a lot of builders today now are starting to go with the larger a plumbing like Cyprus custom pools for a great example they understand hydraulics they they get it they're going to do the bigger the piping in their forties so you'll have a better turnover rate and that's really what it's all about so\nI'm going around full circle you know all of these things are important for you to know because they're the underground stuff when you're when you're shopping a pool builder when you're shopping and remodel or because\nIf you have some basic questions you can ask them and let me tell you first of all you can always call me or email me\nAnd asked me questions even if I'm at work on your project 'cause I don't work all over Houston but I can I'm certainly more than happy to help you at least make sure you're asking the right questions and you're getting the right the answers so that year remodeled project goes well\nUm but\nMy point it's been saying all this kind of going back to the light conduit and the one inch conduit\nJust asked for it if somebody tells you they need to replace your light conduit just tell them I Want you to use one that you can't do it if they say oh well that's going to be a lot more money and say yeah I tell you what I'll be glad to go by the conduit for ya\nI'm not kidding you because it's not that much more money anyway okay I've been rambling I'm going to open the phone lines up to eight one\nFive five eight five seven three eight pound KFC the free call on you've arrived and I'm going to go ahead and take a short break we'll become ... we got the maintenance tip coming up and we got lots more I Want to talk about this week on remodeling your swimming pool and choosing\nA professional [noise]\nThat's the

that light through the Internet\nIf there's anything wrong with that light that hey you still got to pay us to install it\nAnd if something goes wrong with it in a couple of months is not us you got

than you did if you just went ahead and bought the light from an authorized even but\nWell I Know I Know we do have to work with it if we ever been afraid to spend a little bit more to do it right so
