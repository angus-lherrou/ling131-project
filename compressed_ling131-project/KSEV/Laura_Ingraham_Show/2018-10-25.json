one of my party courageous a mom still still has that frontier feeling oh the ... not very popular um say but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair\nAnd I think most people just that you know on some she obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just pulled up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing kept an eye but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a progress report then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing you know with the sound turned off and noticed his demeanor\nYou know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThan media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really\nHas driven people to just ... frenzy and fury enough that and and the left always take the too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics that people have a lot of theory there um\nAnd I as a leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and then say okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's gonna be Medicare for all and it's going to be health care for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressman and North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going into the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy [noise]\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and I you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is look\nLet's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad steaks at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies locked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life\nBut I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what a guy like Brett cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient and much less necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or month at a time by your thoughts on the packages arriving at the\nResidences or offices and some critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something different than than the reality that it that is behind it all and in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior and what contribution if any we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this lack of civility and uh without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nNow it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'll be the next senator from the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the whole country I haven't been to Congress and I got an\nEmail we I'd love to give you that opportunity perhaps for celebration or

I mean you can see the art of it's just easier at this point we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nMost illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force it's so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas\nWhere illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still\nFor low skilled black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under cut by people who\nPrefer to be paid in cash or we have fake Social Security numbers and African Americans are in other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four and I will tell you this is a rounded Santa is the only choice for Florida oh we're going to play the sound from a last\nNight's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek political\nFavors are political consideration which that should in of itself that should be disqualified any blaming rates of course for any question about his FX so we'll play the race card or a soundbite and more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\nThey were you know you bring it up is Andrew Gillum gets elected up with a ... that's that's just the first point but\nWhen it gets elected up without a leash Florida with like ... that's that's just the first point what\nJohn Case excited about all this or is he going to be down there at the border walking and people are taking them into is all\nThat if all those people are called the cheese steaks and they want to record of us without carrying flags while they are carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to the Americans do you want to come here to take what we have with it for us [noise]\nUm some excellent points now carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flag\nOr the Democrats and others have trouble\nOr ... why haven't authorities given up for information about what's in these packages that's a good question people\nAre asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs they were clearly what the timing and the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nPaint a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempt at terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserves information probably faster than we are getting at but I think they don't want to copy cats and\nSo forth so I understand that as well\nUh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma\nTheresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to share these are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly ask how much of your personal time in your personal many do you stand on humanitarian causes and helping their fellow man I have\nAll ideas it's not very much it's just that sound bite for them and they really have no care\nFor those that are around them they don't have the charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again\nIf you if people are willing to sponsor individuals who apply for legal\nOf entry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit as financially\nAccountable for them and also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up I mean we know they enforce\nTheir their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Kades has taken into his own uh his own you know governor it's a mansion and making sure you could take and it feels pretty nice house\nIt's a great point All right you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show a very tight race in Indiana\nAnd we're going to talk to Mike ... a bronze who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race for going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meaning a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course\nA should also not be a Republican strong conservatives\nAre and what what Indiana's think today\nAnd she felt the scores from Iraq excuse me for the Democrats are incumbents that it I think governor I'm so I have governor on my mind a so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race\nBut I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break eight five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the

record being fully flushed out a peer through this campaign and that's the reason we're going to win it with or without the capital you know Bob but uh just a lot of good thing to happen we\nAbout the capital you know bump but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we've resource competitively in great fundraising and not a whole lot different than executing a business plan and we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or in what what is your take on this side of the criticism and the president was almost instantly even though he condemned that's of course and asked for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these a package is being spent\nOn the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge rent for the main thing is that I'm the reason I'm running is\nA wouldn't be running a invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still re litigate again I think the two thousands sixteen race and that's why he gets credit for the great agenda that's out there that's a\nExciting who's yours and a popular and sixteen here among conservatives and even more so\nAnd I even think the people that maybe don't love it style are going to look at the results and uh I think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to\nBecome so Trump here when uh you know he'd ever um you know he's been allergies or with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than a given absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to the sun packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence towards saying for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after the release was almost killed\nAt the hands of aid rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened at that guy was inside of the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it to me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital here and he was in office challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative uh lives and distortions to\nSchumer is packed dump into George Soros and the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's a closed and ugly underbelly of what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold him accountable uh I think ah\nThe Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part\nThe point where our race changed and many others enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I saw something Fox dead on across the board and the negative advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nProposals to actually advance our economy or grow our prosperity earn forced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to\nPersonal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump dealing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure you know be portable CARE Act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because he had big government hooked up with big health care is specifically insurance and I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd law upheld premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was\nMade of consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the south of talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and spent\nA career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progress the result the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on its heels and constantly apologizing ... that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John ... forever back on the heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and then I I think it's a little\nLong since pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWow I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an at large thing you're going to get\nIs is a gender really heals then uh I talk about tax reform but I Do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners now that you've got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them plot for ten years and I've preached out all the time but you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we've got ten months people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us\nThat ... gone out there and towel to tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employs people quit looking through the false hope of a federal government if the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put us on the brink of\nA financial calamity if we don't get more people in there they're going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going you know there'll be more obvious but I think the jump on that bandwagon sick our necks out and\nJoin the uh you know Trump trained so\nUh what will happen well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this rates are the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience and Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls vote for an advanced ... and ... and America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass illegal immigration gotta deal with it for the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike round with these fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're going to win that's my and I'm I'm so glad we're in we're going to win\nIt than that I'm looking forward to it and the Laura thanks for the support and we're going to finish a heart end of the a tape on the sex and uh I Can't wait to be a reinforcement for\nTape

probably going to be close to sixty where you were in the mid forties\nThere are some exceptions but that's typical\nIf you say I want to be a top one percent wage earner how much do they make that also hits the top around age forty five so someone is forty five years old during the top one percent you make about four hundred and fifty thousand a year\nAnd a six feet you make about forty and fifty grand a year so it really levels off around four fifty you get to four hundred and fifty grand you're going to be in the top one percent\nWhat about by age\nWhen you're twenty five if you make a

talked about that forever some people said you know oil go away we won't have enough of it that was called peek production will\nNow then we keep making more and more funding more and more oil so now the question is what about pique predicts them not a peak when we'll have it but if people will lead it\nBP said that there will be a time of the two thousand forties\nWhere the demand for oil will peak and then start to decline\nAnd there's some European countries now that said look there'll be a crime in the near future where every cars electric shaver on just not see a peek a bit of an for

valve and um [noise] doctor saved your wife is open heart surgery which is the night saying\nThe problem is this life threatening heart infection was because she didn't inject yourself with drugs that caused that had bacteria that causes her to need a heart valve replaced\nSo taxpayers paid for it they saved her life but she'd done it herself\nBut they said to her hey if you do this again and you take the drugs that affect his heart valve we're not going to replace it does that make sense to you I bet you're sitting there nodding your head\nSo it really kind of makes it makes sense to me we want to help people save lives in somewhat arts themself over and over do you keep spending your money to fix it\nBut what if they smoke one of the overweight what if they don't exercise or what if

really the big thing trying to figure things out for us how would that work on Wall street\nWell the most simple fashion if you have an account and every year in March you call up for tax statements that would remember that it'd be sure let you know if you have certain types of stocks to get reports on those automatically if you ever use oil and gas you'd probably get an email on that\nBut the

should make her life easier I beginning TST out of college and that makes\nRewritten again three hundred thousand dollars a year I've had a lot of fun\nWith um someone I Know whose daughter got married they said a hundred thousand all the wedding because they sent me the budget right because I always think it's interesting to see other people spend their money and I cheer civil those numbers with you\nSo I found it interesting recently I read the average cost avoiding is about thirty thousand my wedding was um about twelve so yeah not a lot going on there um\n[noise] the average cost of a honeymoon is about five thousand dollars\nThey'll let's talk about the hundred thousand dollar wedding budget because it certainly bears repeating once in a while because I find it fascinating and and um my daughter's got Mary did not fit a hundred thousand I had to weddings in one year um here's what I learned at the wedding\nSaved the day cards wedding invitations they can be cheap or they can be expensive\nMost people want it heavy if it's heavy it's expensive and it and maybe I've turned into a bit of a snob of not being judgmental I'm just intellectually curious but when I get an wedding invitation now I hold the paper in my hand to go visit heavy is it like\nIt a hundred thousand dollar wedding budget to save the day cards were\nFour hundred and sixty two dollars the postage fifty six box save that date envelope calligraphy and this was for two hundred and fifty just two hundred the imitations were Nineteen hundred is that crazy\nNow the imitations were Nineteen hundred they sent out a hundred and twenty five two hundred and fifty people two hundred and twenty five couples that since I run math\nOn my Hewlett Packard twelve see calculator ongoing hold on if you spent a hundred thousand dollars for two hundred and fifty people four hundred dollars a person that's eight hundred dollars a couple\nSo I Know the flu and family and their friends and their daughter got engaged and I was talking to the dad about the wedding\nAnd I told him about this hundred thousand our wedding budget\nAnd he goes why how he goes man ego Steve my wife and daughter going to go crazy it could be a high could be said I could do that you might end up doing that I said look if you'd like two hundred and fifty people is eight hundred bucks a couple\nAnd then he got quiet and he goes yeah you're right because that's crazy I said well what do you favor\nYou send me five hundred bucks and I'll stay home I'll keep my walk home with me I Will come I said so here are your options if you're going to do this really expensive whether it's an eight hundred a couple that means you're that's an eight hundred bucks for me and my wife to go\nAnd you send me five hundred I stay home you'd say three hundred\nAnd um but he didn't take the deal so I guess I got a wedding invitation coming [noise] the average cost of anybody's five thousand dollars and something that's changing\nIs that
