order to turn these things catch them early and turn them around if we can uh you know if it's if they're staying with us and moving through the process as they should you know we asked them to call us every step of the way and\nYou know communicate with us and tell us what they're doing and when they do that we can catch things up front as they start to do them but\nIt's also more things that you observe that people tend to do\nThat you know that\nReally prevents them from maximizing cash flow from you don't catch it\nRight or all of a few things that are covered goes wrong at the
