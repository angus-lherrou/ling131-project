live your life\nThen I'm going to go into the moral based\nLimitations to those belief systems\nAnd why people don't want you to actually live in the better forms of lifestyles let's talk\nFirst about what the three different types of lifestyles are the first one is dependent and that's what most people living there was an independent world um they're dependent on everybody else to dictate for them what their morals are dictate for that what what is important in their life\nTo dictate what they do when they do it who they do it with\nAnd understand that people live in varying amounts of dependency\nSome people wife of quiet desperation is massively desperate\nSome people have just a small ... maybe everything in your life but I'm pretty good except one part of your life maybe you're struggling with a ... a marriage maybe you're struggling with some kids that uh you know you raised in a way that didn't turn out the way you wanted to be or maybe you're you're struggling with some some health issues\nUm maybe we're struggling some financial issues there's all these different things in life\nThat a revolving around you\nBut your results are directly related not to what the world gives do you work with but what you do with what the world gives you you know love is with opportunity meets preparation\nGives you you know luck is with opportunity meets preparation\nThere is no such thing as a lot of other than you being prepared for the right thing to happen searching it out and letting it happen in your life but you have to do that but to do that you have to have a different way of thinking and most people believe\nThat they do not have control of their lives now there's an interesting argument here as I said and think about this\nAnd I'm doing this live you have to realize I'm just I'm Talking about the top of my head but one of the things that gets me a lot of people think they're free\nYet if you ask them why don't we go do this today's uh well I got

can't get\nOut of the lifestyle cold dependency\nWe're talking about how you could work your way for independence she independent see and then the ultimate goal is to go from\nBeing independent to be able to be independent ninja tendencies when two people that are absolutely\nNot dependent on each other decide to get together and produce something that's even better than either one of the produce but neither one of them has control manipulation of the other person it just it is that rare opportunity we're combined\nUm action is stronger than a senor person trying to accomplish something so you can bring groups of people together that have different skill sets and things as long\nAs they don't all as long as\nThey're not all dominated by one person over there is one protein folding their view is everything than that is not in our dependency that is dependency all over again so you have to be independent before you could ever limited interdependent lifestyle but today we're focusing on\nHow do you become independent and I think the first thing you got to do is you got to stop making decisions based on more rules because everybody's morals are different\nAnd you have to start making decisions based on\nUm the bully of\nWhat I'm about to do is effective or is it affect your most interesting thing\nWhen you don't understand when you first look at this theory is that many morals are based on effectiveness you know don't covered by neighbors what comes to come over and kill ya\nIs a pretty active beliefs of the rights do steel by neighbors food you come over and kill ya there's there's there's some belief systems out there some morels out there that are based Shibley and survival and when you start\nUp there that are based sibling survival and when you start looking at these things you say should I Do this yes or no the answer comes down to what will the ramifications and repercussions be on the line\nAnd we'll be hurting you or someone else so the question is do you believe you're hurting somebody\nAnd if you're a Democrat you believe welfare it's helping people if you're a Republican you believe welfare is turning people into slaves is leaving them to the government control so you were bullied about whether or not something is effective or ineffective is also going to be\nCharged with the fact that you want to look at it from your partisan point of view so I tried to take the hardest for this amount of almost everything I Do and just look at and say they're working or not working\nSo well I did that I have this test I give people take these five things that are important in your life and put them in the order of priority\nAnd what I've found is you can tell where people will fail they will fail wherever they're priority is highest isn't that interesting not where it's the lowest but where it's the highest because they will focus so much on that that everything else will end up suffering\nSo I had to come up with a set of priorities for my life\nAnd directly related to those priorities as you look at the are the result of my life so I'll go through your mind just to share them with you you know the old I'll show your mind if you show me your kind of concept and we'll see where they may be my first priority was health and fitness because those two hundred thousand fourth grade\nI got no love notes action no friendship God no results I got picked for no teams I was overlooked for everything that went on\nI was unhealthy I was happy I did love myself because I didn't love myself I could love other people as soon as I became healthy and fit all of a sudden I became part of the beautiful people all of a sudden like they did with everybody else all this and that people want to be around me I wanted to be around them and because I Love myself I'd love to get\nBack to other people now if I have no health but I'm getting older now\nYou have no health how many people could help I Can't even help myself now I'm dependent other people for me so the first thing I Need to be as healthy enough to be independent so health physical support the next one on my list was money\nWhy money not because money for the sake of money\nBut money because you have to support your family your church your taxes your government everything costs money eat food transportation but more importantly because money is a scorecard of life\nI Believe you're helping of other people in this world get what they want you to that whatever you want like so how do you keep score that you're helping it up other people people tell me all the time do that's why I'm somebody once I'm not rich ones is not enough\nYou will have to help thousands and thousands of people\nAnd when you do that you get massive results financially the scorecard will come and you will be a widower financially because why because you helped a lot of other people in this world get what they need\nThat child a scorecard works so if you're not wealthy right now you're not helping

D. let's go to auto who's been patiently holding auto thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nHey guys you know you're saying that anybody that does include them bio is is that it will create and I do agree with you on both sides\nUh if you do know that violence you're being a hypocrite you know on a drawn out affair and it's like\n... what do you I promise you were a real feat I beat the crap out of you if you do out of the failure record don't worry about it I like the point you in the face I mean I can go on and on and no no no\nNo no you know he went back hold on on um hold on glass auto auto hold on a plastic bottle hold on\nYou do know he came back and he said absolutely apologized to those statements you said it wasn't right and he doesn't condemn violence on anyone you do know he said that right\nYes and I I I was so surprised and I raised that agreement to McCain or the Raleigh that many times when you out and we all that understand you know that we can agree to disagree I mean I don't like drunk like drunk I'm going to follow your own deal you\nKnow I mean I'm with you I mean\nWe we we are we're we're all ... vote on on our choice to go vote\nWell in in your ...\nFirst of all ... we thought it was first of all you're absolutely right I agree with you we're supposed to respect and whether you and I agree on something when we're done I Want to shake hands and be friends in because this is America this ... this is we're supposed to be a better place\nBut the problem was going back to that it ... your perspective is important when we talked about Donald Trump said\nHe said when that when that what's happening there was a paid agitator at one of his rallies like punched that guy in the mouth he absolutely said he has to pay their bills and then somebody did it he immediately didn't want anyone no no no I didn't really mean that don't punch anyone don't attack anyone don't do this I condemn violence\nHe absolutely did that the point I'm making is let's go back to Hillary Clinton she said we can't have civility until they're back in charge has Maxine Waters backed off and never statements encouraging mobs of people to go around people and tell them they're not welcome in this country anytime anywhere\nAnd Eric Holder condemned his statements we're not seeing any condemnation from one particular side which leads to the problem of what you just said\nIt's going to be very difficult to go and get along with somebody who believes that well it's okay to get groups of people to follow you home and shout at you and in a in a mob that's dangerous I Do you agree\nUh I agree with you partially true you know the damage you dawn on me is not true you can go on to watch you know Google in a saying Trump beside the violence is over and over and over eating some idiot goes with them you know if you\nGet when you're saying you have ... and clearly if Sanders thought what you're saying is clearly it was Bernie Sanders fault that guy tried to murder those Republicans and damn near killed these ... his fault\nNo no because he never said I Know the crap out of the game I like the ocean in the face a you know forget about driving we mean by that which I Know you put up these he's like like no drop out or eating with you I promise you on\nAuto I just told you he already he went back and it's interesting\nI told you he went back in condemned those statements does that not count do you not believing apologies in other words nothing he if you want to know why people can't get along I don't know you just proved it thank you for the call you just proved that no matter what Donald Trump says or does he made a mistake\nIt doesn't matter he's evil he's wrong and there's nothing fixing it you didn't say one word about Hillary Clinton you didn't say one word about Maxine Waters you didn't say one word about any of these other people you want to know why people get along auto that is the reason why\nYou can't totally into my program expecting you to bend over and just let you say what you want factual or not I have already gone over on this program absolutely Donald Trump said that immediately send it didn't say my God I'm Sorry I don't do this and he said every other rally\nAfterwards in fact we learned later that the Democratic party was paying those people to not only attack Trump supporters to commit violence at these rallies you want to know because it it\nTrump supporters to commit violence at these rallies\nYou want to do because it it happened previously over and over and over again at his rallies\nSo we responded because he wasn't prepared wrong it was and he immediately admitted it Hillary Clinton has never admitted that it's wrong to say you can't be civil with someone to were back in charge there totalitarian it is their political ideology\nThat is why we have the problem auto using like a really nice guy but clearly you were one sided you can't get along with Donald Trump I talked about the state when he made over twelve years ago grabbing women by the\nWhat was pulled on a hot in mind that he didn't know he was being recorded and he never said that he did it he said that if you're rich women will let you do anything context it's important to grab you by to\nAbsolutely he said it you know what else he did when it came out he apologized said it was wrong it was a locker room talk and he was doing goofy stuff that you guys do he was in front of a crowd and he was performing\nBut it's okay to the others\nThat when they go do it well no they don't even have to say there's sorry it's all Trump's fault this is the narrative the media wants you to believe auto that's why and I've done is more research clearly then you have let's go to Rob who's been hanging out a long time Rob banks were hanging out of all the little boys from Texas\nWhere are we\nGoing to go to Mexico and serve\nAre seeking asylum sort of first country they enter so if they're from country to Mexico where are those should be returned to Mexico because that's what it was supposed to ... am I right\nUm I think technically you're right but Rob unfortunately these people don't follow along the otherwise they would go to the U.S embassy or they would go to the border where you the the station at the border where you apply for asylum but do they don't care if they're willing to come directly and they don't care about laws laws don't matter you're absolutely right\nI was a ... to ... you\nKnow there is no law that requires him to bring people and that is false from the news the fake news if you will\nTurn around and ... on border\nPatrol does it every single day in our country who tunes of thousands we can send the military to our border and we can say guess what you're trying to invade our country you are not welcome here you're not applying for asylum if you want to apply for asylum set right on over there station and they'll talk to you and you can go do that\nSo but what's happening is you got these lessons in the media and by the way I Know it sound like an animated that was yelling at auto earlier I was an auto sounds like a really nice guy he's just blinded by the media\nHe's been brainwashed to believe everything they tell them to believe so it was an attack but back to the point Rob yes he can send troops to the border of the national guard we can say you're not welcome no you can't come across\nAnd make them apply for asylum and if they if they're granted asylum then they can come in and they got to get that these people clearly there skating poverty not tyranny big\nDifference that does not qualify for asylum recalls you guys doing a great job averages let's go take a break and we'll be back with more precise radio if you want to jump solid and join in on the conversation on five ha and see me the way he won five five eighty five seven three [noise]\nRadio\nI Am Kim slipped back Hi Maria struck back and we are here to

appreciate it\nThe seven days a week on to on twenty four hour news channels and on social media thank you for the call appreciate it let's go to Judy Judy thinks we're hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nThank you love your show of course I'm you know I to me it's so obvious when you look back at the election when Hillary Clinton lost she was thoroughly thoroughly upset about it and I I noticed all of this name calling and you\nKnow all the back and forth and all the ... trend hate and and all of that really started I mean in my eye it looks like they're really bad loser\nWill and Judy holes and let you finish but you're absolutely right the rhetoric went up about twelve notches when she lost because it was it was supposed to be rigged in her favor and she lost she couldn't even speak to the people that showed up for her that night and then go back and then what happened she became the leader of quote\nThe resistance their term not hers she's gone in ... President Trump or racist whatever instead of conceding\nA nice thing quietly and going away like you're supposed to know that's not what she did she's the leader of the resistance and that rhetoric trickled down from the top and they say and so you're absolutely right it went up twelve nachos and it hasn't column down it's only gotten worse\nYou know another thing I wanted to point out in my opinion as well is that you know try being or what I Would call a real man look when you make a mistake you miss say something or you you said it wrong you know it it it even has a a character\nA within yourself that you can say hey I made a mistake you know that speaks\nVolumes to me it really that I Wish\nPeople would just okay but as far as I'm concerned nobody's listening to them\nI mean when you look like they're twelve years old you know ... and they're having a fit and the store because their model what lines and candy and ...\n... your Judy thank you really call you're ... you're absolutely right they're acting like pet you with children but the problem is there are people that tend to agree with them already absolutely will go ride along with them because they feel just a slight did Hillary Clinton was supposed to be our president I play the audio thousand times and the reason I'm not going to play right now she's got a bunch of calls when they get through\nBut they they everyone in the media thought there's no way this guy's going to win and then he won and they can't handle it they can't accept it so they're trying to do everything they can undermine him to cut his legs out from under him and to impeach him they said it they need it let's go to Marie in Houston I'm rethink for hanging on one of them is the most from Texas\nI guess I just said ... thank you to that than that you had on that was talking about how the people treat him I thought about him and I thought about Paul Ryan and all the others and I just kept saying he's right right right well I don't know he was but he made my day\nWas will I think it was really difficult to know do I say I mean not really it was Sammy sorry\nOkay probably a call ... ... children\nAre anywhere from eight

two weeks before the midterms while the early voting going on the fact that now one of them exploded which is a good thing\nIf we're going to find out other real bombs are probably not we're going to

I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about\nSomething that I think it's a very important it's it's very important to us but I'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply it in your life\nI'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen is that um you know I think that you're financially you'll be successful but I also think it will be successful in life\nAnd so the same kind of things that it takes to have a successful business as a successful financial advisory firm I think are the same sort of things that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm gonna apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this ... you are the most important person in the entire world so I mentioned in the previous segment we ... we not work with or a thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you've got grandparents children grandchildren\nAnd in some cases great grandchildren it really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do in your\nHow can we keep money matters and during\nA would be irresponsible of of us you know with regard to our clients and and their family so we we how we combination one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are what we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brands that doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do with your values [noise] so in your family it it would be the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera\nThis is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life\nAnd if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera\nSo this segment is you are the most important person in the world so we have to core value that applied that number two and number four is a core value number too sad that our clients benefit before when you do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless\nIf everything you do is geared around helping others\nThat what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works just this magic that happens it sometimes it's called Carla [noise] sometimes it's called the golden rule it it's there it's a ... what reaping and sewing I mean the religion to talk about it all the time [noise]\nAnd ... if you focus entirely on ... those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had it because that's our philosophy that's how we live\nSo that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meetings that we have with our senior financial ah partners are our senior partners where we talk about strategy and we talk about uh you know what we're going to do with given market conditions and all those kind of thing\nAnd in that meeting we had a chair is an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we say we want to imagine that a client is sitting in that room with us while we're having its meaning\nAnd we always used that as a litmus test that client sitting in that room with us with day approve of what we're saying and this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we like a comedy or we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo that's kind of goes to you know behave as if somebody's watching you all the time they have as if what you're doing is is is impacting others because when you started looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming ... you close up and you close up\nOpening to all the opportunities that are out there for you [noise] core value number four says if a client calls us we live\nAnd what I mean by that is is that\nIf people rely on you you know you have to think of yourself as they serve it\nYou know we feel like when you work for everybody you know I'm a CEO of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works that are from I'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job that that that they can I worked for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss [noise]\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we have a client called us we lost what I mean by that is that if a client calls about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or there's something going on in the markets or anything that client wouldn't holler about we shouldn't be a head of that we should be pro active\nLeak communicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call it so therefore if a client calls that's we law now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right they moved [noise]\nOr you know there's a change in their life or something happened in those situations obviously a client called us we didn't lose anything that we should have told them first we did lose\nOptical firmly do apply but we were when we create [noise] uh and uh we uh would like to work with you if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon so this is you than that so\n[noise]

I can do to avoid the mayor market in the questions are on your mind it's time to get some answers letters show you how to protect and maximize your retirement savings learn how the mud hole and sell strategy can help you minimizing bear market declines and find out how money matters can help give you financial\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talked about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're doing their financial work for you had a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is it something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want that happen in your financial advisory firm die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are that if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do therefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with\nAre there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is of values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure overtime regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over the course of the time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients who want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you would you Bill we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money ... you can invest in you know think of bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down if you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking looking at I make twenty five percent and then the whole thing last\nThen you can eat down you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually salad that's when you realize the value that you created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is of value so therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAre we have ten core values and I want to share with you core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because the risk is not your friend\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend\nOkay people who take high risks you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they have the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan gr so what we tell us what we tell people in fact we say that that are that are in that if if the goal is to make the highest returns possible then here's what I recommend\nSell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turn it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcases full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red\nOkay we're big that now if we hit or going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returned Vegas awaits\nBut somewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting it all on red lights how much risk you should take and our goal\nPhilosophically in life and I think your goal in life should be the same thing in take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your goals\nThe necessary to accomplish your goals\nYou [laughter] well I Love you that because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what what you're doing their you know the market has a way it it it you're you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with Michael Douglas rates of greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way a spanking greedy people bottoms bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a bad wound you don't want that that's not a pretty sight okay you don't want bright red chicks so take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that it's necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish recalls\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent and the risks that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk as it's necessary to accomplish hurdles\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I Want to tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors\nUm or you'd like to
