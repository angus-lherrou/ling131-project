I'm you know voting for the economy I'm a Trump supporter I'm voting for the economy safety other rule of law ... the only thing I think that happens but the president in New York so I I get it's coming from queens and so I'm pretty loud and beauty folded up on all of that and and how we can go off on a tangent\nBut I think sometimes at the rallies I sometimes I Would like to see the president you know drop the fake news thing drop the Pocahontas thing he's got so many good things in his corner or in his in his two years\nWhen there's a lot of people tune it when he's on the air is they want to see what he's got to say or whatever and I get how your rally the troops and all of that but the independence some of the Democrats that may not be happy with a party\nIf he would uh you know show what he's been doing I think his numbers were come up I think he could people and and change some of that perception because money goes to live\nYou know and a little bit less of the name calling and stuff like I said I Know that rallies the troops but but you got such a good record you know with the economy and the stock things that you were talking about you know you keep pushing that you get some people that lightly turn in may say ... you know what\nThings are you know this guy's right you know I look on line and the stock market you know like just go like sometimes they have the flag the high which is good we got to play ... sometimes some kind of a southern thing with things that you know accomplishments\nThat that he's heard didn't not just the Supreme Court stuff and and the big news\nAt some of the little things that affect business I Will say though here in Connecticut I'm In the marketing business yeah things are a little lost that share a lot of the guys that I work with it's not as you hear the economic numbers\nAnd we would think that we would be a roaring over here but it's a little you know it's sluggish as I say they're paying to learn it right here in Connecticut now it could be\nCould be Connecticut right a hole in the economy and yet ... says whatever but\nUm we thought a lot of us when we look at the economic numbers this or we figured it's got it you know real writing to us because when construction is going you know home improvement windows dishwashers for modeling kitchens bathrooms when we're rolling then you know the economy is really rolling right or is that right\nNow it's a ... I think there are some industries lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I\n... and here's the thing that I Would say and it you're right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruises or if you will and start being the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time see there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effect of this and need to know that ... am he's doing everything he can\nBe the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't six everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that people want from a president our security and prosperity and prosperity is best gain by\nHaving an even playing field where you're not owners fully taxed or regulated out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about and I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on\nA journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nUm but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia there are rogue regimes all over the damn morals Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nAnd I know due process their due process is we'll let what side do you want to be rolled civil\nWar and from my understanding as well as the the Germans wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah or domestic Saudi Arabia in politics problems that would be bent the by the U.S does not have any interest in knowing these women\nYeah well it certainly does it's beyond the president's ... of the capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I ... I can prove it to you\nAt MSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalist or that may have been mutilated\nDismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in that story and it doesn't change one American lives and it doesn't affect our policy with presidency in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we did take a

I had to squeeze the Notre Dame singing and\nContrast it with my beloved NYU [noise] you know you are bad lighting Irish in college football it rarely saw well you're the fighting Irish and we're the pansies I think they have little violets divide the bobcat so I think they were they had bobcat but all the all the posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so\nWe we ... we call them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms math\nOr when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does I think it's a great question um you know basically that air ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN had a poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that showed that why what you're seeing is that in almost all the polling data error rate now that's a that's a common thread that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because their car and a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republican\nOr an advocate close election they get a better idea who's actually going to vote or never raining in mid term it's like you know roughly forty five percent of the vote so attorney actually going to vote if that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll\nThat has Democrats up three in the toss up districts now if you're only up three and a tossup districts that within the margin of error and in the trunk out a way around I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a one to give up to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed is clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to know I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the ... office treatment capping off I voted for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent though they're not going to get picked up and all\nI think it's absolutely a dynamic could do that as an Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was it two thousand six teams there's a lot of Democrats are we looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out right now at fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a social\nCredit already shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like Ocasio Cortez et cetera or it's really wake eat a lot of people at a normal folks countries say maybe I'll vote\nYeah and I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a above the statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people yeah according mental that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to in Florida matter I thought she was going to kill being or coming up you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nA that's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge terminal tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that lie to ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic that our president would stand by a nominee like at the end it's historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country it's aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's national eyes that can erupt Trump\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about ... Republicans to come in because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nBut voters that difference that down south but the one guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise of politics and that's a good thing\nIs is a reality that Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't compete\nAnd there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though man should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're gonna start persecuting people like my wife worked out so they're going to go after every White House staffer they can they're going to try to break out of their age this whole idea of ... that take it over the Democratic party will turn out to\nGavel power house and it'll all be about to get air quotes corruption corruption and everybody that associates themselves with Trump they're going to try the same strategy\nHitler's try which Donald Trump is agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our website already I Do not

be higher than that I actually many of these races like Claire McCaskill in Montana West Virginia when Joe Manchin I think the Democrats\nAre totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great at

Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that as a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly\nYou there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go and never see a black person never see Hispanic say in some of these restaurants to eat it at the northern Virginia for whatever reason it cars up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided lives separate lot not a New Orleans we're side by side we share a music would share food we enjoy each other's company would drink together we have fun together with Mardi Gras together um\nAnd you hear a lot when you're in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you\nI think there's a lot of disgruntled men out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nAnd the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're gonna run against joblessness\nYou're going to run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you want you want and that's why I think Trump nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of its Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think the Democrats not love them but they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't I'm afraid we're capping off a judge Kavanaugh report because you can see\nFor a while I'm there and it's that great and we can go back that you're say for a while and\nSo we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I get points and I think you know to to to too many ... the Supreme Court has become the holy of hold as it is almost a high church to to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change\nAnd deprived of it they feel they somehow law something that's era treatable so this was a major blow even though a Brett Kavanaugh's at down the middle of the road straight down the middle ... she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round\nConfirmation hearings when Ruth

cooler months we say get it done now because it'll be easier on Tom Cruise 'cause it's not as hot you'll be able to get scheduled and why didn't bill save more money in the cooler months on the actual install itself and then when it's hot you don't have to worry about it\nExactly know what it is cool and out so\nActually we probably have a little less panicky customers so it it's actually better cause then when we come out to do an evaluation on the addict and there's a lot of some of those little things that need to be done a\nYou know just kind of things that need to be taken care of an address and yet it we can do that when it's cooler we can spend more time and the addict\nIn the summer I hate to say that you get in a hurry but you can only spent so many hours in that kind of ... especially once it gets passed about one or two o'clock in the afternoon there's just too hot so we can do actually less jobs in the summer that we can in the winter so things better this time of year

eight nine one more time to wait one three nine seven three seven\nEight nine we talked about adding insulation in the first segment Tom\nIt's important I Would I Would say that if you have to have that at work done and you're deficient in insulation I Would probably have that done first\nUnless you have absolutely no ventilation but chances are you have some um and then I'd probably do radiant barrier last depending upon fire trees or other buildings that were shadow in my house\nYeah I'm here thought yeah every house a little different um insulation definitely almost every house that we do we add insulation are a lot of wind you know will will go on wet inflation will put a couple of solar fans in and maybe had a radio ... all all at once just depends on the house we just did a house on yesterday\nAnd it was a removal and with your new a new insulation Scott all the old inflation so offended but they already had a right to read uber so in that case they didn't really think and they really didn't even need the radio that they had it wasn't really given them the value because it was there's a lot of trees over the roof\nOf soda and a case like that if they hadn't had writing but I wouldn't have recommended it because it was like over in king would and was covered in trees\nSo inflation made way more sense you're going to get a lot of bang for money quick return on investment I always tell people I kind of giving realistic expectations so I'm not going to say well you put a solar fan and it got to pay for itself in three months\nIs probably not the case it might be a year or depending on the on the attic temperatures and what's going on and maybe a three year pay back and then I let them make the decision which way they want to go because some people will say well you know through your pay but that's pretty good at thirty three percent on my money that's not bad\nPlus you get the tax credit which things certain things so we kind of go over all that when we come out and we do the analysis and that's really the best place to start when you're doing looking at doing an addict is take a look at it let an expert look at it and see what you actually need\n'cause a lot of times you don't just need everything just like taking your car into to shop and doesn't necessarily need breaks in the battery and a new windshield and new tires and it doesn't need everything and maybe it maybe doesn't he decided tires\nBut you have in my car if you haven't seen yet [laughter] I've heard of they're trying to allow you everything maybe you know it's New Year's old maybe you might want to go somewhere else get a second opinion so we don't do that will look at the addict and see what it actually needs but um and then the radiant barrier you know if it's exposed to the sun\nAnd you've got dark shingles and all that you definitely need to get black roof yeah yeah of course you need a rainy barrier\nYeah you know if you if you can let you want to do that but if you don't have any inflation and then I Would still leaning more let's start with the inflation if you're only going to want to have like if it's not a real big house like well let's just do what we do at the same time because most of our projects we can do within a day or\nDoesn't take too long usually a couple of hours per function so for doing insulation figure a couple of hours right in a couple of hours so usually most people they want to take a day off of work to actually do the work we can do it all in one day and we also do Saturday appointments and do installed on Saturdays as well\nFifty percent off certain he'd blown installations today here on the chicken for radio show from my friend Tom decker addict innovations he'll put an eight inch ad and on top of what you have it makes a huge difference he did it in my home I Love it I've got three different addicts as well\nUh ordinarily a dollar Ninety a square foot only Ninety five cents six\nHollers can get it however three of already gotten it\nYes yes so we'll have been so basically when they call will come out will do the attic analysis enough they liked it then you ... them will honor that price for that so I've had a few people call me or I'll get out there and I says oh I I was one of the first callers I thought I was getting a whole house full of free insulation it's like\nNo it's a free addict analysis ... something sure where everybody because we're in the last three or straightforward it's a free analysis will come out and look at it and see what you need and then we'll give you fifty percent off the whatever inflation if that's what you need it if you needed maybe don't need it maybe maybe a solar panel would be a better option so that's really the chemical might look at it and then we'll go from there that's the best thing to do okay\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine only three more callers can get the deal and before we move into radium barrier and solar addict fans I Want to just finish this deal to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if this is something you'd think that you want to have done within the next\nFour six eight we call now or something you want to have done next year leave the phones open for people who really wanted to get Tom can only get the deal with it so many people\nYeah whenever we get that too sometimes some will get people like oh I get out there like oh we're going to do something we are thinking like maybe two years Russia going out of the country for six months I Will call me in six months because you know some of the good even changed over the six maybe it's like what they decide well now we're going to sell the house and\nWell now we just want to bring it up to maybe in our thirties just to pass minimum building till we don't want to do the are thirty eight so kind of you know do it when you're ready if it to me there's no time like the president so if you're thinking about doing insulation and he's thinking well maybe in two years we're going to sell the house\nWell when you sell it they're going to do a home inspection and they're they're going to look at the inflation and if it doesn't meet building code that's got to come up on the inspection report is insufficient insulation and somebody's gonna want you to pay for it\nSo if you're doing out in the two years it could pay for itself in energy savings and you don't worry about it we put gauges in there and you're you're a good to go so\nReally has no time to presidents do insulation\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine in Tom's number Tom can answer the phone right now sometimes he does but he's on the air right now it goes to his truck the staff at the office they're fantastic um you know I have to complement you and your team often when people in an office or answering the phone\nIn a customer service department at at home service business like yours they're just not as sharp as your people I mean your people are articulate they're very educated on the process and the product right there courteous and if they don't have an answer they'll get it\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone at the two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nThey're addict is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet exactly so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radical can measure it for insulation or for Indian barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it 'cause most people have kind of an idea like I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or what a resin like OK and will measure and it's like yeah sure nothing's right I'm just kind of the normal will just come out with you a quick measure make sure where everybody on the same page\nAnd we'll get on the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot I'm so we don't say oh email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kind of stuff will give you the price right down to about so you know right where you stand\nAnd that way you can say you know while the radio was say say the radio was twelve hundred and the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be bad\nAnd then we can make a decision and we can talk over the options the pros and cons of of each so that's why I like to give prices right on the spot so people know where they stand and they can make an educated decision versus just saying if I just emailed them over all the pricing later\nThen but they they don't know which way to go because we're not there and we can't really talk about it and yeah it's better to get it out and we'll sit down even if it takes an hour to to go over well we'll talk to you and we'll figure it out or most of our appointments really let it take about thirty to forty five minutes will come up and yet it\nTakes maybe ten minutes ago originally we have him and if you want to chit chat and you know give us cookies or something what we'll do that too but it doesn't take long to do this process we're not there to keep you know banging on your end and making you want to buy something I had a company come out one time they were trying to sell me\nA some stuff from my house and they were there for four hours like this is ridiculous it's like what are you guys doing things\nThat are ... are you know if you didn't say yes that's why they're there for forty I kept saying no it's like you know I think that people have said well we're going to think about her I talked to my wife when she gets all of them like great that's fine let's let me know she has any questions give me a call or two I'll give you my cell phone number\nAnd we'll just you know I'm happy to I'm happy to leave for like your he'll call me back and we're just confident we're going to get the business of customers actually going to do an addict\nJob we're going to get to work because our reputation is so solid\nFifty percent off the radiant barrier today heat block ultra\nIt's not two dollars today that's a normal price but here on the check a pro radio show for my listeners is only a dollar per foot dollar per square foot fifty percent off to wait one nine three six zero five five nine how many of these are you giving\nAway today are wanting to for those written we do a little less on those because we have to ... in the morning because he just gets too hot in the onto the radiant work out so we limit that a little bit more for will do for those\nFour to eight one nine three six zero five five nine for callers only I'm so radium barrier it's something that some of my listeners will need to order for me when something wrong and that is because um for the past handful of years builders have put them in New\nBills yes all the new construction has radiant bear the houses six or seven years old or ... or older than that\nThen there was a good chance they they don't have already had barrier\nAnd if you don't have already beret and then there's probably an eighty percent chance that we would recommend it no reason we wouldn't recommend it is the ... completely covered in three ... you know you just don't have that rating energy hitting the roots of why would you need it\nOr um if you are getting some somebody but you have unbelievable ventilation and the addict\nAnd we feel like well the heat's coming in but it's being exhausted properly maybe you don't need a radio there or for that as well say you know you could use the rainy Barry but maybe the little more ventilation would be a little less caustic ... expensive below more cost effective to go ahead and just put a solar fan and\nSo that's what we do the addict analysis um I'd recommend reading but I have it in my house and of course\nUm I Would never have a house without a rainy and bourbon and especially if you're exposed to if you're a host you know I was if it was like a ... and it was covered with treats I did have a house out there and it didn't have already berry and it was under three hundred percent trees I didn't need ... put it in there was no point\nI'm just insulated really well so sometimes there's different things that we can do maybe we can\nIf you're leaning one way or that maybe we over insulated a little bit just depending on the on the house and how it's structured or somehow says you can't put more inflation than because they've got it all decked him they store stuff up to their addict\nAnd they've got stuff everywhere it's like okay well we really need to work on the addict temperature because we can't get enough inflation there because you got all your stuff up there so that would definitely would record origin or radio ... and then maybe some sort of things we want to keep the temperature down as low as possible so every house with a little different that's why we do the analysis\nHow many of these can you give away today or for for the audience yes call now to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you're interested in getting ready and barrier done if your house is older than you don't have it you should consider it how do you know if you haven't gone to your attic if there's nothing silver on the roof deck and when you're looking up\nYeah just walk down the stairs I'll look up you didn't need to go up in there you know ... exactly\nJust nails coming through from the jingles if the deck in and the nails are not silver or there's nothing over it right meaning of silver rating very then there's different types than you I'm don't habits\nCall Tom to eight one nine three six zero five five nine for callers only [noise]\nThe phone number will
