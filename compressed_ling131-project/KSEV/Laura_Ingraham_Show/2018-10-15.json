what happened but of course he um he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and you know he you know he's he's an Islamic even though in New York Times today said look the guys in Islam asked but also had been a path royal servants now doesn't mean you should she obviously shouldn't be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war\nOver a person you know like the person being killed or snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is how does that make any sense pap\nWell really vicious vicious a classic case of the question of morality versus state interest or could show he is I mean from everything we know showed he went in there they brought in a forensic expert from Saudi Arabia where the bone saw\nAnd he didn't come out and you had Fifteen guys going onto planes are coming out the same day and the Turks have a lot of tapes in videos on him and we've got some information that\nThe prince of Saudi Arabia was trying to lure him back to Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose [noise] so but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia crown prince and the gang put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line\nThat they did not do this and I'm sure you've got to America is checking it out\nAnd the same time as this looks like a real atrocity tomorrow at ... at the same time they're very serious state interests in us relations with Saudi Arabia so you've got to balance those things out\nYou know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toaster mouth shut down at the same time they're going through the massacres of the great pro tour and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality and state interest\nThat it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's undeniable that

Russia ah on occasion with other Republican villa climate just you know I think acts like Russia's in sometimes\nBe a bigger threat than it is even though he's been fantastic actually lately on China Rubio has been great this is what he said about Saudi Arabia yesterday\nWe're already opera magnets the investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take them to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong immune for camping symbolic it can't just war\nTheory I realized that\nI Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent [noise] uh you can't just brushing this well if if the investigation points to the crown prince and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally say you can't come to the United states and she uses bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the Saudis are now working with the Turks and the Turks are a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest and not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states sorghum or you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral position you gotta take which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested it to the solution is going to be the inevitable world agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\nWell and they wanted to give the crown prince deniability right I\nMean this is ... and ... were quick exactly that are or are down you know when I was running a
