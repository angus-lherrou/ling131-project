in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in judge Kavanaugh position where I'm I was attacks was molested or in a doctor's office in fact\nAnd then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation [noise]\nUm so I Would have believed her if\nShe had come out with Kavanaugh's container and said you creep you did this to me and if he had taken her demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was at high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a natural on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resign\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\nOr a um I I just wanted to say I think um everyone\nTries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible but that's because it's the polite thing to say it's the politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists [noise]\nI think anybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible and Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social life and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here and I\nI appreciate it eight five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history it's not the most difficult I'm In Indiana I think it's worth it you know why\nYou can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous corroboration who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it we know people who practice emotional extortion\nA political extortion\nDishes or they're just like an emotional terrorists\nSo

this could be your father your brother's she's getting excoriated and the media or they're saying he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the present a hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case you know a doctor for what you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed that they didn't expose it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger a tip by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are well right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting their listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nHad Lou everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake or our in the elevator and then he gave me it turns out the woman and the co executive director of of the ... funded group Center for democracy and turn the tables were again sunshine I knew who are people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you can make the argument senator that\nAre in many a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer can do this or just go to good litigation attorney could do this kind of a it's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nThere apps get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans where they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else it should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats have been playing office for the last hundred years it's time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and low and and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense is is this is the time right now\nA senator for do uh there's so much a that it's happening a positive or in this administration\nThe news has been under a minute and laying on her mentally negative um because that's just one of the media are they're not going to that right I mean we had this NAFTA deal path okay oh your beyond that don't have to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big ... Obama ridiculed maybe the way this magical I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work [noise]\nUh and and you know if you're nothing on this huge alone milestone for them to minister Asian\nIt's huge but it's part of it as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in denuclearization of North Korea this presence agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the off is talking about what's working in this gender before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you that senator no one's going to want to try to stop\nMe moving in a public street or try to harassment restaurant\nOkay there's a tolerant that anyone from my family and my kids they they they better be they better be really ready because I Am not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents and and it's free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home near rich parents and and who pay for your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism on the side and I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nFloor that's what we're going to be under the this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging in citing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nAnswer for out oh Dr Ford or anything else these are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what to say here\nYou have enough Republican money banks types\nTo counter the effort of style and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in Newark and to voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nOr this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh ... you and you had to throw the Republicans out and Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing Stacey Abrams Abrams who they lost\nWeight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good parts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nWas pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia is drawn thirty million dollars from um uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia still that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen war\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday it seemed to kind of shift the Goldstone so little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor what the committee left us\nI was very troubled by the tone of the of of the room or a the initial defense or the judge Kavanaugh gave ... was something I Hope that I Would tell them that\nCapital I gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would tell them that ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... says uh although cloture\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment this way in court\nAnd who I think now bears have bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets hot convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause an evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen\nIn decades law and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded and quite frankly this is just the the tip of the spear of what their ... their market activity I actually\nA Center for new in Georgia and going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what is that people need to know I'm again this is Paul VI landmark\nPretty decent polling outfit are likely voters hum and it was basically forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth the economic growth and Georgia's been very strong but what could have left wing governor due to that gross\n[noise] well here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants to always give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else is can do the issue Georgia right now is right at the best state in the country and which to do business and she wants to tear that doubt\nWe have a great Republican candidate blind camp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia maybe they've gotten a little uh a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet deal I think camp should make that is a huge issue down there and push\nPush this uh mistakes you said the aim then it should come out on the cabinet thing that I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in a figurative way not literal way don't start talking about yeah you should say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say is like slice and dice studies left wing groups again\nFunded by George Soros and hateful little people in their basements um but I I Hope they continue to press it this year because I Can't imagine that people in charge of like what they

health care piece that did have pre existing conditions and so they're just it's it's a lie of the first order a and they're doing it across the board and so we we got to get the word out to voters and so folks out there you know look up data ... dot com and help me out it yeah\nYeah Dave rent dot com everyone go there ah contribute to this campaign because Republicans are being outspent because we have mega billionaires led by fire insurance ... since the Washington Free beacon pointed out a few days ago\nRuling out huge amounts of money for state focus donations for a campaign to excuse me\nAnd they know it it just comes down to turn out in the mid term race it comes down to turn out in energy\nAnd Donald Trump demonstrated I think very well that\nIt's not just you know it's not just uh how much money and spend on advertising however uh it it ... it matters that you get air time it matters that you are fighting for the people against these types of August tactics\nAre on the left or this these vicious intimidation campaigns the demonization of boys and men and brothers and fathers and husbands and I would call those issues congressman because I think this I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue\nEven though you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines I think\nIt is an awakening for Republicans is mid term election cycle your thoughts\nYeah no you're you're right on the ... I I Want what I Want to get a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came from the laughs wearing a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my last town hall it's all on video people go Google it said that that people just leapt door walkers or\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the door and then my windows taking pictures walking around these just wrapped hell day that my daughter has to retrieve you know half hour later she stayed in the house that go out but God\nUh and then the young man that was busted we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour\nAnd so I you know I what do you conclude from that\nUh it it's not good out their their their you know ... people at a restaurant\nOr no due process or in it it's the left is fighting with tactics we just never seen before and especially on the fundraising and so get out there no matter where you are in this country and support does support the conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks\nThat are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one that's all they need help too but uh it just ... you're right or we just need to stay on message at\nOne of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates the mainstream voter rights or Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was for open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law that they're running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah in fact her ceilings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to write and how it's going to be over four and a half right it's unheard of ... it's like Kennedy extreme but you didn't Kennedy did supplies\nI but I Will tell you David or they don't tell you this tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with\nThey um when the medically challenge child\nIt's about emotional pain so you have the emotional argument in your father's your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been a hit then you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington\nAnd and yeah well I met that's right and that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people to outlaw hung up on a motion to\nDo with that my my opponent said don't they'll look at the numbers are skinny number in my response to that and go look at a hundred billion Wal Mart shoppers whose sales or through the roof and that the kitchen table issues right everybody's life is way better off now everybody\nTwo thousand bucks back in the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table this year and so they are they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are what are we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing invested ... together and like you said we've got to type stories\n... ... people is Ryan and raising money for you for joining the money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but is he ... ... ... raising money in parties are you getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out a ... a bunch of other outside groups are coming in to help out a thank goodness and so they're doing that around the country and ah we were we didn't win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the\nOptimism every small business I go meet with or buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment or hiring one more person that but that's a huge deal most up where I live which has made their small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need everybody out everybody out and vote until your church your church your business is your sports clubs\nJust all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor we're not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward it's was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base\nAnd thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way it is in the rose garden yesterday uh oh was it yesterday a mundane science Monday during the NAFTA announcement said that\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they won border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running and plugs raises it may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this also in a in Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our lab rich right we we let it be known that nine Senate Democrats will block us until right now we don't have at the beginning of the cycle or it after the election our laboratory back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries up his election\nAnd of mine and the people want to see it\nRallying cries of his election and up my mind and the people want to see it and a nine Senate Democrats ... uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole party gotta come behind the president on this immigration issue because it is a big issue that just\nDivides the crony elites up and they say you're from the average person back in my district yeah everybody I talk to\nYou you want a wall you want to seal the border you want to get rid of a gang activity and ... it's not just immigration is tied

soldiers winning in in bed and got Santa and the spurs they gave him to one of the leaders of the expedition\nAnd there was well documented newspaper articles et cetera through the years showing that family owned them and then they sold him a couple of years ago I think to wealthy old guy in Dallas um but\nI'd love to have the penny worth a million bucks even though I wouldn't keep out priced so immediately but it's kind of a interesting trivia okay flew over trivia and then I promise I'll get more mainstream\nI talked earlier for a moment in Europe they kept castles and things intact because you always left it to the elder son in in most of the money so if you're a daughter you would hope to marry someone else's elder son or if you were younger son you just knew that\nYou weren't getting the castle now\nI got to think that a lot of folks were quite elaborate about getting the castle because a lot of families really struggled to keep them going all the upkeep and everything goes with having a capital [noise]\nWell when if you were a wealthy family in a castle country house you're made would heat up water if you would in in that you took a bath right so here's how the housework\nThe father of the family would take the first bath 'cause\nOf water was the warmest and then the oldest son would get up out in the same bat and then the bomb and then the kids on age\nThe last person if you live with a calf or state house to get in the bath water was the baby so father oldest son ... kids in Asia order because of the baby was last that's where the phrase came from

in my office I have an HP calculator on my desk in my a conference table but I'll run that number here in just a minute\nAs important to have it back I Know hey this might be interesting I talked to a guy today\nComing in and he knew someone bought farmland near bred them and held it like forty years\nAnd he had gone up like seven percent a year so and and he asked me goes how much did things usually appreciate\nSo every time I meet with someone not every time it many times when I meet with someone I Will say to them you know or or if they sold the house how long have you lived in it what did you pay for what did you get\nAnd even when someone is live in memorial village or Tanglewood or some highly desirable appreciating neighborhood it's really unusual that house would appreciate it more than three or four percent a year long term\nThe compound number that makes people rich is Fifteen Percent a year\nSo it's really interesting how a little bit extra can make a dramatic difference [noise] yesterday I talked about a lady who left nine million dollars to charities\nShe retired when she's Ninety six it a law firm\nAnd she was there sixty seven years so\nIf you think about sixty seven years to have nine million dollars will say you're in stock so you got seven and a half percent\nYou would need to say just like you know three four grand a year so I'll run the numbers is going to take me a minute and actually I hate to say it I'm not sure my calculator can take it from one penny to a million but that will give it a try okay\nAppreciate your call thank you\nHi Jeff what can we can see v\nA state that you're doing good hey a\nFestival or your shows ... cancer that correct they are right that time\n[laughter] hey let me ask you this I'm fifty three like and bought a hundred and bring a I have I have three two dollars in college or in high school and um I heard you talking earlier about well but I Wonder and it has\nHad a lot of famous that's most of our money does the bills and so I'm just kind of getting that tried to get an idea what for the best direction for us to start figuring that out\nSo the majority of people who successfully accumulate a sizable ... do it through their company retirement plan they say that all the I ... it came out of their pay check before they see it\nOK okay\nNow I Can't lie caught in that group\nCalled my group and I had them I'm a instead of doing ... percent out of my four one K. um I I just said five and saying look go ahead and doing the rest of the five I don't know how much they'll come out of my check but I'm fairly Kate and help more than ... in the long term\nWell if you were saying ten percent and you dropped it to five percent that's not really in the right direction right\nCorrect yeah I haven't been to say yeah I'm trying to get to that point\nAnd what I found is a successful approach is the rains that one percent a year\nOkay okay that's after you get ... percent right or the the way\nIf you start at five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve have you started to and try and work your way up to Fifteen\nAnd then there's max added Fifteen yep okay\nOkay I appreciate jail thank you\nThank you Bye bye her numbers to eight one five five eight five seven three eight to eight one five five eight\nK. F. C. V. if you took a penny in Seventeen Ninety two and you invested it over two hundred twenty six years she got eight and a half percent interest is not going to be worth\nA million bucks so the gentleman that called a moment ago and embarrassed humiliated me pointed out my shortcomings by not using my fiancee calculator for compound interest I now have the answer\nEight and a half percent a year so here's what's really interesting [noise] so it's a penny grows to a million dollars over two hundred twenty six years eight and a half percent a year that's amazing right\nI mean think about it it's a hundred million times where it started\nBut that said ... percent a year\nSo housing it's unusual if\nIt goes up more than three or four percent a year in Houston and you think about it let's say it's four percent a year but upkeep on the house is probably one percent of the value of property taxes are two two and a half percent\nA house is not an investment house in something you live in you pay for that real estate can be in about ... I Know a lady that had five acres on the same it's a toll road\nI don't know Thirty years ago thirty five years ago the toll road wasn't there the city came in\nIt got bigger she sold a commercial and she went out to where the grand parkway is bought another five acres and back to a bunch of money invested it well she read listening so that she went out one more time\nSo real estate was an investment\nIf you're a farmer you have to pay for your real estate typically you want to hold it at some point it's forced investment uh really house during their moments that can be an investment but in general it's overhead by it get it paid for be done with it\nSay the equity portion or the fixed income portion of my retirement portfolios for people that are say five years into their retirement\nOkay and you could use different things for example let's talk about fixed income\nIf ... and there's\nThere's a lot of different indexes you can use so our average fixed income portfolio has a three year average maturity I don't know an index it's it's an exact Mac [noise] so if we compared our portfolio\nTo a long term index we would have under performed in years when rates are falling and would have outperformed in your in years the rates are going up okay\nIf you have a basket of blue chip stocks [noise] you could compare that more to say the S. and P.\nBut don't are blue chip stocks we have a bias to companies that paid dividends and increasing dividends so for so you need to talk with your financial advisor and figure out what is my goal and now what am I comparing to\nSo here's an example\nIn two thousand nine the s in the overall reduced evidenced by twenty percent\nSo I'm looking at a basket of stocks that has\nEighteenth socks and industries and they raise their dividends in two thousand nine so that basket is not a direct comparison and there's some years it will out performance some years of my under perform\nYou could use the ... you can use the Dow but if you have a diversified portfolio you other perform this year because international have done well hey there have been decades with international ... amazing Heather decades when it hasn't had us stock certainly the last ten years have done a lot better\nAnd what I Would say is if you want to be smart to an index by the index and then you're there right yeah that that simplifies it so like I said hey I Want to be the S P index will no reason to mess around\nAnd try to do something to match it just by it does that make sense\nYes it does um and that's an easy way to go but like I might be more inclined to not match the S. and P. but have part of the S. and P. that will pay me more cash flow\nSo you could you could pick some stocks out of there maybe have a three percent dividend yield has those dividends go up every year\nAnd maybe you under perform sometimes maybe you out perform but as long as you have the cash flow and you're comfortable that you're well diversified you might be okay with that at the ... that that's a good question or not\nSounds sounds great sounds like no matter what you do you always pushing them something different\nOh there's no doubt so let me tell you what I've so here's what we do\n[noise] um our typical clients retired and they need income\nAnd and I'm I I always say this though I don't want anybody to listen to me and go make investment decisions because everybody's situation is different so our typical client wants income inner raids and not go broke run out of money\nSo when when we look at things here's what we wanted to we don't want to do anything with their front or back in the we don't do anything that we can't get liquid\nAnd I think if you're retired and you go into visor and they show your pride replacement private place that real estate venture capital I mean anything that you can't easily understand is probably lax liquidity it's expensive and does it feel good when you're retired so I say let's keep it simple\nStocks long term have made more money\nIn and here's what that means they don't give you the positive in the negatives and stocks\nIf you have a million dollars you put four hundred thousand and socks over the next Twenty years if they make six and a half percent that grows a one point four million if they only made if you did three and a half percent fixed income it's eight hundred thousand\nSo it is true that when you see people that have some stocks they have more money long term now\nOccasionally someone to go wow let's do all stocks you can't do that because in stocks go down five years and you pull money out your principal goes away you don't recover\nSo in this example maybe someone with a million has four hundred and stocks had six hundred thousand and fixed income rates going up you want a short maturity you might get three three and a half percent but that's your cushion\n[noise] when I'm Out in um San yesterday portion you mix of stocks but if he also use he asked her mutual funds\nYour other than it might not have a friend or a Mac and feed their image of found itself is gonna is going to have some kind of a ministry of theme built into\nYes there's nothing free that I found but like on an ATF like you were mentioning I think we use the UPS and I think the internal\nYou're mentioning I think we use the E. T. S. and I think the internal the might be one fourth of one percent so here's what we do on stocks\nWe do half big blue chip stocks to pay dividends that are raising the evidence okay\nAnd and I and in example of what might what what someone like as my own and again I'm not selling you buy to buy it would be things like\nYou know United parcel apple computer Microsoft Exxon coke Johnson Johnson McDonald's Philip Morris I mean those are just going to be around and they're paying dividends\nAnd actually I think apple things out more dividends and even Exxon does not sure but I think it's close\nSo we'll do half blue chips we know the companies like to dip it in like I'm going up and the other half\nWill do indexes like exchange traded funds small cat mid cap international we could have a little bit of emerging markets and here's the key I think his they'll be extreme\nLike I Would never want to be all out of stocks I Would never be all in socks\nDon't try to climate I've never seen anyone can do that successfully but we let them ... tell us when to rebalance so somebody has a million dollars and four hundred thousand in stocks if it goes up to four hundred and fifty we pull out some profits and build up or reserves\nIf it drops we either add or weight and with our reserves we can wait a long long time I mean if you told me four years ago steep Donald Trump's going to be your next president and the market's going to go crazy\nI wouldn't have believed it or if you're telling me Rocco bomb was going to serve eight years the White House in the market is going to be amazing I might not have believed it but we're in right we know seven out of ten years socks and made money we're diversified we want to participate\nIn a few said what's your typical quite done the last four years which they leave you know pull profits off the table\nBecause you want to rebalance it's really kind of simple and some people go oh that's too simple well it's simple it's low cost effective and it it's a strategy we can all understand so that's that's kind of what we did\nOne last question um I hear you talk about your four percent rule that um you know if if you can live off of four percent return on the portfolio you're probably never going to deplete the portfolio\nIn years that you say pull out six percent should it in the next year only try to yeah to present them\nTo ... to balance it out long term\nSo I'm Me and if you're going to overspend in one year in you could cut back the next year that would be nice we've all got a little bit spoil the last eight or nine years because investors have done so well we could afford to overspend on occasion\nWhere people have a problem is that they overspend year after year\nI had a client that got a great deal on a camper and spent forty grand on it\nThe next year he walked in and said I've got to get a bigger truck to pull this camper and he spent forty extra on the truck and the third year he came in and said I've been in this house Thirty years we're going to live here till they curious out we need to re model any spit fifty\nSo you're over spent forty forty and fifty and a half of the roof three years were investments were going down which happens on occasion that was a huge problem\nSo occasionally if you handle things correctly and you over spin some it can be okay but like it's better to overspend like the last two or three years when we've made a lot of money that it might be at a down market see kind of half the time that I'm In\nI'm wanting to give an example but I always wear I put people to sleep but\nLet's say on a million bucks you pulled out forty thousand a year\nYou're four hundred thousand in stocks to generate to present the evidence eight grand your six hundred thousand a fixed income at say three and a half percent is Twenty one or I'm Sorry you know is", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "03"}
