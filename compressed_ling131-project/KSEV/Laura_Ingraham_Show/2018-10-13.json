now will come in\nLast Robert [noise]\nWent from here with the last Roberts hijab can talk about irrational exuberance today because well\nWhile the markets continue and they're very bullish trend over the last decade the question becomes you know have we gone too far\nOr in relation to what the underlying earnings and growth of the economy actually\nAre you know when we talk about irrational exuberance are clearly sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future and lower rich premiums imply higher prices are stocks another earnings assets\nWhat's that simply means is that when you have low inflation and low interest rates that should theoretically lead to higher at that price as\nWell and that's the way it's worked throughout history um in fact\nWhen we do this but how do we know when irrational exuberance says unduly escalated that said values which then become subject to unexpected and pro long contractions as they have been in Japan over the last decade\nInterestingly enough that was said by Alan Greenspan in Nineteen Ninety six or the famous line irrational exuberance was as asset prices were moving into one of those faster steep and sharpest rises\nIn us history from Nineteen Ninety six to Nineteen Ninety nine of course that was the peak of the dot com boom market exuberance at that point of course led to a the dot com crash a shortly followed\nThe but as we look at this hour we once again seeing very much the same things in the markets today\nYou know interestingly the market since the election it's had a very very strong and dance and of course we've had three massive hurricanes we had two major wildfires billions in funding be put to work since the beginning of this year and you'll notice right here the steep decline in the deficit starting in October Seventeen or by the way this is when\nUm the hurricanes here and we begin funding\nA profile solving a lot of these hurricanes wildfires et cetera\nI sharp decrease in increasing the deficit money being flowing into the economy of course combined with tax cuts has led to this continued rise in the market\nOf course over the last several months and again expectations are currently that well this will just continue because earnings are fantastic well earnings are fantastic because of ...\nOf course a lot of the issues are with repatriation dollars going to share buybacks let me joining example of something here\nAnd this is reported earnings are for the ... going back to two thousand fourteen and this is the cumulative percent change in earnings so in other words in two thousand fourteen accumulated percent change in earnings was about two two and a half percent\nA back there it didn't slow down and two thousand Fifteen sixteen when we went through kind of the or the uh weak economic environment a beginning and and twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen known and paper tantrum and now that the fed was raising interest rates\nAre already starting to recover and late twenties early twenty Seventeen of course when we got the tax cuts Bush we saw this big jump in earnings per share Allen after tax base to other words the tax cuts provided a huge boost\nEt cetera which has driven asset prices and elevated asset prices well above long term means a well above what actual price of profitability would dictate more importantly what what economic growth would dictate\nSo the question becomes how do you navigate that type of a market well\nWe talk about managing risky managing portfolios all the time and as a portfolio manager there are some basic rules of managing money and managing a portfolio that\nThey're not my rules I didn't create them these are rules that have been involved over time through experience and through other people's experiences and the great the best way to learn about managing your own money and training your own money\nIs by looking at people that have been through this before that have established themselves as great traders people like Paul tutor Jones Benjamin Graham cetera and what you'll find as when you when you look at their philosophies in their principals they may all word it differently Warren Buffett says rule number one\nDon't lose money roll number to\nRefer back to rule number one well that's the same principle as as policy to jump saying don't buy losers so it's not a question of how they're worded the question and the message is basically the same between all major great investors of our time\nAnd so today we're in and cover seven trading rules help you manage your portfolio better here's the problem though\nThey're impossible to follow because of our psychology because of our own behaviors and we do everything wrong because of our psychology so why\nThese trading rules will do is help you set aside the emotional components and help you focus on the risk management of your portfolio so you can be a better investor longer term\nNow just because these are trading rules this doesn't mean that you have to be a traitor we're not talking about day trading where you're in stock today this minute next minute and out\nThis applies to even long term investors overtime a lot of people that\nThat I talked to was like I don't need to understand that I'm going to buying whole stuff I'm a whole whole self very long term and that's great so are we were long term investors but we managed risk along the way because we understand that eventually markets correct and if I lose principal\nThen I have to spend time making up my principal before I can start working on actually making money again getting back to even\nIs not the same as making money so if I can limit the downside risk by managing the risk in my portfolio well I can do better as a portfolio manager as an investor longer term so let's start let us take a look at the seven impossible trading rules\nAnd what we can do to ... to manage our money better than an obvious one is to sell these are short letter writers run this is a common theme among many major investors that ... that have invested money over long term\nAnd basically what it says is that if you have a position that's not working well sell it because it doesn't mean that if you sell position as a loss that you're a loser but that psychology what we think oh I you know I'm losing money on this if I sell it I have to admit that I was wrong well\nInvesting is like being married if you want to have this successful marriage just tell your wife you're wrong you'll do better over time by doing that same thing comes to manage your money admit you're wrong and sell your losers what's your winters continue to operate\nA very basic good rule to follow his do more of what works and less support doesn't and you'll be a successful investor over time\nThe second rule is is by cheap and sell expensive the sounds easy but this is one of the hardest rules ever to follow up just like number one it's hard to follow because well we don't want to sell when something losing money because we have to admit we're wrong\nSo we wind up holding it hoping it'll get back to even well same thing goes with buying cheap and selling expensive we want to buy value stocks we want to buy things that are under price because we buy value that means I'm going to have a better opportunity to make money in the future\nBut what we do instead is that we buy expensive and we sell when things are cheap we do things exactly the opposite because well\nWhen things are rising and things are expensive well that's what we want to be invested in the market so we buy stuff that's overpriced we try to come up with some excuse or metric as to why it's cheap this time\nBut when things are truly cheap at the bottom of bear markets well we don't want to buy it because we think everything's going to zero so again we have to understand that our psychology makes us do everything exactly backwards we have to buy one\nI have to understand that our psychology makes us do everything exactly backwards we have to buy when things are the worst and we need to be able to sell when things are at their baths and today things honestly can't get much better than they are today but yet this is where people are wanting to jump into the markets and wanting to buy assets thinking things will only go up for me or\nUm the odds of a future returns are much lower today than they were back in two thousand nine when things were actually cheat and this lady just said number three which this time it's different the belief is that when markets are rising over time that they'll they'll just keep on writing and we get to this point psychologically where there's very little fear in the markets\nPeople are concerned of a crash because it's been so long since we've seen one well obviously one's never going to happen again\nThis time is never different valuations are elevated as we talk about a few minutes ago on our last segment with valuations elevated extensions at some of the highest levels in history and some of the deviations from long term means that the longer at the highest period in history\nThe odds of this time being different are basically Neal we're going to have a correction at some point and we're going to have a I lost a capital that we need to be prepared for this time is never different\nBe patient one of the biggest problems that people have investing is being patient patient also means once I own something being patient to let my theory workout that doesn't mean being patient allowing a shock to go down twenty percent again if I have\nA purchase if I bought a position in my portfolio\nAnd it's not working it's not working for a reason I was wrong I Need to sell it and I need to move on and get my capital working opportunity costs is as big as a cost is actually losing money and an investment we've got to keep our money working we want to make it work\nBe patient with your strategy and let it work hit the positions are working if the strategy is working be patient and let it work sometimes a good strategy doesn't work all the time a hundred percent sometimes a strategy like for instance now value is underperforming gross\nBut being patient if you're a value investor be patient with your value strategy because eventually that rotation from growth that can devalue going to be the case and generally when people give up on their strategy and move into whatever is working today that tends to be at the very last into the cycle\nThe other side of the coin it's also being patient to wait just because you have cash that needs to be invested doesn't mean that you need to invest it today\nOur jobs you investor again is to buy cheap we need to buy value we need to buy opportunity where the our ... our risk and reward or in our favor in terms of us making more money than we are potentially going to lose by making investment\nBe patient el allow that opportunity to come to you invest your capital because remember when you're being patient with your money you're saving money and what you don't want to do is destroy your savings by over buying an over paying for assets at the wrong time\nNumber five turn off the television please turn off the television not just by gas just the television\nThe problem with TV is is that every day we're talking about markets are up to date because of this region's markets are down today because of the trees and Trump said that the market did this a Europe did this whatever it is but every day as a reason to buy or sell\nTurning off the TV let you step away from the media driven psychology of markets helps you tame some your emotional quotient center out there some of those emotional behaviors that are driven\nBy media exposure turn off the television step away read study analyze your portfolio understand what you're invested in why you're invested in it what you expected to do and understand what your strategy at\nThe TV only adds to the noise that potentially drives emotionally bad behaviors overtime\nNumber six risk is not equal to return\nThis is one of the biggest fallacies that people have went investing money the more risk I take them more money I Will make\nRisk is not a function of reward in other words you don't jump out of an airplane but no parachute and suspect that you're going to have a very good opportunity all the way down\nReds is a function of how much money you're going to lose when something goes wrong the more risky take the more you're going to lose when something happens one of the biggest problems with an ongoing bull markets a decade long in nature is is that people forget about what Redskins\nI take on more and more risk because as markets continue to rise rising markets bull markets forgive me for my investing mistakes it covers up the things I Do wrong and investing over paying for assets buying poor quality companies rising asset prices cover that up\nA venture only when you had the mayor market all of those risk exposure you have a revealed very quickly\nRisk is not a function of reward risk is a function of walks and so always remember that and of course going against the heard you know the heard in other words the public\nIs generally right in the middle of a marketing bad so you know from two thousand tens of two thousand sixteen them the herd was generally write\nThe heard that the group market however you want to dictate what the current is\nIs generally wrong at the turning points the bond markets and the tops\nWe're that share and and so on our clock when we we eradicated that it's the best ... we could um you can't see how many followers somebody else how um you know we're trying to eliminate that mentality um altogether\nUm we have a liking system or do you see a picture and you can like get by by you know back then start but\nWe've debated on taking that out to right now as a user base the small\nUm you know I think it makes the most sense to leave it in because that's a form of connection so somebody you know reaches our you know that that start to a new possible relationship um but yeah I mean that's pretty much a weekly conversation between me and my team like hey is it time to cut that thing or or mood in right now um because we don't ... I mean we don't want to promote that\nThat um vanity or you know and and so we're trying to trying to get away and I I could also\nSee the other side of that too not just from the vanity standpoint but you're wanting to promote a sport that started dangerous and the one way that people tend to try to get in the famous has to do is to do something very dangerous and promoting and then of course you start potentially promoting dangerous\nUh habits yeah in ... which obviously you don't want to do so yeah\nBut we come back from what I think we're going to come back on TALK a little bit more about it it's kind of an interesting idea of it that you're trying to create the social network for people that are in like sports\nUm I like come back talk a little bit about the the the wealth building out aspect desert as like how are you gonna make money out of this is part and parcel down the road here um but uh we'll talk about that because you've actually been talking to somebody sees out in California I'm of course as as you and I'm working on an apt\nTo so I'm not a right to say that there's going to join the time to raise the capital so that we come back from the break power with Jeff while he's the founder and CEO of act to start to be right back after the break more with [noise]\n\nWhat a log or talk with Lance above your money requests to personal one on one have lamb swab or show dot com\nOut new professional version of really investment advice as comic but you can still subscribe today for free\nHad really investment advice dot com and click on the R.
