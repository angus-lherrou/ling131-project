your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comment\nThe last that means essentially he's a white nationalist John here comments\nOr I I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual around the around identity politics and that's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans into battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home you know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics\nAre the only things that that look the same on us or our uniforms\nAre we are together all American and I have a black message or white Misha said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like out\nOf the progressive marks on the left who don't have a message\nAnd they don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics in order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving it all up together it's exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the alerts to claim racism or at every turn and claim it either combination of being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and\nYou know all people everywhere but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nAnd its Michigan Senate race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insult personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learn from our first of all the English class lead these logical fallacies ad hominem attack\nOn what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part\nHas been a career politician for forty years has collected for a million dollars from the taxpayers only gotten five ... her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... those fiber to remain buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but she's a solid a is a New York senator\nLoaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five Ninety ... some of the time respectively and the promises she's made around\nAround lowering pharmaceutical drug costs around\nTaking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken promises to live said her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask\nIs why should we believe this time center staff and now she will say anything to get reelected they engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this a lot of Debbie Stabenow now claiming she's against sanctuary cities I mean where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie salmon is standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\n'em you know better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants to forty four year career in politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\nShe she's a selective uh in in her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her\nI'm centers to have it on and you can see our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she's the court sanctuary cities and she will not do anything to secure our border she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is not that we need to get done right now all we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who is going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing because this is a matter of a economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if W stamina as we elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction among African American in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran\nAre you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is you know it's it's not something

[noise] why in stocks going down\nWhen interest rates go up and can make it through spring it's much more attractive but usually it's because the economy's doing better corporate earnings are doing

dollars it's been interesting watching the news stories and what to do if you win and there's been some really bad advice\n\nBe lottery ticket that wins as a bear instrument that means whoever bears that whoever shows up with it gets the money\nSome people say sign it immediately but one recent lottery winners signed it immediately and then had major problems in ah they wanted to disclose who want it and she inside it right so they said look you sign your name your the winter\nSo if you claim it as a trust in some states they disclose the name of the trust they might then slows the name of the attorney you prepare it but they don't disclose your name so if you win the lottery belt signing quickly\nHave a buddy guard with you take for family members whatever go see the attorney someone

conditions a three to four hundred bucks to fill up a diesel\nBut what they did is they bought a lot to the park their motor home on in the water\nHas a cabana for gas has outdoor living area and a lot of really really cool little things that go with it\nSo indeed I looked up to say hey what are these lots constantly so we're we're the luck in desert shores resort in India oh California\nYou can buy a lot are you ready for this for three hundred and six hundred thousand dollars to park your motor home on\nAnd then you pull up with your ... million dollar three hundred thousand million dollar motor home\nYou got a villa twelve Eighteen hundred square feet with a great room kitchenette bathroom there was a dog the dog park clubhouse full fitness center financing to Wells Fargo if you want it they Eugene excursions dancing they get together at night they sort of cocktail this like this huge social hour\nAnd a few paid three to six hundred thousand for somewhere to park your motor home you're hanging out with a whole lot of wealthy people\nMichigan I Would not want to live there but summers are fabulous hip Pataki Michigan\nThere are lots for sale they cost a hundred and nine hundred thousand dollars so mad bungalows outdoor entertaining spaces you pull up your motor home when you park at their\nFitness center business sitter tennis pool theater lottery facilities cooking classes bill your turn ... movie screenings I mean you just go there for the summer you pull your big motor home when you hang out with a lot of really successful for people and uh you own your spot\nSo the folks that I visited with three hundred thousand but this motor home to ... to the five hundred thousand I said what do you like about it\nAnd they said well we pull him somewhere typically anybody that has a three hundred thousand dollar motor home is successful educated outgoing or they wouldn't be on the road in adventure so they said we me really really cool fun people\nAnd they enjoy the relationships\nSo I Know there's a place in Colorado on a river I met a couple who voted on an airplane rock recently\nAnd they said Steve for about three or four months in the summer we go out there we open up this place that we owned a very successful people quite well the I think they said we have million dollar motor homes role in we meet some of the most interesting\nThey said we have million dollar motor homes role in we meet some of the most interesting entrepreneurial\nEducated fun people we've ever met we cook out every night we kinda have a community kitchen somebody's always having a cocktail we hang out we talk and they go and then we own we go home at the end of the summer with more money than we came with and it's just like a really cool fun thing to do\nSo that's one thing that some folks do\nUsually when my clients retire and they go somewhere or do something they get the greatest joy from the relationships that come with it\nI have one couple that lives in remote they have an interesting story all share in a moment\nSo I Know people in the horse world and they like riding their horses but they really like watching other horses going to competition interacting with people finding out what's new what's different who taught who's not\nThinking voter arenas across the country and see their folks and they like kind of what sort of heritage that goes with it\n[noise] I have a group of three retired clients to play golf three days a week\nAnd some time on the fourth day if somebody's birthday so they play golf three days a week or if it's a members birthday three guys their wife's love to get them out of the house and they go to variants country courses typically and they get things at a discount\nSo very interesting I see people that that gets their sense of community at the country club [noise]\nSome people get a church some people in the neighborhood\nI some clients that lives on a porch a barge is really about it's kind of flat I I Would characterize it as a large house about\nSo they would travel around not across the ocean but inter coastal canals rivers they went up river in Tennessee they found a community they loved it\nThey bought a house they're sold their boat and there was a club there that you could be a member of for two years if you're a new member of the community the first two years there were certain meetings that events and they met people like that\nThere is a funny side note they look at on a barge which is about three hundred square feet\nAnd it was full they bought a house with two thousand square feet they couldn't believe all the room and three years later it was full so I guess I learned from the new already we tend to fill up what are we have just kind of a funny funny thing\n[noise] so I have clients that live overseas and clients visit overseas\nI've applied to severe a cottage in Wales thirty days all bill paid a has high speed Internet so at the Internet they could watch TV they can do Netflix they can make phone calls just like the local they paid twenty eight hundred bucks\n[noise] it's a three bedroom stone cottages a charming will village and they love the sense of community and the people that they've met\nI'm white and Mexico and I of course soccer often she writes the blog and actually went to visit her city and San Miguel Mexico now Mexico's not on my list of somewhere I Want to go mail but here's what was interesting\nIt's a beautiful um town with old stone roads around kind of square in a church\nIt's probably Fifteen to twenty percent ex patriots people from other countries and they love to hang out together they'll go to lunch spend two hours drink a bottle of wine thick ... stuff\nBecause it's in the mountains the electricity bills very low or they don't need air conditioning they pay the costs of real estate comparable to what you would pay as you said\nThere are other bills are incredibly low\nWhat about going to the doctor will they go to doctors that have been educated in the U.S what about pizza yes they can go out for pizza they watch us TV stations and what I call them the answer the phone just like my called you [noise]\nEvery experience they have is different and unique when you live in another country whether it's going to the grocery store are going to find you know to get some clothes alternative dry cleaners whatever everything's a new experience\nAnd what I've seen from my clients that live in other communities is that they tend to really bond and socialize with other interesting people doing the same experience\nSo I have a client that lives in a hundred and fifty year old stone building in sexy condo in the heart in the old part of Panama City Panama\nAnd they love it and they always have been interesting things going on so for some people who retire you don't have to buy a home there you could rent a home there that would have touched on this briefly because I covered it recently\nIf you bought a four hundred thousand dollar home in the country that four hundred thousand that you can't use and this is a comparison of renting versus a second home will say you invested that four hundred grand made four percent a year they're sixteen thousand\nThat you're missing out on your property taxes on record of ... eight thousand okay now we're up to twenty four thousand out of pocket cost\nJust your electricity thanks a cup keep water take care of the water well get the lawn mowed the other four or five hundred a month [noise] really afford a thousand or a second home is probably costs you thirty thousand a year\nFor thirty thousand a year you could rent a cottage twelve months a year at a foreign country\nAnd you could probably get our plane tickets to get there for thirty thousand a year you don't have the pride of homeownership in the sign of decorating yourself but you could go places and do things\nI have clients have been four grand a year rent a home and a great neighborhood and Arizona they've done it Fifteen Years they eat out they play golf they go to a certain church every couple of couples actually do that in Arizona\nAnd they spend a fraction of what you spend on a second home\nSo when you retire\nHopefully the world's your oyster and you've traveled and do things\nA big motivator for people to buy our visas they can take their pets with them
