think that he is it doesn't have the right manners they sit on the sidelines expect us to be passive and meanwhile the country's being taken from us by these relentless people on the left\nAnd and just the Democrats are just so shameless and it's a parody of themselves they said they wanted the FBI investigation that was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any original is on there they want somebody who will preserve\nThis judicial philosophy they don't want any original is on there they want somebody who will preserve\nTheir judicial manufactured right to an abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting like pre announce that they would reject them and it's despicable I'm sick of our\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the\nMost qualified than I Am and one one of those things is worried people signed judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble rousing and chaos and meanwhile Trump\nAnd slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made me so we know we don't have the wall which is in Congress this fall\nBut we did read it NAFTA\nHe's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share you got that tax reform through again not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now it's more than seven of all federal judges are Trump appointees uh and obviously it's cabinet gets confirmed I think he will be confirmed\nThat means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long path a Trump Administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say well the reason you guys want Trump is just because of gorgeous well\nNo they're not just because of him it's because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy of the economy is taxes\nAnd its regulations it's better trade deals and say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there who will fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize that we're in a in a serious battle\nTo preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is\nAnd where mccaskey and all the others are college but I'm hoping with his FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the the audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you has emerged yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church in your new book on Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nYou're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ...\n... in in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand\nHow the early church was formed how unlikely it was that the followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and develop their entire lives and and give their lives or to this uh this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ\nOr tell us about why this book was you know what's so important for you to write at this point in your own life\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands on I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something some some books some guy the premise that would help me understand it better than the less intimidated so as I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last week I wrote was about the gospels and ... put it paraphrase him and stayed at most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nWhich follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of\nOf adversity and opposition and secular influences core and it was a hotbed of\nSexual immorality and I'd dollar trade with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church\nThere's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which is faith then Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing it up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to ... to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says something like the golden my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely\nOf Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was\nSteeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd when he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were a new competing religion\nBut that they were perverting the religion of God and when it was Judy as well as the religion of God's ... and and there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be the messiah because they expected the Jews expected a military our political\nAnd deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd they didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was a hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver the victory he didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't beat them aside and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the sand heater and to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and then in that periphery of the Roman empire and established churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him in the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual and relentless\nAnd determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um where are you talking about how the apostle Paul correct\nOh the apostle Paul corrected obviously in the letters the current in church um\nAnd it was the way he did it was not condemning Atari language or no railing at them planning a thing as you're going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that's a great lesson and I think I Need to take that less than\nSomebody that we all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you said but that's not really the way to change minds\nNo and you can argue people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics\nYou know you you don't want to be too strident and he what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never delivered the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews you would\nAdopt their practices ... as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles there's around ... would do what they did he was talking with invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and at the relate to them and then he would present\nThe truth out of the universe and the gospel\nOf salvation through Jesus Christ\nAnd it was kind of reminds me of one of my favorite apologist today Ravi Zacharias who says when we approach people in a van July and tell them about to say\nWe want to understand the question or as much as the question they asked meet them where they are understand where they are because you're not going to for rape somebody in the kingdom you have to tell him about the good news and do it in a win some way and and that will hopefully lead to the best response\nNow and again is\nTrying to advance allies and in the world today or as it is with the rise of Islam\nWith the broken nets of our culture or with the poison and pornography all of the things that we're seeing around us yet there is always hoping God in Christ that he represents the light of hope in the light of truth and I think\nThat's Harry dot com codes for three four three enjoy [noise]\nWere conservative time they're boys am several numbers KFC all used to\nFor each of those

about they already starting the choirs match or whatnot and got life insurance policies four one K.\nOr what what do you typically recommended clients on where to keep some of that information they are like they were for me and my wife travel one we looked at it what does that are like ... what are you simply tell clients or where something was to happen to get\nThere you know with that said while we're on vacation and got ...\nSo I have a filing cabinet and I have a file and then if I die file\nHave live insurance have coffee my will and then I have basic information on where myself is I'm making concentrated effort to keep all my things pretty simple and straightforward\nOccasionally I'll be up late at night I'll think of something\nThat's important that I'd want someone to know like I'd want you to talk to my CPA about this investment I've heard this a best friend is no longer it's paid off or whatever I put that data in there so\nHow do you have that electronic anywhere I mean just in case of now I don't know just my mind they could have a house\nMarco yet or if you die in the house for sale or if you if you die in the household and burns down I mean let's just get as tough as we can be\nA year ago I don't have an electronic but most things that are important I also cheaper file at work\nOkay but I'm kind of neurotic about all that I even have a copy of my family movies at work in fact you and I buy some time and see my kids when they're two or three I'll whip amount we've watched family movies are so important\nThings I Do keep it work it would be hard to pull together my regional will is in a will\nVote with my attorney okay everybody on my team like kids though or my wife those are the people I work with lower they would know right where to go and get my will\nOkay so\nHow old are your kids\nAre Thirteen and four\nOkay and then you or do you and your wife both work outside the home\nYes okay and how how much life insurance do you have\nA I'm In the primary though I mean she works part time right now I got about a little five hundred others about seven hundred and fifty thousand\nOkay and how old are you already said\nOkay so if you died primary breadwinner to kids you and your wife came to see me was seven and fifty thousand dollars and it looks just say she paid off the house paid off everything and she had six hundred thousand left\nHe could probably pull out about two thousand a month of investment income now does she go to star know does she have a nest egg to get on her feet yes his or enough money there to take care of her raise your kids get the kids to college\nNo so here's my point life insurance a level term life insurance policy I'm keep it simple I'm keeping a low cost it's really affordable\nAlthough I'm going to pull the number out of the year and I really should look I bet for forty bucks a month you can get another similar and fifty thousand\nSo you know my goal was always they have enough insurance that if I die\nTo raise my kids go to college to take care of my wife\nAnd I wanted enough money that if I died that she would have enough time to be more particular when she got married the next time right [laughter] she wouldn't have to be the whole desperate thing and grab the Drake I mean she could go high quality high class whole bit\nSo if you are like my best friend my next door neighbor\nWe happened to me we sit down and talked\nI Would say to you can just jump on line look can ensure dot com looking at ... dot com do go to the to the agents there has your home insurance and
