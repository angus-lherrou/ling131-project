on that survives dot com Roger Roger certified financial planner so what if you wanted to retire early fifties really what we all want to do right millennials in particular do you know what I was growing up my dad was was\nGoing to just walk forever right he's one of these guys who worked for major chemical plant for like Thirty years and got his pension retired\nYou know the way the way our parents or is that how you have a fire [laughter] exactly how you financially retire early on on the kids playing by the way\nWas the kids playing it's a it's a commune in involving tiny houses [laughter] or you know well this is this that\nIs part and parcel of this whole fired strategy so fire is the acronym for financial independence retire early and water requires is a commitment to live a very frugal life uh for quite some time so the fire strategy simply this\nSay twenty five times your annual income so if your annual income is say fifty thousand dollars a year\nYou'd say twenty five times regular lane concerts one point two five million dollars you'd say fifty percent of your income every year so in other words right now you're living on rice and beans and out of the back of a cardboard box you say fifty percent of your income\nAnd in just a few years at one point two five million dollars you retire take four percent withdrawal rate and you have fifty thousand dollars a year\nTo live on that and they weren't great stories of individuals who have done this yet and they live dramatically off the grid I mean not many people are going to do it but it is possible it ... ... look anything is possible you know and I mean if you can live frugally enough you can live on pretty much nothing uh-huh do you know\nAre you know the pilgrims did this it's called living off the land to build a damn yeah [laughter] they give me God so what is\nThis um let's take a look at this little differently so Suzie Orman got under a bit of fire because she said that in order to retire earlier in the five million dollars and of course the people the fire strategy way completely ape over this and and calls are all kinds of names\nAnd the reality is is I actually ran the numbers and here's a here's here's the bottom line is is the fires supporters are wrong answers your ...\nThe fires supporters are wrong answers your been drunk and they're both right they're both right they're both wrong and let's go through some of the numbers here real quick so first of all the reason that the fires supporters are wrong\nIs because the idea and such again when she's already sampled fifty thousand dollars that's what you are now say twenty five times during comments or say it takes you a Fifteen Years to do that\nAnd you want to retire with one point five million dollars well the problem is is that in Fifteen Years fifty thousand dollars\nAnd Fifteen Years is not fifty thousand dollars a day because of inflation so here's a chart for you and what you'll notice here is that you can pick your own income level so whether you may twenty five thousand a year or Seventy five thousand a year a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nPick your income level at what the show unions is what that income is in Thirty years so in other words the Seventy five thousand dollars your lifestyle today in Thirty years it will take you a hundred and forty two thousand dollars to live\nYou actually came out well ahead so the point of view is that first of all I Am an advocate for fire I'm an advocate for any program they get you to save money pay off debts and stop stop doing frivolous things with your money\nI Am also a big advocate of managing risking portfolios because the one thing you cannot do spend these very long extended periods of time losing fifty percent of your money and getting back great headline out today is that this time is\nRight about the timing well this time is it there and the reason that this time of the older now you're closer to retirement now you're good you can't afford to go through another thirty would've been encouraging getting back to eat and\nIt's still try to get your money to go on time management with your money saved money pay up there\nAnd talk about food isn't that just\nIs greatest using the\nYou're going to be great\nNew Hampshire Robert forever new show now where we faced with three on last Harvard showed dot com

Robert ... gas right here real ... Tom today are special guest is Lisa ... she's the founder of international mergers and acquisitions you know with the\nU.S China trade war heating up this has been a an issue really just beginning it was here to train not trade to tear up not to tear up to the question of course\nA columnist on both sides of course that comes with the White House in terms of greater make America great again most every other economists tariffs really kinda bad for the economy because the visual pack\nSo our next year losing uh like I said ... she's the founder of international merger acquisition she's got extensive\nExperience dealing with companies that do business in China and the U.S [noise] so let's just really kind of cut down to the quick of this um is there really a need for a trade war with China or is this something that was really more unnecessary to not\nWell first of all thanks for the opportunity to be here um and I do travel a lot you Europe and China and all of us\nSo I hear people I'm from different parts of worth and did issue different they're big Asia right not everywhere I go people at the Aspen same question and for this show corporate I Would like to stay at the fitness level\nGuy we can go to those shows by academics ... we're we're talking about business right yeah no I was going to affect the economy yeah let's talk about it 'cause that's ever enter unity that\nPeople care by most you know from the thigh bones that a lot\nAnd especially right now\nFrom ... community we really wish that the two sides down on can't just sit down and negotiate or whatever then the agreement we have we can move on for ... however we didn't know where that's happened\nSo at the moment both sides gotta her lobbed and both sides but they didn't companies trying to find a way how to survive during the transition and uh you know like my personal experience working on both sides are some company already\nMade it a change decision for the new environment because I think there's enough indication in a market worth a new direction with the how we're going to go back to own a\n... not All right and I spent a lot going back to our days for I'm most likely right now the consensus is working to enter into a new\nA trade order which means China ... possibly going to have a news that the ecosystem and American beer and not that the ecosystem across there is an awesome based on old his them right or however the ... going to be higher than before I'm ...\nAnd ... now are we talking about on both sides higher tariffs on\nBoth sides of it to show it every time we raise on certain products in us and China is going to raise our own system in China that\nOne could example is us of a few months ago us to raise the tariffs on steel and of course the Chinese steel company hurt a lot\nAnd uh some of them and moving just more hope I stated to us by well a good employee is changing pipe in Corpus Christi so they just you know within the u._s. be down with him\nAnd cause some an empire is ah the ah distributors get her to a lot because that whole business model is based on the at\nPrice gap between the two countries right but ... if you look at it who's really getting hurt it's not just a Chinese company also your company and also come from a company in different countries one good example is a worry Houston though a lot of companies are eating the oil and gas\nWith the pipeline construction they require a lot too\nSo uh if you look at some research report recently uh the last ... shell on many acts on any of the three they got away from the ... that means they can still buy from whatever I'm going to write\nI ever have company I came on and they try to buy a one point around one place to have an ... from the Turkish there's ah seems to apply\nThat got down right now have nothing to do with China\nThat American come and get hurt so\nBut you know it helps when your former CEO Rex Tillerson ... yeah um you know in the White House administration it helps to get your company exempted from paying\nA correct right [laughter] so uh so if we look at the original\nAt least the the purpose of a terrier for is trying to made in America and trying to reduce the import from China by by Raddatz is not a match you with the original purpose so so\nYou know what I what I hear you saying at least one I think I hear you say is that ...\n... both sides you're going out I'm going to put on terrorists right or going to put on terror were both going to hurt each other at the end of the day we're going to settle back to something that was really probably\nSo the question is is that if they allow that currency to drift a whole lot from the peg can they can they quote unquote this has been one of the arguments that China could quote unquote weaponize the currency to fight the trade war by letting it drift further from the u._s. dollars\n\nI Would say thoughts coming up very strong right now though they are going to whatever to wait for him play twist and playing ... including the current as a weapon so\nAs far as a you know how did I Do now and I can I don't want to ... it's not an estimated that again not read it matters that much and also [noise]\nUm if you look at it globally a kind of is definitely very international Everytime when people in China especially from a consumer standpoint when they buy things at the global person and they have an option to buy German products British products\nLatin American or America or domestic products so the option you saw high is way way more than we can you imagine a however in us relativity is a little bit ... a limited him to do that either made in America\nOr imported from China or India or not the America so to the consumer which is fundamental to all your economy is is it just like a different\nIn so I think these are used in China\nThe American products become more expensive or even ... oriented back from other countries the European products is at least as good as in from politics standpoint go from China consumer standpoint there's really not that much in change or impact\nFrom the people I think that China a manufacturing silver down the U.S market without us Margaret Chinese manufacturers to die but look at today I was I'm a I just made it to American Chamber of Asia high not too long ago and they get they share with me with the most recent updates for the thing is in\nShanghai though China is a ... because the recount has become a lot more wealthy than people in America now\nOr if people have not traveled to China unfortunate that that's a ... they at least twenty Thirty years ago today is a very different and so a\nSort of the labor market in China has changed dramatically and the law or the labor law each time I used to be not even like a huge issue nice to become a serious issue and a\nAt a lot of cost to the manufacturers are in China the within China right now the um the the rich part of China at aspect cannot afford any manufacturing anything there anymore they all either migrate to that or the second or third tier city within China becomes a little cheaper and they were there\nAnd or a lot of them just migrate to him and move out from China to Southeast Asia that's why Vietnam um you know can Modi as those companies I've become really booming for the new manufacturing Center for Asia Pacific in\nYou know and that's you know the same issue that we've seen here in the United states you know and again this is kind of one of the ... I think\nThat the U.S administrations undertaking under this you know make America great again right policy which is you know we're going to bring jobs back to America\nWill the problem is is that corporations and not just in the U.S corporations everywhere right labor is the highest input cost in any product that you build ... companies are going to seek the lowest cost of labor correct terrorists\nAnd the type of of issues raised the cost of labor and manufacturing\nNot lower it so that's just simply force companies to go find other cheaper sources such as Cambodia and Vietnam yet Highlander yet her yeah\nSo so why is the labor costs second they're the ones that are bringing a jock back to America the question do we really want to bring in low and the labor jobs back to the ...\nAnd what we want it to high quality jobs back to us and the high cost jobs tend to end up with a ... type of jobs which the U.S you have very the leading the manage on that ... ... you know close to Austin we have tons of the high hype pay professional jobs\nSo um yeah so we do see a surge in the middle east the manufacturing sector anything these days however de\nOkay the question is do we want our company provider or strong ... just because look I'm trying to you know they could ask are we ready to come so competitive have such a way to product serving in the market no matter what we're going to live and and then it's life\nYou know why I think Craig Hayes who was the c._e._o. of carrier industries you remember right after Trump got elected carrier industry talked about bringing jobs back from Mexico\nUm nobody ever really listen to the interview that he gave shortly after that and he may have just sell your point about exactly what you just said I said\nYou know it's fine that I'm bringing jobs back from Mexico but I'm going to outsource those jobs or automate those jobs ultimately\nHas he says we shouldn't focus so much I'm bringing back and trying to maintain the jobs of yesterday rather build the jobs of tomorrow correct and that's what I ... yeah and and I think that's kind of a of the policy front we shouldn't be taking your increasing education training programs\nYou know we take a look at what's happening with universities now in terms of higher education um you know we need to get back to training are individuals in this country to do jobs that are going to be needed tomorrow right here in this country\nActually I don't think we are a short amount of work a workshop in us out because I was aware of warfare colors when you're working a committee hearings and us\nAnd one of a general comment I hear from the German communities they can find a skilled workforce in America metal and they decide to bring an apprenticeship ... model to us that extend to an end to train the Americans do the way as Germans do back home\nSo that just tells me there's no sort of a work however we are fighting for ... people would go to ... get a work ethic\nAnd willing to do whatever taste to get things done that to people no matter where you go it's always ...\n... ... it's a problem in America getting people to show up for work and we weren't even allowed to social media and we used\nThe founder of international merger acquisition thank you so much for some time with us today we really appreciate it and it just kind of goes for the love to have you back in and talk about who's just continue\nTo progress with China is fair and more love to have you back to follow up on it thank you very much for having me and I'm looking forward

usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency cars at that point never changes right that point never changes salt are consistent income it's not about\nMaking money wants right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on right that you can count on not something that will hopefully this works out raise up that that step by step process that can generate\nMore income in our lives so whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of the things we also have to take into consideration well we want consistent income we need to have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those four\nHundred point down on the on the up and people can have it for four voices out on the Dow and even the other day you know what other foreign imports back up and so it's almost like a a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies\nAnd we're stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call\nAt traders market but its traders market because handled by an old situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of rocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative\nAnd so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry what's your instructor team really help people kind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consists of them come inside\nSeemed really help people kind of harness this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at\nWell I tell you had any as taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is making better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you push through your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nKid there is addict because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together in the family um I get my trading nine and die they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you dream to learn more visit us on line at Houston O T H ... that Houston oh T. A. dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to our trading radio now to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in Eunice Larry Jacobs director of instructor development happens structure it online trading ketamine\nShed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income whether the market's growing up down or sideways\nWe're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the market\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities degenerate into give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that the more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling\nIf you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there was a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yet billion with a B right billion with me come out of it and a lot of times they are looked\nAt as a a a not\nSo that they looked at with not such a plug light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in their ... and those are individuals do who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or were not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nAbout how much opportunity has been lost on the down opportunity how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward\nThis could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down with their doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand the tribe trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational of it later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared my Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there's five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money\nAnd what's really scary right now and I talk to a lot of students who says I ask them simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this Ryan how are you an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that training is like a system what's the system\nIt stands for shape your self stressed time energy and money love if if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this or afraid to do this and honestly\nThey keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example Mick\nFreedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace she quit he wanted to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you share district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys what I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family which is the the job we don't like anymore\nIn so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier is exchanging just time and getting away drag getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money worked for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nThe financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder than our body is working and that the whole time is money concept in something that I used to uh\nUh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that\nAnd so it was very normal thing for me to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I I realize how bad of a mindset that actually is about easy trap to fall into because it's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on his roots are award and having our money work harder than our body one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that the classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways supplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets solve that having that money and work hard rather than your body work hard\nRight now the half day classes about three hours long we have to class but surely going to be investing about three hours of your time to raise that financial IQ and start generating more income inside of the financial markets included with your passes to the half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit\nPacked with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like an ... year retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh she a dot com and see if you can score some passes there but there are multiple\nTypes of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of a hot topic out there what ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market\nRight now well the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design of financial trading plan a blueprint so to speak\nAnd again it doesn't matter what your background is what's your experience with trading is how much money you have it really is all about how committed you are you changing her life and doing something very very different hopefully you can see\nHow this can possibly benefit you in the long run but so many of our students have come in they had a lot of head trash emotionally thinking the only way they can make money which could be out there and work second or third jobs and again most of our students come to the academy because they're looking for freedom yes it's about making money we want you to make income but\nAt the end of the day what could that extra time mean to you do you have time to volunteer would you prefer to go part time and do a job you didn't want to do even example you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a single mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids to school very very nervous wasn't sure she could do this\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids to school but bought herself a new car so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one started ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach of all you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask cry and all that did was really earn you some extra money wouldn't it be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as give you that financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do is kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that they cost ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways now included with your half a classic\nOr income whether the markets are going up down or sideways now included with your half the class including with your pass is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now college tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved seats the number is eight five five\nEight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com and see if you can score some path of their\n... now Larry still kind of all this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down absolutely a little a lot of\nOur students have figured out they can use other types of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so there's great ways that students can protect their well they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to the three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for the correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down as an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. and it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all they did right now by spending three hours of your time it's help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it you\nKnow we always look at things in the investing world is richer award how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half their classes about three hours long so that's your investment that your total investment is three hours worth the time so\nSo even if you were to say that your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to the topic class\nBut the rewards are potentially winnable some pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give me that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are the most fun quotes the way I always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it as yours ... yeah I think that we say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all you want to Ryan's as you don't want to spend your golden years of the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the wherever these fun cliches saying that we don't have to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true\nRight we've heard him so many times 'cause they're sure nobody nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity rates in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary\nRight but it is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area not the costs really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways now including with your passes half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now that professional insiders kitten makes it so you get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight five five\nEight to five zero for for for that's eight five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up at Houston Ho Chi a\nDot com and see if you can force a fast as we got to take a short break we're going to be right back Larry whatever for the next\nYou know this is a lifestyle of a trade or a lot of people now are sitting here me interested in realizing they want to make ... make a change in their lives let's talk about what the effects are they\nGoing to fall back to current and show you what that looks like right\n[noise]\nIf you could invest just about three hours to open yourself to strategies that can make you financially secure for life would you do it\nFor over Twenty years online training academy is transformed lives worldwide with their exceptional trading and investing education and they would like to invite you to a free half day investing class near you here's one one reason graduate had to say\nMy training and had I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is making better trader a better planner I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nKid there Saturday because I'm I'm available now and working together and the family um I get my training Diane and die they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learned more visit it's on line at Houston O T H ... that Houston oh T. A. dot com\n[noise] men is Howard trading radio to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobson director instructor development instructor it online training me shed some light on retirement accounts were really talking about how to keep those retirement account growing whether the markets are going down or sideways\nAnd and one of the questions we're asking on that on that last segment a little bit out to your financial family or or radio listeners out there are you willing to do a little extra because really that's that's really all it takes you invest in three hours of your time to come out to a half the class and then and then putting it a little bit of extra time to make sure your nest egg make sure that retirement account\nIs growing whether the market's going up down or whether the markets are going sideways it really doesn't matter the market direction as long as you have the skills it doesn't matter if it's income for today and it doesn't matter of income for tomorrow and they're used one of my favorite cliche or things you want to make sure that we're not spending our golden years of the golden arches and that's really what this is all about\nBeing able to have that financial freedom and live that life really that you've worked so hard for and that really you deserve\nNow we want to spend a little bit of time pulling back the curtain on the day a day in the life of a trader so whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was near maybe you've been with us for the whole show will get excited the best is yet to come and and learn a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time for you know to add investing ad trading into their life\nListeners are not quite sure they have enough time for you know the ad investing ad trading end of their life I mean you know the thing I Would like to say there's only twenty four hours a day and right now we're using all of them the the other thing I was like to bring up is every time I see a movie\nTrading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication right when in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students that are just coming out on online training academy\nIs is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there more reactive something happens and they react to it which keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of the mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market then it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be right it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market\nYeah look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes ever about insanity definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again in expecting a different outcome most people\nLive in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book and go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching black and tell you what's amazing\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time as the only profession you can do this\nTraining where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that these cases are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nThose are

T reading on that do you remember that\nUm yeah it's the talk to 'em acceptable\nIn high ... a hundred a hundred twenty\nOkay All right so we have some breathing room there a sign air gas into they you know what that is\nIt's not bad yeah OK\nOkay good yeah we got to be careful of that\nSo first of all I'm you're at a gas it is not going to be bad for your swimming pool and improper dosages\nAnd especially on a pebble pool is going to help and keep it he'd been looking really pretty\nYes it's not good to leave that that ph eight point oh because not only does it it's not that you're going to use more chlorine in the early ... would you will but the chlorine is no longer as almost Neal as far as being a killing age it anymore\nIt's about less than twenty five percent and eight point oh and it's killing age it where it down at seven point for it's about Seventy five percent\nA Russia so so yes it is important we keep our ph down in the normal ranges which in Europe who I Would recommend to seven points for\nRather than seven point six because it's a pebble he wanted to it'll help to keep a the cinema dishes products that are leaking out of that plaster from hazing over and causing the the um\nThe the last year to get kind of a\nCreamy looking so uh I Would say how many gallons of water is cool\nIt's sixteen thousand five\nOkay and if you have\nHe's a pool it's sixteen thousand five\nOkay and if you have an eight point oh then don't be afraid to pour a whole gallons of acid into deeper part of the pool\nAnd maybe even walking around you don't want to pour it directly on the steps or a bench but you want a port in that area make sure the pool is on and circulating do you have an automatic pool cleaner in the pool\nYeah ... okay make sure that's running as well that'll help to get all that answered\nA\nCirculated all throughout the poodle quickly and so yeah it's sometimes if you're just pouring a little bit at a time then it'll rise itself back up now here's something else that I Want to tell you about it you might be interested in\nThere is a product called protein Supreme plus and a it's a\nProduct we though you're in Crosby you're not that far from from where we are we're in Pasadena and we do okay we do offer delivery service but ... but I'd love for you if you have time to come by bringing a water sample to my store in Pasadena Miller pools and we can airline out\nYou're not too far from that way I'm sure\nNo we're not we're about five minutes from the beltway that maybe two minutes [noise] um [noise] but ... bring water sample temp took to my guys because 'cause everybody I have in\nThe store there all they've they've been cleaning pools repair and pools they they're long term cool guys so we really understand the ... chemistry if I'm there I'll I'll come out and meet you as well\nBut the pro teams Supreme plug ins of bore a water a harmonize or meaning that when you put that in the pool it's going to make the water feel incredibly saw for you\nIs going to make a when your your hair and your skin is going to feel great but the great thing about it is it prevents algae from growing\nAnd when you get it in the right amounts a few ph is already locked in at seven point for it helps to maintain and keep that ph at that level for long periods of time\nSo it's really a great product for the swimming and it's really a great part for your P. H. which in turn makes your Korean work better and make sure pools safer to swimming\nObviously going to do that\nGood good you'll never really liked this product I have it in my own pool and ... had been using the boring for Fifteen Years or there are you liberate\nJammed up can I ask you another question\nYou bet you bet I got time\nOkay this is kind of want to do as well it all depends questions [laughter] I I don't expect that exact answer okay\nBut I you know what we've got a heater in the pool sixteen and a half thousand gallons and that's a forty thousand\nA four hundred thousand or ... yes it's a big one yeah um yeah\nWhat the average cost ... ... you don't you want to say Thanksgiving the pool up you've got people coming down from somewhere I'm what order of magnitude what is a cause and dollar a hundred thousand\nNo it's it it's in the hundreds or maybe not that many helga here's the deal I was just talk to my friend a complement camp of good good buddy of mine pool builder and a consultant now [noise] um he was saying that gas is six\nDollars an hour to run your heat or those four hundred thousand dollar heated four hundred thousand BTU heaters I'm eating my little right now I have a thirty thousand gallon cool twice the size of yours so unfortunately I'm having to pay out a little bit more but I'm using my pool to exercise every day\nAnd so it's worth the investment to me you're I used to have a pool your side sixty five\nAnd I did the same thing with that pool I'm tempted warm ... for ... I didn't hear all the time but I I Would do it for like Thanksgiving for like Christmas Time\nIt's not that bad a did yes there are dependent depending upon the ... the the water temperature and the pool depending upon how cold it is outside depending upon how windy it is outside all of that can contribute to how long that heaters going to have to run to maintain the heat\nThe key is when you're going to heat the pool\nMake sure the pompous running twenty four seven because you're you're if you're pumping only running eight hours a day and it heats up during those eight hours guess what happens over the next ... sixteen years does all that heat\nAnd when you when you can keep it going cost a little more electricity I'm sure you probably have a very low speed pope on that people will do you\n... you know I haven't noticed any changes in cost\nAll right but he has good um but I'm a\n... by keeping the pump running the heat or won't run that often once it reaches that temperature it's not going to run for hours and hours at a time it might run for five or ten minutes an hour so maintaining it is a lot cheaper\nSo let's say you want to start heating the pool on Tuesday evening so it'll be warm for Thanksgiving Day and you weren't going to keep it a war for the whole weekend\nThen you know you might be looking at a little over a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty dollars\nA year and I could be off 'cause like you said it's at the hands at the is that the pin question to me sure that is a a an easy investment because you'd start thinking about entertaining people taking them out to dinner go into a movie or you know whatever you're going to spend probably more than that\nAnd of course having the swing vote in your backyard well you already know how much fun that is\nWhat your kids outside of the house\n[laughter] investment right absolutely absolutely my kids are all grown now but we still have family with younger kids we love to have him into some of the pool it is a lot more fun\n[laughter] sure I really appreciate\nHey doc when you get ... you know I'm usually in the in the store in the afternoons so he could come by around three o'clock I'm usually they're ... they're\nOkay I'll ask you some questions about the corona beach fan\nOh ha ha ha ha [laughter] oh you you know the krona beach bad well yeah if I Will be glad\nWhat well you know I can tell I Know no disrespect the Coronado beach bad but my favorite bands used Wally Wayne and Dave\nOh sure no I I I Love all the way to Dave [laughter]\nWe used we used to um ... black sure when he when he was playing at Tamms yep I Know they go back we couldn't wait for him to get off the wall even they were quite\nYeah I talked to Dave just the other day\nAnd he's playing again and we're trying to because I started playing with those guys uh I I started following them to just like you did and then I said yeah I got to get up there and play with you all the way they we started playing together and we wound up being at Sam's flights every Sunday night for like years back\nThe other thing I could possibly be a crack to lead a little crack in your lead that you may not be seen are is the ... how old is this palm\nUh it's just three or three years old\nAnd okay so I doubt very seriously the latest cracked are the ... getting cracked either but sometimes that's a possibility\nAnd none of that is is is causing it then you're going to need to call I Would call Texan pools that you're out in Montgomery at two eight one three to zero eight two four to\nAh they came out and pulls to them okay good they they have a full service department as well and they come out and um and find out what's going on\nA and they may have to call for early detection where they're going to pressure up those lines and see if there's a um a break into line underneath the ground that would be no the next thing that it could be\nOkay [noise] so it it's one of those things David it's one of those things and and we always hope that it's going to be something above ground 'cause that's an easy fix underground gets a little more complicated\nSo if I were in the Home Depot what kind of like silicon would I be looking for\nJust ... it's just a hundred percent clear silicone just tell them I Need a hundred percent clear silica becomes ...\nOh does it harden up or is it yeah like a petroleum\nHardens up and he didn't come out of jail and then it'll it'll harden up so but you know like if you put it on while the pomp who's running it if there is an air like there there is a little separation there then it'll suck that that a silicone into that and then it'll it'll seal it up\nOkay here's here's another side of that is is whatever I pull out my filters and I really super clean them and get all of that cleaned up and put it all back together on my palm basket will fill up all the way with water and it will last a couple of days like that\nSo that that says that the um there could be some habitation due to back head pressure of the filter is dirty or if it\nRuns clean and all at any one time than I doubt that you have an elite and when we're talking air are we talking a lot of air or just a few bubbles\nAre we are talking or I mean it's\nYeah it's it's that throughout the water levels right at the top of the basket\nOkay and is the pressure high on the filter\nUh\nEighteen twenty well what's the normal pressure though Eighteen twenty ... high and that you know eight\nOr when he was a what a habit freshly cleaned and even when it was brand new uh ten or twelve\nOkay well the time to clean the filters and if if the obese cartridges\nThey are and they're three and a half years old now\nThat it's time to get new cartridges go okay go get your go to the ... go over to Texan pools they have on there or they have one in ... they also have one over in the ... not sure which one you're closest to you and\nTake the model number of your filter telling you want dirt master vi failed for cartridges and put new cartridges in there and I bet that is going to take care of your problem\nAnd so even though they're really not showing where they probably are\nThree and a half years old they you don't see how backed up they are you're not able to clean them any longer their stuff in there that you just can't see and then you start when you go with the dirt master ... every time you clean\nOr I Would recommend you using the jak magic D. E. and filter cleaning up a product because they've got to clean the cartridges better and um\nI recommend you get on an enzyme program they have several of the inside grams Texan pools and that'll that'll make clean your filter lot easier to buddy\nExcellent thing ...\nOh you bet David thank you for the call appreciate it hey cliff hanging on the line I got to take one more than other break here when I come back I'm going to talk to my buddy cliff the cabana boy he's going to tell me about these ... these are the master cartridges he's used them and\nI use them in my pool and I love them dearly figured if I may radio program she liked one five five eight five seven three eight pounds ... recall on your horizons Michael Miller and I'll be right back\n[noise]\nTalking with a buddy I Allah from survey on ceilings buddy what stones really need to be protected in our backyard and what have you got to help our listeners Michael all stone in is in\nContact with a pool whether it's your coping your day your water features fall should be protected with a sealer products like I said early on we balls for over three\nBasic type she got a natural finished which would be in his family you're in is eight hundred phonics during his two hundred and leaving my natural finished they feel like a nice enhanced flip and don't want to shine we have our our is eight hundred which is an extra product stopped so for us in Salt damage and so forth\nAnd then if you like the way it looks when it's when we have our wetlands products eater I W O three fifty or there'll be a one hundred are excellent choices for those type of stuff\nThere are these products that the homeowner could apply themselves\nHave ... they can be either rush rolled on her in most cases of pop ups for no problem\nIn available at all Texan fools Miller pools that is correct all the time you got a website where we can go look at the foreign actors\nOr if you have any questions Janine dating him so we should change or anything for the best farmers please business\nPolitically or if you have any questions unique data and so we should change or anything for the best parts please visit our website it's certainly on ... and see our video in SCA L.
