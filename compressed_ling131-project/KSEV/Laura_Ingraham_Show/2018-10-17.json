shopping I cook I energy all day I mean I feel great\nOverall my whole outlook just feeling about my medical aspect everything everything is better\n[noise] no absolutely not a lot actually sort of surprised it took this long for a cure event like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no constantly a hair bring the president's efforts to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals' that's your purpose and come to the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get released\nYou've got all that you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals ... states we need to cut off those Meg that's the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise]\nYou know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if I wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have an e verify and it has to be in for strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the letter detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families that their cases to be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases ... who knows folks can be returned to the United states\nWe can also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat used to be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states but then again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nThey do they should be applying for asylum in Guatemala they should be applied for asylum Mexico but they're not in addition they are the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a were accompanied alien minors has to be released after twenty days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they are\n... and it doesn't matter how many instances hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter I think it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heart string to America and put these Republicans back on their he'll say okay you want to put maybe can cage and do you want to punt baby how many times did we hear kids in cages kitten cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous weights robberies murders\nUnder the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as a border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any comments by their child traveled through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous journey states is beyond all\nWell when you when you see these\nFour thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this like ... there's no way when you have a per capita income of two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though\nAre you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they are given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably working their favorite this is another and said that the game you went back to eat verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their slug we're definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so that uh the cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some some came to my some measure of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case that that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of ... hundred thousand my God\nWe're in the United states under five orders for mobile they received their due process Laura it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states will continue to work here again we have we verify there's no way\nTo verify that there are leading in\nIce chips lack of resources to go out and find ones and twos eats of people [noise] plus you you put on top of that the century laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system or ... any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night aren't and he said that the folks in\nA Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know and the NBC traveling reporter who travels with migrants\nHadn't been coached yeah so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states and there are no jobs here and\nNever mentioned anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the called coaching really occurrence that's where you get you know there's a paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview you and so the script for everybody man woman and child seemed to be\nInterview you so the script for everybody man woman and child seemed to be the same and I fear for a fair for my family like I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and\nGang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that for a\nLand security bill I think of it so that bill [noise]\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five percent of all people who claim credible fear founded have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear of something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that of the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nBe H asked me to give that authority back to the Justice Department needs that authority back\nTo the HGF so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical core\nWell and also a fence and see or someone else made the point when someone claimed domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestically into my train of domestic abuse\nIt hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate a local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in order to review in\nTexas or Arizona just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place could actually prevents the United states government investigator whether or not that claimed took place in her country nothing that's contained settled applications can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum proceeding we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in these cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the GDP already the trafficking victims protection that we have actually a handover unaccompanied alien minors to a church as an agency a department of the United states government that really doesn't do\nThis for a for a living\nAnd yet you know Congress back in two thousand and two decided that ha church has this

I'm your host [noise] I've a\nFriend and they're doing um [noise] and assisted living center\nIn in my buddy that there is in first class was college what they've known him many many many years near buffalo speedway and loop six ten and they're going to build one right next to second Baptist church\n[noise] so what happens\nIs when you have a facility like that usually have a large number of what we called independent living units which means you have an apartment you can do whatever you want or you can have a you know you can eat meals there you can take guilt trips with a group you can do your own thing and then once you\nProbably age out of being able to live independently you get to assisted living and that's where people can come by check on you help you with your medicine that help you get dressed do whatever you need and then there's the time in life\nThat many of us would need what they called memory carrots all farmers dementia you just need intensive help [noise]\nSo where some places might have two hundred independent units they might have Seventy assisted living in thirty and memory chair\n[noise] so I asked my friend I said okay what\nDo you go into independent living before you need it\nBecause I almost think the majority of people I talk to and you'd have to answer this for yourself\nWhich say hey I Want to stay at home as long as I can I don't want to go to a nursing home assisted living I mean I don't want to stay home and have someone come take care of me\nAnd my buddies are trying to sell anything essential Steve\nIf someone goes in the independent living sooner they stay independent longer\nSo she said\nCan live on your own longer if you go into independent unit then if you stay at home and I said why I think that because it's all the social interaction because if you go into a unit in independent living you make friends you're still moving around you're doing things you take field trips\nAnd he said I probably wouldn't use is I Want to get him on the radio I might not use is on the radio he goes through your memory in college was captured he was like I'm like yeah you saw everybody cafeteria right\nAnd you'd sit at a table catch up with someone may become a different time catch someone else coming and going it was kind of the center of what was going on\nAt the center of what what's going on and he said it's the same way and independent living assisted living you know the cafeteria is a really nice place got quality food and you don't have to eat or you don't want but if you go down there or even one night a week the white table cloth or whatever\nUm you see your friends and you're in Iraq and their stuff going on and you might take a field trip you might play checkers you might need or needlepoint or you might just hang out or get together and go to the extreme and watch the\nAstros baseball game and it really does make sense to me and I'm not ready to go to independent living\nBut if you wait until the last moment to go to a facility when you need a lot of help you're probably not going to be out and be social in forming relationships\nI have a friend whose mom went into the independent living for years before she needed assistance\nAnd now there is an assisted living she needs a lot of help\nBut like people to come by to visit her all the time and when she's out she just knows everybody and she's already got relationships and it's been really your market will place for so anyway I Want to get my buddy on and talk about what is it costs out of work\nAnd that's what we'll be doing over the next two or three or four weeks so we kind of interesting\nOr no risk to any one five five eight five seven three eight so there's no time in every little boys like he wants\nTo be a train engineer and if you grow up to be a train engineer you get to blow the whistle right if the average incomes eighty thousand a year a typical job on the railroad today might start at forty thousand but within a year ago you could be making sixty thousand\nAnd in fact there somewhere was today that are offering twenty five thousand dollar signing bonuses for something that shows you gets a bonus after you've been there a certain period of time because there's a shortage\nOf labor two things going on one the economy is rocking and rolling and I don't know if you believe it or not if you censor but unemployment rates down to four point one percent of the United states in some places to point out\nUh the trains are moving a lotta a lotta merchandise and they just need a lot\nI have a new credit card\nTo chase sapphire reserves and I got it because I got a bunch of extra points when I signed up new at it a year so\nDoes it have the numbers on the front of the car the numbers are on the back\nOf the car\nAnd in fact credit cards today are trying to be more fashionable you know the word ... numbers and the color black is in and um they don't put the they don't put the raise numbers\nOn the front much anymore so ship that ship technology\nLet them move numbers the back um\nYou know and it's just it's kind of interesting a lot of their credit cards that mostly designer novelty there and every skill numbers um and they really just don't have the numbers anymore for it to function\nSo credit cards are very conscious about how they look I guess people when they fly out of credit card walk prestige [noise]\nI Do have an American express card and scream it works fine for me American Express I Believe they're most prestigious card\nIs they're whack card and they're black or imitation only\nIf you spend a hundred thousand a year on American Express I don't think that's enough\nTo get the black card\nBut the cool cards they have the day they kind of feel like metal you know the Upper East numbers the alpha play platinum and they're also black [noise]\nOur numbers to any one five five eight five seven three eight so I took an airplane trip the other day and

Internet it get it or at least you did but now that Netflix is available on Comcast their humanity and Netflix are probably going to be available and many other cable providers\nSo um\nWe're finally seeing a change in the TV world or getting close to the cafeteria plan so when I say cafeteria play and there was a traditional\nSet up you get cable TV or you get satellite TV you pay a hundred bucks or more a month and you get a huge number of channels you can produce a few but there's no way to get less than a hundred probably\nThe cafeteria plan means you pick and choose what you want you want to pay eight bucks a month for you and the you know maybe you just watch the networks Turner HDTV History Channel and you're done or not totally cafeteria ever really closer and closer to a cafeteria
