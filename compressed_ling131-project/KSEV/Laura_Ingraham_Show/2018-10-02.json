campus there trash they're called racists or a anti women are rapists\nFor trash they're called races or a anti women are rapists or so now now anyone who supports Brett Kavanaugh will be called anti

well in middle America I don't think\nIt goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or\nMaybe it on the college campuses speaking of the college campuses vis a Georgetown professor we're going to be delving into more of this a Republican senator should die miserably be said to pigs for supporting Kavanaugh\nAnd she has had a history of nasty comments\nAbout Trump's supporters uh and calling them all sorts of names and Raymond made a good point that\nCan you imagine if a professor who was an even even modestly a Republican said anything\nResembling ... the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWhat that would that slightly Republican professor survive\nProfessor wouldn't be run off campus not that there aren't many Republican professors anyway would be run off campus\nThat that's that's that's a that's hostility you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a well we already had one ... a male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment\nSimple comment about credibility and Christine Ford get into more of this but the double standard is just\nUnbelievable\nThe views of faculty members expressing their private capacity or their own and not the views of the university does that mean somebody express racist views on Twitter that that person would not would not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibit speech based on a person presenting ideas or the context of those ideas even when those ideas maybe difficult controversial or objectionable well faculty members may exercise freedom of speech\nWe expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor a Web site um\nSome interesting reviews of this particular professor teaching style\nCome up a\nNamely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this and a conservative it wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her class simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worse or lectures or never supported just presented unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor\nRating [noise] so this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor\nIn his private capacity tweeting support for Kavanaugh for anything and using the same type of language toward Christine forward supporters he would be fired they would figure out a way to run him off campus even if he were tenure that figure out a way to do even if they had to pay him they get 'em off campus\nDo you agree with me a five five forty Laura\nOr we'll talk more about this a and a woman who knew Christine Ford in ... at North Carolina state will get to that and a lot

how about you know get remember blacking out you remember getting drunk and how you behave in college and just\nHow about you know remember blacking out the remember getting drunk and how you behave in college and just always the presumption of guilt going forward in every way that they have questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nUh now describe if you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine Ford given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate right\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her ... friendship share but I was in her circles\nAnd I know the environment that she was on that we were all in especially our freshman and sophomore year we were partying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my point and bringing it up\nNot to blame her for her you know if she ... she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said\nIf you don't have any corroborating evidence\nThen you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing in college and you know we shouldn't be ... if you're going to grill or have no doubt that she also needs to be looked at as well because she had rain they accusations without any kind of corroborating evidence and can't forget that weight\nAnd she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that church sheltered changed the timeframe from being\nIn the mid eighties or early eighties she kept switching back and forth with it happened in college or that happened in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand the lawyer would grill her about that they wouldn't grill her about the details of hurt conduct\nHow we have to hold her with kid gloves\nRight then again ... minutes we're supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own and they're not a bunch of damsel in distress and yet\nIroned south right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap for moves forward in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a sex crime prosecutor who not political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear\nOr not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt what a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest I'm and she didn't she didn't like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that's so Trump traumatized church for four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and re decorating and you know we had\nHe had no emotion that corresponded with what she was saying ... the in trauma and horrors of it all was there would've been more anger\nThere were any more fear and passion and more directed she would detach she her anytime she ever talk about the assault she was very touching her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate dissociate when their rights and stuff that she wasn't right\nAnd this is thirty six years later and she said she has a PDF the which means that you're heightened awareness of what happened and so\nShe just did not she was not ... on feelings or fat but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts\nThe fact that measure up\nLived in an environment and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down but you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life\nIf we're going to bring this kind of thing out that the last minute wore a black we've got to remember the context to this right before the Supreme Court combination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that and then we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or or ...\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know these are the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by irrationality they've banned in fact they've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level it's all they have all their subject is kneeling and power\nAnd if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of object objective truth in order to have dialogue then the most powerful the biggest bully in the room that's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of bully\nThey're pulling everyone in order to advance their power in part of that's been ... there's always the struggle between that and what not that there's always the threat and if you're always a victim then you always have power over those who are trying to use you and\nYou know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on and different kinds of terrorists now what's going on in the tight relationship scare of men and women and it's working our country apart\nAnd we what this means that we have to let ... rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the NFL and then it is to round up all the guilty oh I'm actually the fact that just real life that that's what it's about being a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing play who lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you\nLook away from it that's a good kid just like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize

question\nAnd you know you can't answer that show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in a political fear then why should we ... we are not obligated

said look I'm Out of it and I've done all this thing but I just it's just ridiculous and I wonder before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the

out which one I Want off in the other two back or keep to send all three back it's free it's easy no headache and I love to shopping like this so I'm like wow well\nThen Amazon now has a way they'll so you close you try them you send them back\nIf you don't like them I was really shocked when other companies started selling mattresses online\nIn fact I work with the uh guides young couple fairly newly married and he bought his mattress on line you've got Casper lease a tops the needles will now than Amazon is doing their own mattresses\nSo you know being intellectually curious\nI wanted to say what is the best selling mattress on Amazon I never thought about bottom after some Amazon's\nHere's the number one selling mattress on Amazon and if you know the answer to this year beyond amazing uh I've never heard of it the best mattress on Amazon is designed this memory foam twelve inch\nGreen tea mattress\nQueen size how about that during the Seventy nine bucks so a tournament Seventy nine dollar mattress necessarily mattress on Amazon here's what's interesting about it [noise] um [noise] it's a conforming\nGreen he memory filed how 'bout that green tea memory phone they

of that who\nUp in the morning and said hey we make a mattress and they checked with green tea we can be the best selling for ... it was on well that's what they've done when Amazon does his own product now\nIt's called basics Amazon basics\nSo it's interesting Amazon is doing to their um to to many of the merchants of sill on Amazon to like walk retail stores have done to their suppliers so\n\nSo no one knew she had money well she worked for release more New York attorneys and when they would buy stocks you buy some too and they just hold it but she bought it and it's more about so let's do a little financially it's\nThe quiz question for you she worked or sixty seven years she bought stocks that's according to New York times\nThey probably did better but let's assume that the market average seven and a half percent over that time frame\nHow much a month\nWould you have to save to accumulate nine million dollars in sixty seven years or are you with me so that means every month for sixty seven years\nThat's eight hundred months eight hundred and four months how much do you have to say if you get a seven percent return to get the nine million\nThree hundred and Seventy five bucks a month so if I knew three hundred Seventy five dollars a month sixty seven years seven and a half percent interest it grows to exactly nine million dollars\nNow how crazy assess it should have got an eight percent of return instead of nine million everybody closer ten million\nSo the key on making money is to what do for a long time\nThat she got a nine or ... percent return it'd been over eleven million dollars so what I see people\nWho've accumulated a lot of wealth often they're really they're older and not only the older but they they've invested in the things that grow a lot they limit his lifestyle they love their money work\nNow if you're like my typical friends list there they're\nGoing well yeah I started to light\nGot why did I put my lawn and more money in Wal Mart or Berkshire Hathaway or golly ten years ago why did not put my four one K. and Amazon I mean we all wish we just say more started younger\nSo what do you do now when you start today what else do you do you start your kid joke you get your kids going as young as you can in fact if you can convince your kids hey look say ten percent\nA year on your first job first year raised at one percent a year or so you get the Fifteen Percent\nOh your first job first year raise that one percent a year or so you get the Fifteen Percent and you'll be wealthy some die before you have to do\nSo this lady accumulated nine million dollars in sixty seven years when I ran the numbers she needed to say three hundred and Seventy five dollars a month\nAnd that kind of amazing it's pretty cool and she lived within her means Hi Kelly Bell test on I think yesterday I went back looked at numbers yes beyond say and Jay Z bought an eighty eight million dollar house in California\nAnd they took out a fifty two million dollar mortgage they got the mortgage is all public record Goldman Sachs three point four percent it's adjustable Saudi and two thousand twenty to their monthly payments are about two hundred thousand a month so yes\nYou have the secretary in New York who accumulated nine million really living beneath remains than the reality and Jay Z the about eighty eight million dollar home and I know they have a lot of money I'm sure they do but they borrowed over fifty million bucks to do it\nIf you live in Texas you should be thankful that we don't have state income tax personal income taxes that's just a really really good thing so I thought it would be interesting to look at what states have the lowest overall tax burden\nSo if you look at great low tax states the state of the lowest tax burden is Alaska\nThey have no state income tax and in fact they pay money out to residents are they have for many years because of oil and gas income\nSo I I don't want to move there for low taxes it's still a little chilly for me also incredibly ... states or South Dakota Wyoming\nTennessee and then Texas\nAnd I think in general those are going to be mostly Republican states now what about the states with the highest taxes and it is not going to take a rocket science or a rocket scientist to you know to figure this out\nSo if we look at high tax states\nOn the list is going to be New York New York is liberal democratic and making sequence it ends but the average person there pays twelve point seven percent of their income in local taxes\nRight after that is Connecticut talk with six percent New Jersey wow will point to Wisconsin ... percent Illinois ... percent\nCalifornia loving person so I grew up in Illinois they have perhaps the worst credit rating of any state\nUm oh hold on I'm breaking news here hello\nAm I going to count quite mushrooms and acts like a graduation I hated my show signs of strain on your credit card account they can get my masters [noise]\n\nOne sister with me I got this call I got to take it you know I I I think they're going to offer me a low interest rate on my credit card\n[noise] like right\nNow that I have a question\nI Want to talk to someone you think they'll have an accent [noise]\nAnd they're going to say that they looked at my credit history and I've done a great job\nAnd all I have to do is give all all my credit card numbers\nHello hello\nOh man pillow\nThat Jim it\nI think they hung up on me oh I've been dying to get a low interest rate on my credit card I finally got a phone call during my show to work on it and they might have they might've heard my commentary and just gone away\nSo I Do have some very sad news for you concerning your cell phone and I know we got sidetracked but that was just an opportunity a really good and bad spots um it's estimated in two thousand Nineteen that half\nOf all phone calls made on cell phones will be junk phone calls\nIt's so easy to make 'em they spoke the number they come from overseas they have people over there that they pay you know three bucks an hour to try to get your credit card number so anyway um it it it looks like next year half of your calls you're going to be people that want to waste your time\nAnd that kind of a tragic thing\nThat's a really really tragic thing\nHair number one five five eight point seven three eight to eight one five five eight K. F. C. V.\nI mentioned a moment ago Illinois has the lowest credit ratings of any state they have one of the highest tax rates they have people leaving the state and going to neighboring states\nAnd they have trouble getting a budget\nTogether they finally got a Republican governor but he couldn't get together the Democrats run a lot of the unions run it out of Chicago um but anyway ... Illinois California among the highest tax states so there you go back to the lowest tax state\nNew York Connecticut New Jersey Wisconsin Illinois California they are among the highest taxed states so we do have a property tax hike property tax here which are aware of but if you're a high income\nIt's better to have a high property tax in the state income tax if you're low income with the really nice house and it's not good for you so it really depends on your situation on how the taxes affect us our number is\nThe right one five five eight five seven three eight [noise] to a one\nFive five eight ... levy [noise]\nHave answered these than one percent of all time high [noise]\nEuropean markets are flat Chinese sucks in the slums Japanese market\nAfter running off his back where it was twenty seven years ago [noise]\nSo how do you have to be done to international sauce [noise]\nAnd you'll be amazed at different [noise]\nSo what should you do [noise]\nI give you some things to think about it in a moment of socks [noise] get a number one five five eight five Seventy eight to says KFC easy money matters\nAnd he was a big believer in hiring people to help him if he could earn more working than what it cost him to do it\nSo I read another article recently that talked about how a lot of folks were happier instead of buying stuff to have someone to help them that would include mow the lawn do the laundry take care of things that the house run errands whatever you need to do\nSo a really kind of interesting thought if you make enough money that can be valuable I I think in ... and I have no data on this\nI think in Houston\nThat you're more likely to pay someone to take care of things because in the city it's easier to make more money and there's more traffic and there's more congestion and there's more um\nYou know there's just more stress so I was at a friend's house recently that lives in a small Texas town\nAnd he had bought an air compressor which would probably cost pretty nice what if you bought a new one it'd be three or four hundred bucks [noise] he bought it for fifty bucks and then he bought like fifty dollars for the parts any price ten hours rebuilding it making it work\nAnd in when we were talking I said was it worth your time and he said Steve I have more time than they have more money on my time and then he left the said if I were in Houston make it a lot of money I'd probably have more money in our daughter by new one\n[noise] so I think sometimes in the country things move slower you'd have more time and you just kind of work things out\nHere in numbers to wait one five five eight five seven three eight to eight one five five eight K.
