afford to spend limited dollars on our educate our education system from ... in the last twenty or Thirty years has gone from one of the best one of the worst\nAnd we'll just have to say that we cannot afford to take care of everybody in the coal to get here and if we do it's a crime against our own people\nAre kind of center are back or the ... in a sad thing I think for so many Americans is how it's become a point of controversy for you to say or any of us to say we want the border and force why is that controversial that we might border\n[noise] uh that uh we're gonna have to come to grips with the ... people\nAre I Hope or are observing this trying to figure out what's going to happen with their lives as this situation deteriorates or having columns people and leaders this or that you believe that I Know they call them the caravans but he's her columns of feeders coming to dark country\nNow admittedly most are probably good people below significant number are chronically criminals\nAnd no matter what it is we can't afford to have these massive numbers of people if we let them through this time and I I'm I have faith that are Brostrom will stop this a vision of our country\nThat ended up close and this time our we get except more and more and more of them just like we have individually as we let them across the border we now have probably twenty to thirty million legal eagles here\nOr are you being outspent significantly on any any add more than other outreach to voters getting in to the polls are online social media and so forth\nThat's there's the irony of all of this of course\nWe're being called because of our positions like on the legal immigration\nWere being called the establishment Republicans\nAre the party of the rich are being told but we've got these billionaires point money and like yeah I ... campaign and into all of the uh how do you say a combat or you're all over the districts that are in combat between Republican\nAnd Democrat they're cut their point of the guys are pouring in millions and ... hundreds of millions of dollars across the country millions and millions in in my district so it's difficult because uh I I Am not very wealthy man my owner [noise]\nA is a wealthy person and he came near you only been in California about six or seven years hit their country of money for his dad came out of your while I don't have the money that I spent on the campaigns are here it's a real challenge\nWe're close to where it goes to actually having no money left but we have raised over two million dollars to hire pulled its four and a half million dollars not to mention the Bloomberg type money that's coming into the into the race\nThe pets is ... a forty eighth district race in California\nA referendum on

illegal immigration a different president once or twice as well on on on major issues but most things like that on the president's side\nAnd I admire the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here however the the most important thing is\nIs up my opponent things you have a choice between myself and others and how the Democratic candidates are ... and she or he basically does he's a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand\nOf the things that other heart though on what it's like to be a just a this county of this country\nAnd I mean I grew up surfing on the beaches here and uh but uh I I went to high school here and in college here have at work here I Am so what it is is that it's\nThe president is an issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game to represent us a guy on the\n... part art\nYeah well there you know obviously in the ... years the is a it's quite a trophy and the Democrats can defeat you ah event in Fifteen terms I you came in at the strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning\nAnd are you an hour and that site with someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money who's\nChallenging the entire world view of a chomping conservatism has Orange County itself has seen an influx of a folks from Los Angeles\nAnd more liberal on planes of the state of California uh so what do you say to my listeners um congressman or our backer about\nWhat California has done wrong that could end up\nTransplanting itself across the United states extending across the United states\nWill ... part of our own or a big problem in California and of course uh it's it's now having a major impact on that say on our quality of life you have to look at things and and how pervasive this whole issue of vision of having\nMillions of non citizens come here illegally and doors in our society\nAre right our education system is going as go ... it's been a disaster for education system but we have issues that people talk about like uh how about the homeless\nAnd when you take a look a close look at what that means is there are a lot of people up our state for example\nWho are down in their life has to homeless people you guys have drug and alcohol problems but there are probably Africa people who are homeless who are people who don't go on ... ... they lost their job or something and they ...\nI don't go on ... ... they lost their job or something and they can't find a housing that that they can afford that they that they have the money to be able to pay the rent well that's because\nFor the last Fifteen Years what's happened is all the ... the low low priced housing that would be available like Craig house clean and nice living it has been taken up people here illegally and they built it two or three families\nSo here we have so much of our of our problems bill directly from the fact that the federal government isn't controlling the border\nAnd as I say here I think when people think about it All right thanks historically\nThere is successful I Hope you will be this person with a critical services and turn around the country and I'm just doing it\nAnd I want to play quickly for

believe that\nGlobal warming is real or maybe you believe it's not real some people do think that the ocean is rising some people do think that there are changes going on that cause more severe weather\nIn some realtors are starting to notice and folk shopping for houses when they say you want to be on the beat they're like no I really don't want to be on the beach I'd rather be three or four out then\nI have some friends that have a beach front cottage in Galveston but it was at the beach front cottage when they bought it there were one helps in that house blew away\nRather beach

a full growing season\nBut if things have warmed up it does now have a full growing season I've clients and friends that live in Steamboat Springs Colorado what has is perhaps global warming what is it done there well here's what it some\nHistorically you built a house in Steamboat Springs you did not have air conditioning\nEven the most expensive multi million dollar homes did not have air conditioning will today two things are happening one is people are adding air conditioning to ... and new homes are being built with air conditioning\nNow there's kind of a a kind of a joke that goes around in mountain towns in Colorado\nAnd the joke is is it gets so hot during a time in the summer that you want air conditioning you go out you get bids from the time you get your bed and you get it schedule it's cooled off again and you don't want the air conditioning\nSo I actually talked\nTo a friend of mind we went to an event and he ... he had a friend who was an ABC contractor who who left early and he said I'm so busy and so I ask you about air conditioning and he said Steve up here I get demand for it all at once but it takes me more than two weeks in solid\nPeople get over it and change their mind because it's sort of go off again I thought that was really kind of funny\nAnd how the world we certainly see trends I talked about some of these recently you know there's a time in Houston my dream would have been to have a two story red brick house\nThat would have probably been golly eighties they were building tons of those everywhere\nUm then it went to touch gun along the way you had stuck into some stuck it was bad yet stone and\nStucco today it's more what they called modern farmhouse wider colors a farmhouse without the frills a little bit of a frills in a little bit of a contemporary look\nIn Colorado When we were there we saw what they called modern mounted so you don't have a blog houses you don't have timber frame houses you don't have river rock on the
