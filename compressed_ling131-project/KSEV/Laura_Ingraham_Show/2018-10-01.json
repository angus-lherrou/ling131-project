wary of on it\nA judge is great to talk to my friend how are you I'm fine thanks how are you I'm very well um so your your take on\nThis reopening the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh there are some Republicans who say well this is a good thing because it uh gives cover to people like flake can\nCollins or to actually vote for cabin on in the end\nYou know this has been about um the light from the get go\nAnd I'm like what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this guy from from ... he said well this person asked for confidentiality um this could have been investigated by the FBI honoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted\nAnd um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nWanted it to me it seemed very obvious from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the air and screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprised me given the fact that the left believes that Supreme Court just another\nA super legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a social policy making body to the left and for them it's all abortion and ... and\nVarious social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary a judge\nWell um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be who gets appointed came to be so important that we just wouldn't judge just started I'm putting their own boss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's\nFrom a number of surrounding the other amendments I'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they can make it up but they want to walk and so I guess it very much matters who who's had his popping out from beneath the black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I've never heard of it she was on MSNBC over the weekend who\nIdentifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but then so be it neither\nNow so she she she know express something that I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here which is final title to this I did the hard\nWork and school and college and I deserve this I don't think that is not the case no one is titled to go on the Supreme Court and no one who is behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the way who hit on Thursday deserves to be an judge\nHere reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this and now the new standard apparently but not for a liberal conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side\nThat we had conservatives supporting Sotomayor and Kagan ... you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats year high school\nI don't know why why high school and go back to sixth grade wise just high school the\nLimit here but it it ate all reflects on your your\nCharacter and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful indiscretions\nPass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for that if you're a conservative you can never be regimes never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually may have some people on the record saying well\nWe saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judge it as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if you lose either way\nRight well how do you think that's ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interview that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast\nRight on President said the FBI can has free rein that's afraid to gay free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check and background checks are\nAre not about you know and I ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence with their background investigations and the interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise]\nYou know the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying\nWell he's yeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation and [noise]\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now\nYeah what we're going to be judged on I just I don't know who want want these you know the nomination I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly you didn't have something to drink and high school or college\nYeah I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly you didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just to\nHave it for and right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nStupid at all because you're you're you're um UK is all about the range of us did\nNo um [noise] if there's anybody who would be willing to have every day of of as you've um penned up on a wall and examine that that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um [noise]\nThe American bar association a supposedly ... was improperly reported early on or that the ADA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh what's you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out that\nThe president of the of the AP I pick up a pen and editors let her head and wrote something he wasn't authorized to write um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nAnd he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton\nUh and so you know again and he still reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and written reporters don't do their work all of this is ... that's really bad\nAnd now courts would find out that that's all all not true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back in the sand and you're listening to the lord and grim show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in chime in a ear reaction to what he did on friday and his appearance\nAt the global citizen festival with a with his friends senator Coons and also on on his appearance on sixty minutes on Sunday\nHe's enjoying his little waning power that someone has power over you they think they have power over you they enjoy that\nThat there are certain people that like exercising power over others and they take advantage of it I think that this is last gassed and he's enjoying every man I don't\nWhat are the chances that we are going to be in exactly the same place a week from now\nLiving in a child so we knew that sense of our colleagues said that that will be back here one week from now it'll be worth\nThe Laura Ingraham show\nLearn more at a N. dot com slash concussion ...

drinking should not condemn a person for life flooding ten said he was concerned about having a statement under oath\nHe said I have direct and repeated knowledge about drinking and it disposition while drunk and I do believe that Brett's ... actions as a fifty throat uh fifty three year old judge matter if he lied about his past actions on national television\nAnd more especially while speaking under oath I Believe those lie should have consequences\nSo he's he's both he he's both a judge and the jury here so this uh this classmate\nLetting Chen or as a do we know is is politics is

I mean\nI Know so I'm I'm not I'm just not going to buy it I'm not I mean if I Can't do that if I Can't borrow more than that with you that I'm\nJust I just won't do it so since the house for sale in Florida\nThat you also could not be involved in okay so in Hillsboro Beach Florida there's a mansion they'll play a vista the first listen to that in two thousand four team for a hundred and thirty nine million\nSo like I should have bought it then because it was a deal and it wasn't quite done and I could have put my own touches on it okay so in two thousand Fifteen they raise it to a hundred and fifty nine million\nAnd now they're going to auction it so that in my stomach turn\nYou know what I mean our families get along well\nBut if we can go in with you feel like maybe\nMaybe a bathroom in the bedroom\nYeah and maybe a hundred and twenty other families um and then here's what we get hit sixty thousand square feet\nSo football fields like you know just over forty thousand square feet I'm not counting the insides I'm twenty two bathrooms then we'd be busy cleaning the bathrooms when we\nAre [laughter] IMAX theater when the car garage a heated infinity pool not one not to not three but six waterfalls too deep water dogs at some of the ocean you get a big boat up there\nAnd they said look this or construction cost is over a hundred million and the guy wants to sell it because he doesn't have enough time to spend the house\n[laughter] so [laughter] getting lost in the house so not protected because they can't find its way out\nJust say you can't get out you can't get out so I think I'm\nKnowledgeable about white people build\nBig houses just because you know I built a few not not anything that its biggest sixty thousand feet a ha ha um [laughter] but I don't know Russell do we have to take a break can I hang out with Kelly what do we want to do here\nI've got a couple of minutes keep telling here we go okay Shelley so\nUm [noise]\nLearn something from a man that built about three or four million dollar home\nHe said to me and there was this plan he said they designed it for a year they spent two and a half years building it they wanted to live within three to four years and then sell it\nThey wanted to live within three to four years and then sell it and he said it could take two years to sell and so I said why would you spend two or three years building livid at three or four in two years\nSelling it and he said we love the projects\nYou said it's exciting we get up every day we meet with architects interior designers you pick things out you make decisions it happens and then he said we want to enjoy it but we don't want to enjoy to the point that needs remodeling\nWe want to sell it while it's fresh\nAnd let someone else to deal with that do you think that's kind of interesting\nI did because I think when you build and not price point people lining their own specific case then I just\nWould worry that somebody did not like my taste or you know and would want some specific and not dollar range than you'd be stuck with it [laughter]\nSo if you build something though to resell it hopefully your interior designer\nWould be designing for what the current and all I mean you you could have a little ... ads but overall you'd probably want to be mainstream elegant super classy\nYeah I think ...\nSo some people like the project studies have shown that if you spend money on like a project two or three times it gets easier to do it [noise]\nOh I Believe that I think I can perfect so many things I did on my remodel\nYeah and then what happens when we did our first three model everything was like five hundred dollars\nWill today I think everything's five thousand bucks admit or more um [laughter] so\nSo but once you do it it's just easier to spend the money to spend the money to spend the money I think some people love the project some people just have the money and they want a nice house that's ... that's awesome some folks really want to have\nThe best of the best of the best\nThey yard for they dreamed about it they won't be happy without it and and I don't know part of that social pressure but usually once you're in and you pay property taxes three or four times you sober up some\n[laughter] so yes he did [laughter]\nDo you go what have I done so I\nHave a ... in a friend\nThey bought our ranch style home in a really nice neighborhood and then it's been over a hundred dollars a foot remodeling\nAnd it's a twenty four hundred square foot house for two hundred and forty grand they did everything cabinet sewer rates ceilings small edition new kitchen new countertops new flooring but\nJolly a few hundred sixty thousand square foot home\nI Can't even imagine what that level finishes what would that cost three model into or Fifteen Years\nExactly I tell you what do I do find and especially out here in the north that finished updated Homs cell and there's multiple offers the ones that had not been updated our city longer\nOh there's no question so I talked to someone this\nWeek this past weekend and she's trying to sell her house and it needs updating and in fact I I'm just guessing but I think it might have turquoise appliances orange red\nCarpet and in bright green Formica\n[laughter] that would allow [laughter] that would turn some people are sick [laughter] I Need to mind\nI liked the fact that my house had not been touched I had\nPink carpet there was blue ribbon wallpaper was tickled cabinets I don't know if you're a member of the pickled cabinets that there is pickle cabinets and the kitchen but I Love the fact that I let him carrying out somebody's you know update and it lasts original and we could start from the ground\nSo why would you get rid of pickle cabinets and the carpet\n[laughter] just not my style Steve [laughter] so\nBut this this lady said he'd remodeling no one even look at it\nBut ... why the governor client who bought a house\nHe looked at twenty house in the in in two days and he bought the house that was the easiest cleanest no headaches so contractors\nHe paid a premium that came in and said man I saw a potential I saw deals but he goes my license away too short to deal with all that so I think you're right I think in the house has finished that it shows better that it's going to sell better\nI think that you and I will say that there's so many ... you know remember when the market and we had the credit crisis and the housing market share well now all these banks are coming back with construction\nPrograms and remodeling programs and said it's a lot easier to find that diamond in Iraq and you might get it at a good value and the kind of an inch and picture special touches you in finances improvements now and um there's a really good products out there for that now\nSo how often\nWhen somebody re models and you do remodeling shows all the time\nThat I've done some a fair amount of tear apart and redo\nWhat percentage of the time you think people go over budget\nI Would say Ninety percent of the time [laughter]\nSo I talked to a contractor and he goes look people want high quality low cost and fast he said I can do to out of three\nI could do high quality but you got to give me a lot of time I'll do it with um free or\nI'll do low cost you know I mean I mean you just said look you can't have all three unless you play up\nYeah I agree I agree to live and go ahead\nI was just so many people feel like that you know ... you can go to the bank and even after bank to give you the money for the improvements most of these programs are set up to where the bank\nOr work with a contractor and we will give your contractor than money and\nSays you have to get a contract if you're looking at one and he's done and the rats than you think okay hey look I Need a fifty thousand dollars to go in and pray that that's the way it needs to be in print before I can and then\nTalk to a contractor out there and get bad so quickly and figure out if it if it's doable and then just bake conscientious about what you're doing to the property and make sure the praises\nOf perfect sense so innocent I guess if you get home improvement loan and you're halfway through and you eat a lot more money you can always get more money what you set it up is that right\nI'm Kelly it looked like a brand new kitchen so there are ways to save money people are good at it the realtors should be really really helpful um\nThere had been a lot of the studies that say when you sell your house the first people who look at it for probably your best prospects because\nThey're in the deal flow they're looking at their neighborhood they're following ha are you know you have something they want\nAnd it's really important knocked over price and scare those people off to some people would say oh well they could make me an offer I might find someone stupid that will pay the price will get swat\nIt probably won't work that well then we were shopping for houses once and I found the house and I loved it I just loved it but it was it was just over our price range and then sold a year later\nAt a price I Would have paid get paid a price to like that to begin with they\nWould they would have sold it to almost ...
