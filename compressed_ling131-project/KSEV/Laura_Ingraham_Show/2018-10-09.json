and she uh now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought Yeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all that news outlets and MSNBC and CNN it's it's weird that\nIt's it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you and Hannity and Tucker at a handful of other people excluded or the exception but\nAlmost everyone's on your side and you're claiming

and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that and like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage\nAll the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour\nAll this stuff that wasn't

going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\n\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC and NBC\nThat's where he gets as information and he'd legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with Kavanaugh mhm and that's to me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all the information and it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice but draw these conclusions he couldn't he couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right ... an objective kind of understanding and it's this is Kevin ... opinions you wrote three
