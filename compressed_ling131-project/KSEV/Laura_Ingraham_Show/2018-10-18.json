being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris Cuomo a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino in his ... his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including its immigration policies on CNN is just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I Want to see it as a model\nHe I Know when I get on CNN after defending the president I get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain schemes gets the same kind of feedback\nFrom CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing them for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're ... or the ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living\nTry and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and they like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally\nThey want to open borders its it's beyond clear and I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop them this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nAnd to learn now with Dr germ and coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington right during the Reagan years\nAnd you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and have backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president\nLike Donald Trump have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve and confirmed Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore and Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOr chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh uh illegal immigration with immigration and they tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch bucket to work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration um shows that most people want legal immigration\nEither to remain the same and that's a million people a year and a lot or or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from Jim I'm thirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased\nNow that's legal immigration and those are the convenience factor inconvenient facts that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration seven affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call and I would say a legal immigrants for for a job and find that the wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent laugh so you know people don't want that\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a very blue collar area and\nAh in recent year a year or so we've seen\nTruckloads of illegal illegal immigrants a raft of a seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash\nAnd he just got a found guilty the other day of this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in\nWestern New York in Buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here need these jobs me these jobs and and they they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nLike them on this issue talking about how important are ... immigration and for the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration he's against illegal immigration\nAnd and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process or the first immigration process and then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nAnd the problem she sees is surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... ...\nIt's an it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly you if you can't even blame you can't blame the people\nAre trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own government incidents was one way shape or form\nA and they've been told you can come in fact\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right up border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigrants\nTo help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the cats at the at the border is is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of having a\nA and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\n[laughter] it's true and if your listeners white\nWhat they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings are the people running down the are always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nIn an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house because\nLot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call a deplorable right the people who haven't voted in recent election because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration waking up their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone for a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or\nThey don't you know a skip the or the birthday party after work to go vote on it and and this time around they better do it because they think part of the president's now about he is\nNot my us now ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently\nAfter it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he declares of innocence from you know we believe there's sort of and stuff but you're twenty seven as an hour plus eleven district with a safe seat\nAnd uh they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kind of lead and for the Democratic socialist I think really ate Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment\nAnd he's changed his tune because lived here for New York twenty seven is very pro Trump and now the Collins has been in some federal trouble he changed his tune and talked about how he wants to work with the

ask for the campaign was going and then people just kind of circled around I guess [noise] um [noise] one young man was asking me policy questions and then told me about himself he ended up on a yard sign so we I gave him one\nAnd then another gentleman entered the conversation and had a lot with a back and forth\nSeem any thing to be worried about my at the time I someone said something to my rights and I was talking to that gal over there\nAnd the next thing I knew he yelled out a political statement was something to the effect of you believe in people don't give a belief about the middle class and he just sucker punch me I didn't see it coming\nAnd I was getting hired taller chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember oh my gosh that and I could tell you it was a very big guy\nDid or did he\nHave earned it and um they didn't catch up with them two days later I'm found him he basically told them that are ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\nHe the jeopardy ask them\nDid you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him and his answer was no and then the deputy asked him do you know where you had him and he said yeah right now right now\nSo is he arrested for assault\nThey have been arrested in New York charged and yet they're waiting for the uh to

that we weren't like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but considered you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is is like I said before it's not something I was signing up for\n\nWell Shane a first of all\nThe left is trying to\nIntimidate good Americans like you from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of the rings physically prevent you from running and this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim oh we're not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where\nAre they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if\nThe ends are in their mind justified noble so that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble in the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a social spending framework voice that on the American people\nAre all the goals of of of\nMore of a democratic socialist approach to governance if those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there I uh and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted\nTo the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him\nFor what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI I really don't um I I I've heard a few things sense or\nI guess he's ... he's in the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about um Mm I guess knowing what occurred when they get to be on that we\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nThat you know I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday annoy had come out and publicly denounced it um I Will say that my Congressman Tom emmer he did call me a soon as you heard about it\nThe first time they've ever called me but it and you know give me as a ... of the support and all that I was you know\nBut but other than that no none of none of our representation and hire people have come out and set up to the to the last I looked at me way imagine if you were to be the ... the the thing that is the norm now it just you know go out and\nLike you said getting their faith kick them when they're down with other comments or I got tore up are using that exact lining up Facebook response\nOf calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually starting a local publication as my understanding that Howard ... their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota\nI don't know if they don't think we don't have radio in the deal here\nWas [laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we can't come Hillary Clinton let's say a go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent a\nRight yeah well and of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is that of course it has an effect\nAnd it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes but again they they they attempted dehumanize entire groups of people\nLike if you're a conservative and Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre ... you imagine what they would have done chain is a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance\nAh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say for conservative I'll just give the gender that is a conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't mind you know for one thing I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely cats\nI can say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and I you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a poli opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact they would tease each other you know let's go cancel each other's vote I mean it's I guess that that this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just\nThat that that this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and battles it says\nIt's a it's a fad places where you become actually\nA chain how does your race luck\nOr in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a strong Republican district that with no fortunate part is we do have an independent that shot the geo endorsement and granted independent bike\nRide from that but the downside of that there's a I mean the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this says I tried to tell them I only have three weeks of campaigning left and I ... I went out and get an event on Tuesday and I paid dearly for yesterday so laying low is probably the more important thing right now\nWell you gotta get surrogates out there for you you got to get friends in surrogates out they're few and events because you've got to win the state you got 'em in the house seat\n[noise] um ... that's that's a months so you got to get friends out there to help you what's your website Shane\nShane ... dot com and it's not going to spelled M.

matters [noise] time last a long time for us this morning for your ...\nLike and I will be with you today and Monday on Wall street today stocks are broadly lower ... it's been a bumpy ride these last couple of weeks\nBack a couple of days last week this week we had a great day on Tuesday coming back down today so that's just the way it is you know this is this year it's been just more volatile and the market overall but it's really more like how the market normally is\nYeah it's a little bit more back to normal kind of been loathe to sleep by these last few years of kind of you know straight out maybe there are down one percent one half percent day down three percent can be a little shocking when you haven't seen it in a while\nBut you know on average there's actually three down three percent or more days a year in stocks which you wouldn't think that ... going through the last several years but it's a it's a little more like how normally is but we\nAre talking about all the financial today we do invite you to call and get in where I had to wait one by five eight five seven three eight to eight one ... ... s e the Blake\nI don't know if you saw but the mega million jackpot is now a record high the drawing on friday and going to be projected to be on a hundred and sixty eight million dollars\nSo that's for the the\nAnnuity payout option the lump sum would be roughly I think like half of that that's not the largest lottery provides in us history back a couple of years ago seven sixteen the Powerball hit like one point six billion dollars\nAnd I played that one played that one I I couldn't I couldn't talk myself out of it I was like one one and a half billion dollars I mean that's\nAt some point it becomes work [laughter]\nYou're losing out if you don't at least try that's right so the power the mega millions\nStarted two dollars there are a twenty four overall prizes or no sorry you have a one and twenty four chance of winning something\nRanging from two dollars so your mind back to the jackpot the and the odds of winning the actual making millions jackpot are one in three hundred and two million three hundred and two million yeah\nThat's a lot ... there was some long odds so you know the so uh\nThat's a lot ... there were some long odds so you know the so ah you know the rockets gains after games that use it as a lottery on the home lottery what is it like a raffle Neal where everybody pays ten by you know you pay ten or twenty bucks split it had to charity\nYou have like astronomically better odds of winning that than winning all the the lottery well because they pull a ticket writes somebody there is actually going to win so it's just yeah I met her that's true to the total number of tickets to the one point six billion dollar prize a couple of years ago would split three ways for them\nOr have to split it three ways but we'll see if if anybody wins on friday if not the neck strongly Tuesday so two times a week\nDon't take the better odds of as us claiming that you need to go to all the rocket faster and play the lottery as as your strategy um but you've got better odds than that in fact you're four times more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to win the lottery four times more likely a\nWhile and it that's like the big prize right yeah that's right and when there are lots of there's you know lots of tens of thousands and even millions of dollars in bribes as I was reading something the other day that out a whole lot of those actually go and claimed\nLike if someone wins if they they don't really I guess realize it until they see on my mind I didn't win the ... the the all five or six numbers or whatever and just throw away the ticket and don't realize they're missing out on like Fifteen thousand dollars\nWow yeah I mean I'm sure\nYou know I'm sure it's easy to be like oh why didn't win so I didn't do that but you still go get your ticket checked 'em so growing up it was a tradition in in my family and my mom's side of the family\nThat my grandfather puts scratched shops in all of our stockings like that was just like the fun thing we did and I don't ever remember anyone winning more than like twenty five dollars like no one ever hit it and\nWe each had like ten scratch off every year for like Eighteen years over the course of like seven or eight family members and ... and never never translated\nInto any winning it's always fun you know whenever the stores pop up up up up every once in a while and let go at or near record levels it's always fun to think about ah if I bought a ticket and one what would I Do it's kind of interesting to daydream about that even though the chances of that happening are very very very very slim\nESPN has a new streaming service called ESPN Plus which states signed a deal with the boxing kind of blocking promotion company where they all stream fight as well\nSo canal Alvarez biggest single contract ever I I guess this is the biggest public one 'cause I feel like it's understood that LeBron James has like a billion dollar lifetime contract with Nike or\nSomething like that I Swear that that [noise] but I guess it has to you know I guess this is not technically an endorsement deal so maybe this is like pure liar his services adds an athlete I I I think that now as an endorsement maybe that's the distinction\nSo mellow ever as basically just won the lottery [noise]\nWell um\nYou know you always you always see the contracts you know like man good for you good for that guy like he was able to convert into town and the skills to to\nDo that the man that just seems like an astronomical\nAmount of money in this whole transition and train towards streaming has has really amplified over the last few years I mean direct TV Now now is now streaming service it's very popular link TV is the leader they've started doing\nCommercials during sports shows and\nEvents and all different things play station has when YouTube has one I mean they're all over the place now\nBut what what\nWhole segment is now seen is that they're not profitable and offering all these channels that you know Fifteen twenty dollars a month just wasn't enough so what they've started doing\nFor these ... bulkier packages that offers sports and things like that as the prices of all starting to go up and the value proposition that they used to have against traditional cable isn't quite there so now directv had\nTwo segments they have their direct TV Now which includes sports packages ESPN Fox freaking watched the NFL NBA Live things like that but there's a segment underneath that which is watch TV which like Fifteen dollars a month as opposed to\nI'm thirty five dollars a month and they're like this is a profitable sector because they're not they're using national syndicated shows or not having to pay for sports which are a huge the biggest a car yeah with cable\nSo they're having to figure out like what's the the right value proposition and what's the right customer while still trying to expand content and attract more people but with these\nYou know YouTube's prices now forty dollars a month and you can get a hundred and twenty five TV channels in broadband service for Seventy dollars a month with costs\nChannels in broadband service for Seventy dollars a month with Comcast or you can get slower Internet for forty dollars a month\nWhich is the same price and you get TV and Internet yeah so the value proposition at Fifteen and twenty dollars with huge and as these sites are expanding and trying to be profitable now they have market share you're just not seen\nAs much value in cutting the courts used to so quarter cutters be where you might be paying more than you think you are in the value might not be there that might be time to switch back to cable as opposed to the gym and optimistic money\nPut it back on I I Know people that like have like Comcast or something and no I still keep their modem and their cable box and then they'll just turn it off and then like during sport like football season or for the NBA playoffs will just say hey when Trump came back on and they'll just be a combination of turning right back on\nYou know I can see a lot of value in doing that because I Want to watch college football I Want to watch the NFL I Want to watch the NBA playoffs but those are really like probably the only three times that I Need yeah cable TV [noise] um there are some excited by without it I don't know I'd have to look at that\nOkay so I have I have a couple of of one shot urge we're talking about you know the lottery and different money propositions and I found a couple of\nJust interesting stories out there on ways people were trying to make money\nSo probably the most ridiculous to me and we'll start there and we'll get a little bit more reasonable was the Six Flags in Missouri is holding a coffin challenge requiring gas to stay in a coffin for almost thirty hours straight gosh so\nI mean I feel like I'm not a claustrophobic person\nThirty hours three hours is a long time they're not allowing cell phones nothing like that going on around they allow a six minute bathroom break every hour oh so it's not you're not locked and they're not like that so ... so it's fifty four minute increments they didn't find it for ...\nIt it seems it seems much more reasonable but you're like you know kind of like tilted backwards against a wall you're not like laying down or I don't know it's kind of weird you're in a two foot by seven foot um what they call slightly used coughing\nI think that just means they've done this before yeah um they do provide meals and snacks and you know you get the six minute bathroom break every hour but\nYou can have like a a buddy with you during the during the day yeah but it wants to park close is the only people left their far [laughter] are these people and the confidence along with um\nThe caretakers [laughter] so it's during their fight fast so it's all the people that are dressed up as their um you know frightening characters\nYou know what they call their fright fest freaks so those are the people letting them out of the ... every ... minutes you could have aware Wolfers zombie or your ranking science monster opening your crept in letting you have to go to the bathroom\nIf you ... you know if you complete it to you when to season passes you know tickets to price fast VIP haunted house passes\n'em and you get entered into drawing to win three hundred dollars\nIt doesn't seem like it's worth a day not yeah three hundred dollars but I mean maybe if you just love Six Flags and you get season passes it's where the\nAverage that'd be so boring it I don't I I think I Would pay for the season pass I don't know I think it would be called as costs her phobic if you're if you're getting let out for six minutes every hour\nThink about like our twenty more like an endurance that yeah you're you're bored out of iron you're tired I mean I guess you could try and the app\nI'm sure you could but\nI don't know it would it would be a struggle I I Can't see myself doing that but it's a it's a really interesting kind of gimmick they're doing\nUm another thing that people have started trying to do very unsuccessfully is to get rich off of scorpion venom [laughter] scorpion venom is the most expensive liquid in the world\nIt Carter like ... the volume yeah Jay costs thirty nine million dollars per gallon wow necessarily nine million dollars a gallon\nSo to get a gallon of scorpion venom you have to milk one scorpion two point six four million times\nOkay so you know\nA drop the size of a sugar grand Newell is worth a hundred and thirty dollars wow\nI'm In that's a you know that's about how much you get per milking of scorpion yeah traditionally it's done by hand by human and um and the chances of getting stung the our\nHighest you do it long enough and they say why one sting won't kill you it's easily a hundred times more painful than it be staying ooh\nSure certainly you can do some my gloves or something that I'm ... I'm sure I'm sure you can't I mean you would have to but gosh a hundred times more painful than to be staying that's gonna that's gonna ruin your day um but the reason it's so valuable is one that's rare and hard to\nTo secure yeah and they've discovered a lot of medical benefits from the venom declare road toxins in their combined with cancer cells in the brain and spine and can identify the specific size and location of tumors\nThey've also used the venom to eliminate malaria and mosquitoes\nIn the ... toxin has been given to Iraq to fight bone disease and scientists are hoping they can develop it to work with humans as well\nSo they're just beginning to understand the medical benefits of this and they think there can be more and more researchers in Morocco just invented a machine for milking scorpions that can look up to four scorpions at once\nWow that they're hoping to mass produce I Wonder how like how what the turn over time is for one scorpion when you can milk it again yeah how often can you milk a scorpion\nThat's that's something that I don't think people would be able to answer for me but\nI think so you know we had the bitcoin bubble and now we have kind of the candidates oil bubble watch out next the scorpions are above all coming up that will be next year\nWe might call and we're at two one five five eight five seven three exits is aimed seven hundred K. F. C. V. [noise]\n\nButter last couple of years some African countries like Kenya and Uganda have actually banned the importation of second hand clothing from the west because it's the press has their own clothing industry that they have their it's cheaper to go you know get the second clothing and go buy from a local manufacturers or any facts or\nA an interesting economic dilemma yeah but it's not easy to it's not necessarily easier to talk a lot of this stuff sometimes they turn in inflation if the fabrics are mixed which a lot of times you know you have polyester with cotton together or it's more complicated separate if there's a zipper\nOr buttons they have to be separated from the start first or closing for ... before they can get rid of it\n[noise] um is it you know at this was all from an interview with the guy who was in ... who works in a fashion school\nUm he said he remembers\nGoing to it there was like after a show at ... you know like sample show a lot of people that don't do shit new sample shows 'cause it you know they don't want to sell the think secondhand for let's expensive and people were just cutting up\nThe employees were just cutting up perfect ... and we're making blankets that they auctioned off for charity [laughter] oh\nSo anyways I that's something I had never really thought about it but there's just millions of dollars every year and high end clothing that shift\nBut in a landfill when the watches to someone who has ... that's what crazy to me that's fascinating that you're like yeah I mean do you want especially with the watch which would be called at a time peace in that situation would be a collectors' item and when you are you one way and\nI'm going to guide off year does they watched become a time these [laughter] I don't know if that gets a price for it [laughter] not a definitely don't have enough time for you [laughter] that's funny um [noise]\nYeah I mean just the the idea of of throwing them that much waste in any industry you know should just be be recognized by the public and I'd I'd never heard about that so it's really interesting to me\nWell Blake the talking about retail some we always hear now there's retail apocalypse brick and mortar going away everything going on line\nWell there's one retail company that is just thriving and growing their sales growing their profits and that is tractor supply company so tractor supply company has you know at the eighty year old business they have um\nSeven ... open seven hundred and twenty three locations just in the last six years\nIn plain open five hundred and more of the next ten years their profits are increasing nine percent annually there a same source sales have increased for eight consecutive years\nThis was interesting they collect turned fifty seven dollars in sales per square foot of the store which is thirty percent more than like what makes his dad's\nUm so it's one like the true actual like remaining grow stories and brick and mortar retail out there that's not saying that they are adapting at all they do have online things people can order someone might pick it up and store they also have evolved into content\nSo they're like doing yeah why videos\nOr um you know how to how to brush your horse those kinds of things it's kind of funny that it or what they'll do is like they'll be like a beekeeping video and then they'll see a bunch of people kept on this\nAnd then they'll add that store they'll stop with bees and became the beekeeping equipment but they're really like a niche retailer and that's where we've seen a lot of ah the brick and mortar that have\nStores that have you know still thrived recently is there and kind of a niche thing if you need to go by boat feed Amazon I don't know if they have goat feed and so you probably have to go run the tractor supply a lot of that stuff\nIf you're working on a water pump or that kind of thing people still like to go walk into the actual story and talked to somebody about it um it used to like you I'm a hardware store I mean Home Depot still actually doing fairly well I'm On its own but they kind of\nAmazon and some of the online retailers haven't quite caught up to that kind of\nOf a\nNiche product next niche product raw specially when you're working on a project in you're not you know you've got a good idea on how to do it you've got to you know you think you have the skill to get the project done you're building something or doing something with\nPlumbing you should probably want to run it by someone that's make sure you find the right stuff and the right part so the advice part of it I think is huge\nUm but yeah retail the you know there are certain segments that are shrinking rapidly other areas that are growing so it's interesting to see the sit back and forth going on where we invite you to call in or line has to wait one five five eight five seven three eight sweat won five five have KFC these [noise]\nWe're so they don't show started doing mind I'm a leader on conservative talk radio am settled Hubbard chaos or you read\nFor many years of pine box has been helping families gain insight into the often

just shift a shift gears a little bit from retail talking about some of the the changing trends in in travel and\nYou know once and I are firmly in the millennial age group and millennials constantly like to spend their money on experiences and engagements more so than things although the fact that people are now buying sixty garments\nI'm a year the post ... Ga Ga garments a year if that kind of throws a wrench into some of that thinking [laughter] um but they're cheap [laughter]\nYeah we're just going to buy fifty aging him T shirt so we have to throw in there and buy another fifty I'm so that the Indian people think that it's cheaper for us to burn our clothes than it is to wash them\nUm anyways ...\nThere's been\nA change in the way cruise lines are structured they're starting to get much more focused on the luxury market\nIn fact the fastest growing\nCruise line in the world right now it's called NFC cruises and the large in Europe um they're building another\nTeen boats right now they're building several more luxury cruise liners they've really been kind of like a royal Caribbean but mostly sticking over in Europe and now they're trying to expand in North America and South America as well\nI'm In what they what they started doing as an experiment is creating this ship with Ina shit experience where they would have\nLike only certain elevators that would go up to the top floors and that's where you'd have your butler serve as the balcony ticker rooms I'm kind of the high end experience private areas private restaurants like just things for the special people but within a boat\nIn what they found was the demand for those was far greater than what they projected they were constantly booked out for what we need to expand into more into the luxury space so now they're building dedicated smaller boats\nThat are going to compete more with the region the crystal cruise lines I'm of the world\nThe two boats they're building are going to cost about a billion dollars each while and they will only feature five hundred cabins that Pete's\nYeah so it's a large upfront investment no cruise boats can stay in service for a link the amount of time but that's still a a a hefty price tag a billion a piece for a smaller boat and a luxury boat um [noise]\nSo it's just interesting to see this shift in you know cruises used to be like\nYou know carnival in a region where you packed has made people onto a boat as possible and you go to a few destinations and now it's all about making the experience special or unique trying to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "18"}
