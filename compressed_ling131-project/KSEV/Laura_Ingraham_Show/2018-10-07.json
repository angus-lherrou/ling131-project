your ... and today we're providing a more effective road map to your financial freedom by\nUnderstanding the truth about four one K. is an IRAs and what you can do to get back on track\nWe've been dissecting the logic behind for one case in IRAs and the tips provided in a Motley Fool article by Selina Meyer and Sean\nShe lays out a plan based on twenty thousand dollars a year in income from Social Security which is actually Eighteen percent higher than the average Social Security came in at Seventeen thousand dollars a year\nAnd an additional thirty thousand dollars a year that she says you're going to get by drawing down your four one K. R. IRA at a rate of four percent a year\nAnd before we get back into the details if you'd like to ask a question on the air you can give me a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven happy to talk to you about this topic as IRAs and for one case or if you've got a quick question on real estate investing and single family or multifamily\nBy and hold investments happy to answer those too\nAnd if you'd rather email me your question you can do that it ask Lynn L. Y. N. N. F. L. U. I. N. C. dot com and I answer all of those questions personally [noise]\nOkay so let's get back to the article alright so if you only live twenty five years after retirement which would be about Ninety years old if you retire at sixty five she calculates that you're going to need to save seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\n[noise] so let's take that back up and take a look at what it takes to do that\nAnd I'm always interested in these articles as to the [noise] the basic assumptions that they make so she's already maintenance function that your earnings level has been\nEighteen percent higher than the average American pretty much throughout your your life span\nThan the average American pretty much throughout your your lifespan\nOr your your work history and so you're going to have twenty thousand dollars coming in from Social Security of course we could have a whole show just on whether Social Security is going to be there for you based on your age and that conversation has been going on for at least a generation so\nUh we'll set that aside and we'll go with the simple assumption that somehow the Social Security program is going to be there for you you are going to get an Eighteen percent more than the average\nAnd that's going to bring in twenty thousand dollars a year now you're looking for an additional thirty thousand dollars a year because she's determined that most people will live the retirement of their dreams on fifty thousand dollars which after taxes and an eleven percent federal tax rate\nWill be forty four thousand five hundred dollars are so that catches up to where we were coming out of the break so now she tells us that if you start with zero\nAnd you talk away ten thousand dollars a year and expected to grow by ... percent annually\nI so you go back and look at the annual growth rate in typical stock investments that you're going to make in a four O. one K. or an IRA which by the way those four one K. investments are very limited and choice so you can take a look at that see what what do you think that's going to actually hold over your lifetime\nBut at eight percent annually on average over twenty five years so if you're working twenty five years more and starting from zero right now you'll end up with almost eight hundred thousand dollars All right so ... is our seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar hurdle\nRight and uh she she gets a list of different um different time frame depending on how old you are where starting from and how many years you have left\nAnd a couch calculated based on five thousand ten thousand and Fifteen thousand dollar annually that will tell you that most people are living hand to mouth\nAnd those people do not save five thousand dollars annually they do not contribute to their four one case but let's just say you're contributing ten thousand [noise]\nSo our next step is to consult the financial advisor and of course she does know that they are going to charge you and\nThey may end up saving and earning you much more than you pay them so again yeah referring back to the financial advisor now most financial advisors if you go in and ask them what their own net worth is you're going to be very surprised\nMany financial advisors or right out of school many of them are also living hand to mouth many of them are not able to actually invest in the vehicles that they recommend for their clients\nAre there are some but I'm saying many financial advisors don't have the accumulated wealth that you do\nAnd yet we expect you to go to them for advice on what to do with your wealth when your retirement is at stake\nIt's time for another short break and when we return we're going to continue our conversation about four one K. and I are raised in a better way to secure your

Thirteen at the age or human looking the Carl's world people places an event I'm Robin\n... program was recorded earlier for rebroadcast at this time\n[noise]\nWhy\nAre\nMessage they read it never used on every radios on every fish\n[noise]\n\nYou'd ever knew to welcome to our number two for sex radio Miami ... here on the voice of Texas A M seven hundred KFC which taking your\nCalls have you want to join us here in our number two to eight one five five eight case the the\nTwo one five five eight five seven three eight in the first hour we went through this pretty extensively talking about the difference in response from Republicans and the Democrats today on the release of his death by FBI file on cap and all the latest been inquiry investigation\nYou understand he's now been investigated by the FBI seven times\nSeven times they've investigated this man found nothing yet it's not good enough for Democrats yeah these are the same people\nWell I just I don't go on a danger I'll stop right there these are the same people that well there's there's just not enough\nDuring a press conference this morning Chuck Schumer said the fears that the FBI would be limited from getting all the facts and their investigation have been realized and we said we knew this was going to happen with that they're just going to the way when it comes to week it's not enough time with you more time\nThat's all they're doing their delaying delaying into like the good thing is Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley said\nIt's time to vote and vote for cloture tomorrow for those of you may be watching on the Facebook page case to be a him seven hundred the most from Texas I put a poll on the video if you go to like the page case to be a um seven hundred divorced taxes like that page when you watch the video you can roll your miles from the video boom the poll pops up\nWill just be confirmed tomorrow we'll see\nWe don't know who's going to vote when we're ... we will see it looks like I think all the Democrats are against\nIt in other words this meant nothing to them they don't care they're just simply trying to play one before we get to the soldiers I Want to make sure that are we talking about the U.S weekly job claims dropped when you're forty nine year low\nAnd one of the Democrats are so mad more mega dacey their grip on power slipping by the minute the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits sheltering forty nine year low this week\nYet some held as a needle does the Trump was elected that's the time he was going to crash the exact opposite happened and now they're trying to figure out how to give credit to Morocco bomber\nThe data pointed to sustain labor market strength which should continue to under pan economic growth initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped eight thousand to a seasonally adjusted two hundred and seven thousand for the week of September twenty ninth according to the Labor Department\nJust may have something to do with why the daily tracking poll according to Rasmussen shows President Trump at fifty percent\nAll according to Rasmussen shows President Trump at fifty percent approval right now\nDuring chairman Grassley press comments earlier he talked about the protesters that came to his office I'm against cabin on some for Kevin Hall\nHe talked about the media he was addressing them said I'm never going to call you got fake news I told him fake news all the time but they're biased and he's absolutely right he said the protesters that were for Kavanaugh\nOut to talk to the media none in the media wanted to interview them they don't want to talk to him the only one to talk to those protesting against Kavanaugh is that not bias\nIt is biased as it's ever been the media\nIs the left arm of the Democratic party there was a left wing that's all they are they are propaganda\nAnd they try to Blake it in his quote objective little bubble in there and they're not they're not even remotely objective there are a bunch of Democrats and that's why they do what they do and they're trying to as well and I hate Trump because he calls him out for what they are oh man to to have him\nLet's go to the phones to a one size five eight five seven three eight let's figure out what the phantom who's been patiently holding have phantom welcome to the voice of Texas\nWhat's up ... are you doing I'm good how are you saying some pretty darned good not to give you a civic lesson what oh All right let me give you give me a lesson when\nYou know you and me a long time you know I'm borderline genius so uh\nAnd I asked you know when we started in the past year nearly ... ... I mean without the ... part so yeah\nI'll take that as a compliment\nUsing those big words you know so anyway ah\nAh when I was going to say is going to ask you a question who's constitutional duty is it your pick Supreme Court justices quit\nWho's constitutional duty to vote or to to pick pick the nominee\nYour point for the president\nIs that is right then explain to me why Merrick Garland is not on the Supreme Court you don't have to answer or you know the answer reason why I bring it up is because they invented a rule\nA few key Merrick Garland off the off the court and it was a Joe Biden so called real it was never enforced basically after the contentious hearing Clarence Thomas Joe Biden came out and said look in an election\nYear if you're going to appoint anybody or or as you suggest anybody they have to be you can't do it in an election year or if you do do it it has to be somebody that is\nMore leaning toward the the other party yeah and Merrick Garland is a moderate at that you know he was definitely middle of\nThe road but I'm Mitch McConnell refused to even bring him to the floor so now I'm going to ask you who is more ruthless Republicans and Democrats\nAre clearly right now is the Democrats\nNo it's the Republicans here's why they knew there was a chance that a Hillary Clinton might lose an election\nThey knew it was very slim and they knew that it was highly unlikely that she was going to leave but there was that chance is lacking dumb and dumber so you're saying that the chance\nAnd what happened was the Democrats were full of themselves so sure that a Hillary was going to win that they did not fight hard enough for ... they didn't fight hard enough where they knew it was going to get to pick 'em anyway\nThey're short starting this which is typical of the laugh I got to have it now and not have it now there's an old saying you can get rich slow but getting rich quick is very difficult to kind of like the foreigners in the air and here's how short sighted they are had they not bored Mork\nAnd Robert More men put on the Supreme Court\nRock Obama would have replaced him that's how short sided and dumb they are so my point being is fear not you're in pretty good hands if you're on the side of the right because they are Haitian they are ruthless and they know what they're doing sometimes they screw\nBut they're nothing like the left there not short sided they know that it is all cyclical and they won't\nHave their shot if you look at the end of the Democratic party how they're being left in the dark and every it makes you think well maybe this is not as bad as it sounds\n... um ... you know what kind of an anthem will be on the Supreme Court okay just like any other downed\nOh absolutely they already got the votes okay and you know what I'm Wondering if there is no way they voted out of closure had they not had the votes they gotta\nAnd yellow and calls where I got to get to them they really call a good little civics lesson I'll say this you know I didn't think the Republicans weren't ruthless I Would just say the Democrats were far more ruthless and also stand by that but what they do you talk about the Biden Rule\nI Would just say the Democrats were far more records and also stand by that but what they do you talk about the by moral absolutely they enforce that in the last the lame duck rule basically if you're a lame duck president that's it they're not going to allow a vote or did you go on and on about this but you made a really good point the role that not that you're wrong on anything you said\nYou go back and look at the wake of devastation what how many Democrats have lost in Harris County is different a lot of Democrats won throughout the rest of the country they have been for lack of a better term slaughtered in elections left and right\nOver and over and over again over the last few years Obama's one of the best thing that's happened the Republicans as far as well voting wise he tried to destroy the country in the process it's not as bad as you think but he made some really good points I mean I could do a whole show on that are actually call let's go to Pamela in oak forest thanks for hanging on Pamela welcome to the voice of Texas\nOh hi how are you I'm good how are you bail I'm just fine um what one person costs it'll if I call brilliant at some point anyway I call to make the point I think he\nKind of laid it that if the Democrats that we see and hear if I'm On that let you know the ... and now it's limited time around liquor and all kinds of people every day and I don't see any that craziness they actually had you know these are intelligent discussion and listen to each other\nBut one thing I'm tying to commit hate or in my family and a lot of older people that I deal with my parents were article id across the street\nThey just can't believe advice and eating it isn't and I tell them after it they're not going to change they don't care how you can't shame or they don't care\nSo don't worry about it but you have to look at it this fight every day did consenting Donald Trump and all the things that they tried to do at that got the power to the mainstream media and he's still won by Hollywood despite everything he's the only one who had been hacked or\nAt least one hand the power and very loud fans and don't don't even think\nThat the case who cares\nYeah and they say if you went to was funny as you got the right attitude because you're absolutely right if you just go in thinking listen they're not going to change doesn't matter what we do [noise] so what you do I get you get yourself active in and get involved they give us a call paying leverage you to get active it involved and you're jumping you're absolutely right you take your destiny and your own hands don't fit back\nSo you're absolutely right and and I you know would you agree with that point you made about\nSuddenly go ruthless cause more you're absolutely right these Republicans to Mitch McConnell there very long term thinking there look in the way ahead in the future what's going on and it's you don't want to pay back time if you will or at least try to get one more call in before we have to take the next break let's go to Cody listening into ... thanks for hanging out with a voice from taxes\nAre going to the number of duty how're you\nDoing good it it it it was only one that China and on a different idea but um basically you know you can kind of see what the landscape politics right now I'm really like I started to wonder why the in our two party system was created to begin with because really it's set up to be a divisive active\nOr devices looking toward ... let me really really hold on hold on a goatee liquor entire country and to go on\nTo the ... it wasn't designed to be a two party system there's been multiple argue that the wigs we've had all different kinds of party it evolved\nTo this point so I Want to make sure that we put it wasn't designed just redo parties you just sort of of all this way but anyway continue your point because in many ways I think you're correct to the country is sort of being split between what you said the Democrats and Republicans are sort of split in the country down the mental\nYes sir yeah and I I feel like if we were to eradicate the party it's just the one on beliefs and what you know what the what the person actually wants to change and do um it would eradicate all those have all this you know a division all this you know United States\nYou know it's like the divided states of America no you know what I mean so well and you know you're going to look very\nFar for the country and said kind of sad to see where where things are today you know losing the nine eleven and ordered\nWell thank you for your service Cody appreciated I appreciate your call as well here's what are the only thing I'll disagree with you on\nNot necessarily the party these are people does it matter what they signifies Republicans\nOr Democrats will give these Republicans that are wine those the Susan Collins Jeff Flake a whole goes on and on that being said you're white people will take any opportunity to divide themselves it's a human instincts that's what they do\nThe country's states I mean it just the way it goes\nHe says the party's bitter dividing people or is it their beliefs the reality is it's the people since our beliefs you go up north east they're very liberal you come down south we tend to be more conservative even little liberals down there are more conservative than some of the conservatives Morsi's\nBob ... I'm Sorry Chris window on the filibuster George W's domination of the straw to the ... circuit court the wall Street Journal uncovered their strategy memos and it's set up a straw was especially dangerous they called him because he was a Latino\nAnd he said they see the the memo said they seem to be grooming him for us\nIt's a Latino and he said they said the the memo said they seem to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointments and they couldn't afford to let the first Latino a Supreme Court justice to be a Republican nominee so they filibustered it in other words they they they tanking because of the race\nNever happened before it was unprecedented like yo straw to add a majority of Senate support but\nThey did it nine more times than Schumer even bragged about it\nUm so what Obama gets elected Harry Reid changed the rules of the Senate which was the infamous a nuclear option so that a judge is only needed fifty one votes sixty right\nAnd they filled the courts with Obama's judges and flip many of the circuits from conservative or liberal so when the Republicans retook the Senate if you fast forward\nThey refused to a schedule a vote on Obama's nominee Merrick Garland\nAnd they ah ... ah McConnell's sided Schumer's rule you've said hey ah you know we're not supposed to ah no no president should be allowed to nominate a Supreme Court justice during his final year in office and look how said yeah that sounds good to us and so they didn't bring him up for a vote infuriated the Democrats\nAnd so in an act of revenge they threatened to filibuster Neil Gorsuch\nYeah and that's when McConnell did his own nuclear option\nAnd change the rules for fifty one votes for Supreme Court justices and so if the Democrats hadn't attacked look yellow straw to they still have the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees but they don't and so this desperation and we've been watching play out during the cabin I arranged\nIs their own fall\nAnd you know I say tough I think the guy's going to get away you're going to get a voted in they can't stopping\nAnd what we've seen I think it's pretty dangerous for the republic or it's you know the the scorched earth policy this despicable character assassination how\nAre you going to get these people to step forward to serve in government if this is what they're going to do to you\nKnow a niche they give us a call Bob good points I you know you guys are doing better show than I Am I only have to show your points\nAnd the reality is ... and you point out something very stoop to knew the Democrat they're the ones that did they're the ones doing the underhanded tactics there they run around talking about how there for\nYou know an equal opportunity but they're the biggest racist we know and they're the ones we're talking about well you know a women's rights and look at Hollywood all of these predators are all your old Democrat who did Bill Clinton so\nThe war on women everything they accuse the other side of doing they're the ones that are the most guilty of it so\nThe reality is is you gotta pointed out what's good for the goose\nIs good for the gander\nIt's amazing how are you guys hang on the phones I Want to get into this could go to the next break this document story that will come back and take your calls and wrap up today show um personal information of these three Republicans have been posted on the Internet according to Capitol police last week\nDemocrats staffer on Capitol Hill been charged with identifying information about Republican senators and putting out\nA this guy is Jackson a Costco twenty seven years old and he's an intern for Sheila Jackson Lee\nOkay this guy's been arrested\nFox reporting the personal information of senators Lindsey Graham Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch had been posted on Wikipedia or in the Senate Judiciary committee pages while they were questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week\nOkay this guy has been arrested Sheila Jackson Lee angrily denied anyone in the office had anything to do with it she said lives lives in order to make them allies\nI honestly disgusted to spread in ... of the completely false and observed and dangerous live and conspiracy theories that are being pedaled by the ultra right wing pundits I'm looking fast right wing conspiracy outlets in the west side tour promoting a fraudulent claim that a member of my staff was responsible for the least\nOf personal information of members of the U.S Senate on ... and this was unfounded allegation and it's completely false and an absolute lie\nGlenn rushing congresswoman chief of staff was a little more contrite yesterday he said it's unfortunate instead they're cooperating with law enforcement\nLegion Jill and these are the when I say the Democrats are more ruthless\nAnd more nefarious the Democrats are the ones that are ... people Democrats are the ones that are showing up at restaurants and shouting at people the Democrats are the ones marching on Capitol Hill screening there's going to be war in the streets if you don't vote against Kavanaugh\nAnd the Democrats are the ones who are going to be United against Kavanaugh ... at once again I'm\nNot seeing the Republicans aren't you know can be equally as ruthless but it's pretty clear in this time day and age with Cory Booker center right and he meant it\nThese people don't care they're going to vote for him this was they stole tactic older doing was trying to stall long enough to come up with some kind of dirt so that they can absolutely denied this guy from getting appointed so then they can hopefully hang on to that power\nGet through the midterms pick up the seat or two and prevent Donald Trump from nominating anymore because they I think at this point everybody understands everybody's time is limited but especially when you're talking about Ruth Bader Ginsburg even Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out and chastised the Democrats for how nasty they were being\nToo uh Kavanaugh even she gets into smear job\nLet's take a short break and come back and get all your calls Brooklyn building Rob and John you guys hang on a you're listening to the voice of

think of to help you with your retirement planning we have articles are all kinds of stuff so money matters dot net at our website\nSo we're going to talk now about\nWhat ... what we believe when when you retire\nYou know you kind of become a defensive coordinator if we wanted to put it in football terms okay so when you are working and you're accumulating your on off ants right so you're building you're putting money in your you have wages and all those kind of thing so you're living on that and you're putting your money away and so therefore and you have time on your side\nAnd so because of all of that you can be more aggressive in my opinion you can you can take a little bit or you know a a of an aggressive stance but once you are within five years of retirement or five years after that ten year period\nThat is and and we looked at it we believe it's one of the ... one of the most important periods of your entire financial life\nAnd if you do the math on it and you take a big loss or you do badly during that time you spend too much money or you do any of those kinds of things during that time what could happen is you could actually run out of money and that would not be good so as we work with clients are we we take into account or Eighteen risks faced in your retirement\nAnd uh I Know Eighteen [laughter]\nYou thought there were only three right but there are Eighteen and we're going to talk about number seven this week which is elder\nAbuse and this is something that if you have a parent who's in their seventies or or or older or they are the number one according to a\nA these studies that are ... are are the targets for this kind of thing and so let me give you some stats on this is actually quite a a disturbing so the annual loss due to elder financial abuse\nTo point six billion dollars or many of the victims are never the same emotionally after being taken advantage of by someone they trust now here's the thing the typical victim is a woman Seventy to eighty nine years old however\nThe victims represent ... there is a diverse profile including older men and ah it also exits across all ethnic and socio economic groups so it's not limited just to uh women but it is primarily a women\nAre the biggest perpetrators fifty five percent of the perpetrators our families friends\nNeighbors and caregivers\nBut it was you gotta do humidity started back and a hand gun\nWell actually do that's a little extreme is fixed there might be a better way we'll talk about a better way of doing it then that a sixty percent of family perpetrators are adult\nChildren adult children\nYou know years ago we actually had that happened we had a client whose son was using his power of attorney to\nSteal money from from that um the crimes often involve misuses of power of attorney stealing money using the credit cards you know they they do that borrowing against the elder person's home et cetera\nThe financial abused perpetrated by businesses can involve large sums of money and I and and these these companies are if you want to call him that these these illegal people they it's like your business and they they can have hundreds of victims okay so what do you do about it well\nNow first of all I'm going to get a a little quick checklist here so you can protect yourself from that by staying organized\nYou know first of all no where everything you've got is and what it's doing so when you get a call that says you know your your investment or whatever is a ... something's happening there you know that it's not true I'm\nOpen and than your own male\nOkay don't have somebody else reads your e mails for you open your mail for you or anything like that because they'll get communications that will have your account numbers and all those kinds of things on it and then they can take advantage of that\nUh the same thing with signing of checks and and credit cards and all that kind of thing do it yourself don't have somebody else do that for you\nSet up a direct deposits for all checks that you get you know for example Social Security other things make sure that any regular checks that you get or direct deposit it to your back because if they are sent to your house somebody gets it and guess what okay\nUse use your voice mail if you get a call from somebody from a a a a number that you don't recognize don't answer that let it go into voicemail listen to the voicemail and then decide if you want to go after that\nAnd then finally make sure that uh you're wills your advanced directives powers of attorney or executed to ensure that only trusted individuals' can step in to make decisions for you okay and and if you are a child of an older person than those same things would apply for you okay but just something for you to think about

course I Am your house Kendall race\n[noise]\nJak and you know if a lousy ... go back to their spouses when the stock market goes down then I bet there were a lot of family reunions on in two thousand and eight and nine which you say [noise]\nAnyway we are back I Am can rewrite the host of money matters with Ken my rape I've been in the ... I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all the idea that we talk about on this show these our ideas that are designed around retirement planning because we are a retirement planning specialist and that we currently work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families\nAre in forty three states and we are blessed an honored\nAnd uh for the second year in a row or money matters are from is a finalist in the two thousand uh Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics yes calmer\nA and we'll we'll know if we're going to be a winner last year we were a finalist and this year we are on November first\nThe awards ceremony will tell us if we will win the the grand prize but\nJust to be nominated just to be one of the uh um you know the people that are in in the running for ethics by the better Business Bureau we perceived to be a very nice thanks so we're very proud of that now one of the foundational philosophy that we have because we are a retirement planning specialist and and and primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty\nUm is that we believe that when you\nAre retired or five years before retired you should be very defensively minded okay now you want to grow your money okay we want you to go out and enjoy your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to do that okay so they'll play whatever that means you have great fun enjoy travel family\nGolf tennis maybe I Love tennis\nYou know go do whatever it is that you love doing that just always remember that when it comes to your finances\nIf that's going to support your lifestyle\nYou have to make sure that it's there to do it [laughter]\nOkay does that sound logical to you so therefore we believe that you should protect your principal\nYou've spent twenty Thirty years building it and now you don't want a market crisis or a a bear market like Y. two K. or two thousand eight to come in and raw view of half your money or something like that guy so we believe that you need to protect what you built\nAnd my whole which is kind of the mainstream if if you if you ... if you look at it that way idea of investing is that you buy a quality package of investments\nAnd then you rebalance them you know periodically and your job is done because you're a long term investor and everything's gonna work out\nWell we don't agree with that I mean we agree with that you should buy equality set of investments you should diversify you should make sure that you're taking only as much risk because it's necessary so we believe all of that and you should rebalance we believe that as well but we believe that it's all incomplete\nBecause no matter how you know if you look at two thousand and eight for example a diversification only work if you had treasuries pretty much you know everything else lost money so\nYou know and not every single thing but if you look at it in general or the stock market went down and many bonds went down and says like where where could you hide in two thousand eight\nSo we believe you need to have an overlay you need to have a strategy to sell to actually get out and you know traders on a on the wall street and I say T. R. A. D. E. R. not trade towards the traders um ... most traders have\nWhat they call ... strategy okay they invest but they already know when they're going to sell when they invest that's just smart you know you gotta know skinny a a a Rogers used to say you got to know when to hold him and when the older you don't just keep playing\nRogers used to say you got to know when to hold them and when the older you don't just keep playing ... losing hand is not a good idea so therefore we believe you buy hold and you also selling in November of two thousand seven\nWe told ... none of you who are listening to show we and uh and and anybody that gets our weekly market alert email 'em and our clients he said it was time to get out of the stock market or strategy hit signal does that and we actually said to stay out for eight almost Eighteen months almost a year and a half\nUm until June of two thousand nine so those of you that followed the that that uh advice you were out of the market at the stock market to a and hopefully that helped to avoid large losses now\nThe by hold argument against that that I've heard is that if you sell you know what we're going to put it you're going to put it in cash and the answer that I say is yes and I mean money markets and that kind of thing uh but if you do that you're not going to make any money and so you know that\nThat one really gets makes me actually frustrated because in a in a period of crisis\nYour focus is on protecting its not building I mean think about there's a there's a hurricane coming okay it's a massive hurricane that's coming\nAnd you're saying okay batten down the hatches well no don't do that because now you can't keep building\nWhat does that mean you don't know what are you going to be building for when it's a hurricane coming that's not the time to be thinking about building it's a time to think about that now the actors and protect yourself protect their don't let it get crushed in the hurricane\nSo in your investment world thinking about growing in a time when there's a market crisis to me it's like you got your eye on the wrong ball what are you thinking about you got to protect what you have\nSo this notion that you're going cash you don't make any money first of all I disagree with that just philosophically but secondly you know Benjamin Franklin once said that a penny saved the penny earned\nAnd if you sell and and your investments that you didn't that had you stayed in go down to me whatever they go down by that journey okay\nSo in two thousand eight to ... the S. and P. five hundred index went down what forty percent plus so if you were out of the stock market if you're out of the S. and P. when that happened in my view what that means is the penny saved that forty percent plants that you didn't lose that's the forty percent that you made and to me that's pretty darn good\nNow the other part of this that I just wanted to say is that a yes it's true that right now interest rates are low but this is a novelist you know these interest rates we've seen the last ten years that that's not normal I mean if you go back in history there's very few times when we've had zero percent interest rates\nSo while it's true now I don't know that it's it it would be true in the future also so that whole argument about if you sell and going cash you won't make any money just does not hold water with me All right now if you believe\nIf you are over fifty if you are retired are retiring soon and you believe that uh you want to go enjoy your your second childhood you want to go play and have fun but to do that you believe that you also have to protect what you Bill\nThen we may be the financial advisory firm for you and so you can go to our website is money
