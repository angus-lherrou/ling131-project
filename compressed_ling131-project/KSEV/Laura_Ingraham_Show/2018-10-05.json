entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed a it's a terrific Columbine Cavanaugh I think it's it it was both well timed and important to do this\nOr let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina a wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five ... welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to just be the right now [noise] so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republican outta fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think a chore seeing the results of that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think we're getting a little too even besieged and the questions\nAnd Kevin I was\nI think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhere the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but it said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that you need to look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming that's political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mangled we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nThis is Renee

done well I Know your value in okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator other president\nYour reaction to that\nWho have their reaction to that my I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by as what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura odd to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed and as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be ... um and I have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be on basically a relevant and when I talked about the fabric bag which by the way it is trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations that\nI have a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that he's talking about the process\nThey if you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how\nRight well we have a right or it was a comedy I write of course I was\nTalking to I was talking to NBC reporters two of them are shouting at me\nAnd I looked at the one the male reporter uh Pete Alexander and I said do you ask her operation you know where she did her how she got there do you now she got home do you have you found anybody and he's you know swallowing hard and then asking that question and Christ and Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like a ... in the process\nShe you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and that decency and you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nAnd then you're like you know if you have to explain you were there and you wonder if that was our at by the\nWay and I wasn't yesterday I wasn't yesterday but I'm not going to be bullied a particularly by particularly by that person\nNo but the funny thing is killing and I'm just I I just to the stuff up for people because otherwise I just repeat\nIt because then all of it was just a very funny\nDay I Know but it's funny you know every other day you're going to the funny thing is that you got to do it again yeah that I Know many people

Anthony like what are you seeing\nAll week I can just absolutely agree with what everyone else that we've talked over four hundred thousand dollars in Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage of thing innocent before proven\nThat you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until proven guilty or not the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and its change their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the the ... again I think the American people at their core our fear beyond ideology beyond anything a layer fair minded people and had these allegations panned out\nA witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of it but the unrelenting salt on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you lord said that the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the year of the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you that\nThe polls are tightening of between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I helped settle and it gets all of that turn out instead of to look in terms of that cat on his part of it now you got to get out there and the turnout while matter I think family can land so we all have to pull together\nAll right we believe that their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break and we'll get to all your cold eight five five forty Laura ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news show said\n\n\nOh wait three hundred twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack happened I got four hundred it makes the natural hungry I started noticing more energy I noticed what do you were starting to shrink\nShe weighed come off some around three thirty to forty five four fifty six year old guy could lose that much worse it's an older brother I feel I feel like I was when I was thirty five years old\nThat was Reuben now look into what Josh says about ... four hundred\nRandom stuff really works there was an ... for the commercials offered got other you know I'm just going to try it my parents were like falling off it really works about foods last year for my new job if they are falling off at the same\nGuys if you lose that leads to gain energy strength and muscle and look and feel years younger try and answer all\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I also the mother of friends\nAnd I would the I'm very concerned about uh my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the right to express themselves we certainly know\nIn certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards um towards a Christine Christine but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and in Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well and when people choose to actually say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then\nEvery five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family [noise] so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed before and they've proven guilty so that's\nA ... I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there that they feel ... they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread come and on the same way the president's ... up until we can go to knew he was\nBut watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down\nTo what you just mentioned it seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this is this ideological blood sport and\nA man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence and shame destroyed his reputation for all the time in public\nAnd even force of all of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think is is the Americans look at that and go man this concerns me\nJunior I Want to ask you um you you have any big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand number two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing is going to really play into that because it's making women I\nReally upset that people are playing that the women against manned card and and safety Abrams is a woman but by and count is a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I think just in the last week or so across the state people are more motivated than ever now to get out\nGet out and vote and not only that but volunteer that I was at the camp campaigning either gay people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and\nHow we see this politics they implied out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nNo no I I you know as I look out and watches it\nIt does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs in confrontations with senators\nAnd these dramatic moments at the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids\nIf you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think he's were propelled Trump into office and it was like kind of well he called it the silent majority\nI'm my sense of each is working Americans\nAnd Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the work and they're working they privately have their views about politics if they've spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply you don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets\nBut moms wives working women I I I don't think that's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia of your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\nOdd things that are due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are in our job to get out and vote\nFor Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because of West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nSo that ... twenty sixteen so that means that we had had Democrat votes as well and I believe that the Democrats also are a work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time\nSo I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's all last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country so\nToo I don't want you to do that for a military we now we need you in December so maybe my last breath I'm so busy [laughter] well you keep going great to talk to junior high our last word do you\nUm you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia\nOr given the enthusiasm we're seeing given the Kavanaugh fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will have a ...\nI ... I think it ... more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about mid term because a lot of times people don't get excited about them in terms I think we're going to see it where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way it's going to comment and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom and weight loss\nSick and tired of the in the late around and they are going to stand up for their freedom for a lot our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not going to be a way it's going to be a thing on it and people are going to a shot shock and it's like ...\n... a Jody Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans are really bad at telling their story I always take them for this they they can't tell a story to save their life in\nThis instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in and say project themselves on to a cabin on his family and what they've been through\n[noise] well I agree with what the other gal Thad in Indiana we love our country and we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence says if a law in Indiana\nAnd we are here to say that we support I Supreme Court justice it supports the constitution or the United states a living breathing document\nAnd for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat will actually be the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that measures bully then\nSo we believe that we're so we're going to see a red wave a red suit in our state of voters that come out that never happened before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nAnd we're looking for um the numbers to begin changing and Donnelly will pay quite a price for his stand and saying that it could change its mind remember that he was voted the most ineffective senator and the fact that he could still change his mind and turn around but at the votes against the\nSupreme Court nomination I think that he will see that that he gave us a gift in the state of Indiana because people are going to rally to the cause\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the fall in the winter and in the spring all seasons you can save money without of conciliation believe it or not radium barrier and solar addict fans\nWe're also gonna be talking about how you can get a deal on your front door refinishing today the holidays are coming up not too far down the road so we're going to be getting out a deal from our friends over it's dirty doors you can stay tuned for that and also we

welcome\nTo the show how are you oh I'm doing great thanks for having me appreciate it\nIt's great to have you here my friend um [noise]\nI don't know if this is good or bad we're going into\nCooler months cooler weather I think it's good but in the antique business it's you know pretty much your busiest time in the summertime in some ways people kind of panic they don't do what we said\nFor them to do in the off season and the off season the cooler months we say get it done now because it'll be easier on Tom Cruise 'cause it's not as hot you'll be able to get scheduled and no one even build saved more money in the cooler months on the actual install itself and then when it's hot and you don't have to worry about it\nExactly know what it is cool and out so\nActually we probably have a little less panicky customers so it's actually better because then we come out to do an evaluation on the addict and there's a lot of some of those little things that need to be done or\nYou'll just kind of things that need to be taken care of an address and yet if we can do that when it's cooler we can spend more time in the ...\nIn the summer I hate to say that you get in a hurry but you can only spent so many hours in that kind of keeps but she wants it gets passed about one or two o'clock in the afternoon it's just too hot so we can do actually less jobs in the summer than we can in the winter so probably things better this time of year so we can get a better deal or we can do a better job and\nYou can save money you're around so this was a home improvement project so it's not

Ballard Ninety eight square foot it's an eight inch added fifty percent off it's only Ninety five percent Ninety five cents to wait one nine three six zero five five nine time before we get back into the addict discussion holidays are coming up and when your friends and family come over and they come to your front door\nThey're coming up and when your friends and family come over and they come to

probably look even even that is going to change over the years because of everything they put on top of your thing and so forth things can yellow and change on friday in any case only two hundred and forty nine dollars it not three hundred save\nA over fifty dollars today to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine only five people will get this deal today\nCall now to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine one more time to wait one three nine seven three seven eight nine we talked about adding insulation and the first segments on\nIt is important I Would I Would say that if you have to have that at work done and you're deficient in insulation I Would probably have that done first unless you have absolutely no ventilation but chances are you have some [noise]\nUm and then I'd probably do radiant barrier last depending upon if I had trees or other buildings that were shadow in my house\nYeah I thought yeah every house a little different um insulation definitely up almost every house that we do we had insulation I'm a lot more data will will go on wet insulation we'll put a couple of for fans in and maybe you had a radio barrel all at once um it just depends on the house we just did a house yesterday\nAnd it was a removal and we did new a new insulation got all the old insulation solar fainted but they already had a right to radio or so in that case they didn't really need and they really didn't even need the rating of ... that they had it wasn't really giving them the value because it was there's a lot of trees over the roof\nOf soda and a case like that if they hadn't had writing I wouldn't have recommended it because it was over in king would end was covered in trees\nSo insulation made way more sense they are going to get a lot of bang for money quick return on investment always tell people I like to kind of giving realistic expectations so I'm not going to say well you put a solar fan and it's going to pay for itself and three months\nThat's probably not the case it might be a year or depending on the on the addict temperatures and what's going on and maybe a three year pay back and then I let them make the decision which way they want to go cause some people say well you know through your pay but it's pretty good at thirty three percent on my money that's not bad\nPlus you get the tax credit missing certain things so we kind of go over all that will come out and we do the attic analysis and that's really the best place to start when you're doing looking at doing an addict is take a look at it but an expert look at it and see what you actually need\n'cause a lot of times you don't just need everything just like taking your car into to the shop and doesn't necessarily need breaks in the battery and a new windshield and new tires and it doesn't need to everything may be maybe doesn't decide it's ours\nBut it you know have somebody behind a card if you haven't heard of their trial lawyer and everything maybe you know as a result maybe you might want to go somewhere else get a second opinion so we don't do that will look at the addict and see what it actually needs but um and then the radiant barrier you know if it's exposed to the sun\nAnd you've got dark shingles I'll hear it you definitely need to do like you're a young black roof yeah yeah of course you need rating better\nYeah you know if you if you can if you want to do that but you don't have any inflation and then I Would still anymore let's start with the inflation is going to do one not as if it's not a real big house like Melissa's do but we do at the same time because most of our project we can do within a day or\nDoesn't take too long usually a couple of hours per function though for doing insulation figure a couple of hours radio a couple of hours so usually most people they want to take a day off of work to actually do the work we can do it all in one day and we also do Saturday appointments and do installed on Saturday says well\nFifty percent off certain he'd blown in insulation today here on the chicken for radio show from my friend Tom decker addict innovations he'll put an eight inch ad and on top of what you have it makes a huge difference he did it in my home I Love it I've got three different addict as well\nUh ordinarily a dollar Ninety eight square foot only Ninety five cents six hollers\nCan get it however three already gotten it\nYes and yes the ... and so basically when they call will come out with the attic analysis and that they like if they needed slaves and then will honor that price for that so I've had a few people call me or I'll get out there and I said oh I I was one of the first to cause a thought I was getting a whole house full of free insulation it's like\nNo it's a free analysis sort of sort of make sure everybody because we're in the last three or straightforward it's a free analysis will come out and look at it and see what you need and then we'll give you fifty percent off the whatever the insulation of that that's what you need it if you need it maybe don't need it maybe maybe it would be a better option so that's really the ... come on look at it and then we'll go there that's the best thing to do\nOkay to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly free more callers can get the deal\nAnd before we move into radium barrier and solar addict fans I Want to just finish this deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine\nIf this is something you think that you want to have done within the next four six eight we call now or something you want to have done next year leave the phones open for people who really want this time can only get to deal with so many people\nYeah we get that to some some will get people to oh I get out there like oh we're going to do something we're thinking like maybe two years we're actually going out of the country for six months I Will call me at six months 'cause you know some of the good even changed over the six but maybe it's like what they decide well now we're going to sell the house and\nWell now we just want to bring it up to maybe in our thirties just to pass minimum building till we don't want to do the are thirty eight so kind of you know do it when you're ready if it\nTo me there's no time like the president so if you're thinking about doing insulation and he's thinking well maybe in two years we're going to sell the house well when you sell it they're going to do a home inspection and they're going to look at the inflation and if it doesn't meet building code that's got to come up on the inspection report is insufficient inflation and somebody's gonna want you to pay for it\nSo if you do it now and the two years it could pay for itself just an energy savings and you don't even worry about it we put gauges in there and you're you're good to go so\nReally it's not like the presence of do insulation\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine in Tom's number Tom can answer the phone right now sometimes she does but he's on the air right now it goes to trust the staff at the office they're fantastic um you know I have to complement you and your team\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone at the two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nThey're addict is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet exactly so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radical can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it 'cause most people have kind of an idea that I think it's about twelve hundred fear or whatever as in like OK and will measure it and say yeah sure enough that's right I'm just kind of the normal will just come out with you a quick measure make sure where everybody on the same page\nAnd the will get them the exact Christ would give them the quote right on the spot or so we don't say oh email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kind of stuff will give you the price right there on the spot so you know right where you stand\nAnd that way you can say you know while the radio was say say the radio was twelve hundred in the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be\nAnd then we can make a decision then we can talk over the options the pros and cons of of each so that's why I like to give prices right on the spot so people know where they had and they can make an educated decision versus just saying if I just emailed him over all the pricing later then but they ... they don't know which way to go because\nWe're not there and we can't really talk about it and yeah it's better to get it out and we'll sit down even if it takes an hour to to go over well we'll talk to you and we'll figure it out of most of our appointments really let it take about thirty to forty five minutes will come up in the attic\nTakes maybe ten minutes to go running we have for him and if you want to chit chat and you know give us cookies or something will will do that too but it doesn't take long to do this process we're not there to keep\nYou know banging on your end and making you want to buy something I had a company come out one time they were trying to tell me\nSome stuff from my house and they were there for four hours like this is ridiculous it's like what are you guys doing it's like they don't let them know our our our ... you know he didn't say yes that's why they're there for four yet he kept saying oh it's like you know I think people are saying well we're going to think about or I'm going to talk to my wife and she gets home I'm like\nGreat does fine let's let me know she has any questions give me a call it's I'll give you my cell phone number and we'll just you know I'm happy to I'm happy to leave for like your your call me back I would've confident we're going to get the business of the customers actually going to do an addict job we're going to get to work because our reputation as so solid\nFifty percent off the radiant barrier today heat block ultra\nIt's not two dollars today that's normal pride but here on the check a pro radio show for my listeners it's only a dollar per foot dollar per square foot fifty percent off to wait one nine three six zero five five nine how many of these are you giving away today\nAre one thing do for those written we do a little less on those as we have to be ... in the morning because he just gets too hot and the owners to do the radiant work out so we limit that a little bit more floor will do for us\nFour to eight one nine three six zero five five night for callers only I'm so radiant barrier it's something that um some of my listeners will needs to order from you and some won't and that is because\nUm for the past handful of years builders have put them in New bills\nYes all the new construction has radiant bear but the houses six or seven years old or you know we're older than that then there's a good chance that they don't have already had barrier\nAnd if you don't have any merit than er there's probably an eighty percent chance that we would recommend it now the reason we wouldn't recommend it is the house was completely covered in ... you know you don't have that radiant energy hitting the roots of why would you need it\nOr um if you are getting some sunlight but you we have unbelievable ventilation and the addict\nAnd we feel like whether he's coming in but it's being exhausted properly you maybe don't either ... or from that will say well you know you could use the rainy very but maybe the little more ventilation would be a little less caustic as expensive below more cost effective to go ahead and just put forth fan\nSo that's all we do the addict analysis um I'd recommend already but I have it in my house of course\nUm I Would never have a house without a ... but actually you're exposed to fear in hopes of getting off it was if it was like a magnolia and it was covered with trees I did have a house out there and it didn't have already buried and it was under three hundred percent trees I didn't need to remember I didn't put it in there was no point\nI'm just insulated really well so sometimes there's different things that we can do maybe we can\nIf you're leaning one way that maybe we over insulated a little bit if the spending on on the house and how it's structured or somehow says you can't put more inflation of because they've got it all decked him they store stuff up there addict\nAnd the stuff everywhere it's like okay well we really need to work on the addict temperature because we can't get enough insulation images ... stuff up there so that would definitely would record a reading a radio bear and then maybe since ... we want to keep the temperature down as low as possible so every house with a little different that's why we do the analysis\nHow many of these can you give away today or for for the call now too late one nine three six zero five five
