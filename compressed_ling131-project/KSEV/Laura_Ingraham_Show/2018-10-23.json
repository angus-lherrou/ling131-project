do one thing\nFlood the United states with mostly indigent low skilled workers who cannot speak English and who just want to live here and not follow our laws\nBecause if they did they'd be filling out immigration paperwork like everyone else around the country no respect for Guatemalans migration for Mexican migration law\nAnd now us migration that's three countries laws they violated by doing us busting passed police officials in some cases of salt in police official it is a scandal\nIn by the way other elements in this a migrant mob are present us border patrol officials have reported that\nThe majority of these people are not criminals there no terrorists and they're not even immigrants and refugees and upon nature in the United states we have to choose what kind of nation we are and treat than I was that one way and we had a pre Josh than we are going to say all of them are are cleaning up all of them I recognize that is not true so what do we have to do\nEach to listen to

president of states demonizing thousands of migrants coming towards us for that effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers and refugees and so on a who many of these people were especially qualify for that kind of status and you're going off on these migrants are describing them as much Thirteen or no Middle Eastern\nI I don't need to hear about Bangladesh she joined the migrant caravan and Guatemala according to Univision correspondents yesterday\nA Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said said that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass

Saturday no a day of the week it is but listen here's the bottom line and in the paper is that Senator McCaskill\nHas been in politics thirty six years that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington for twelve long years she's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration or shoot sponsoring that open borders bill with diet five died\nOr whether it's the judges she voted no on judge Kavanaugh was all for the terrible fear that her party carried out you voted no of course the ... Supreme Court justices\nThat are at McCaskill is and she just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people in this state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mom I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] that doesn't really capture it in my view I Want to have people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a it's going to be a crash\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna cause a huge problem for immigration officials and for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in the very really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days this yesterday every stop I made all over the the people asked me they said what is going on and they what they say thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness and it's got a threat to the country and now to have Claire McCaskill the face of this threat sponsoring\nIt open border bill I I just can't think of any work so I took a war we\nCan't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing and its highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nTo print is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's had forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was\nA how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report their Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my day when they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country and they're good for Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate is decades of the state of Missouri job growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth John broker type point since the Nineteen eighties\nIn the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nThere were scared folks up a Democrat Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy weaker overseas weakness on our border and that you know we can't have that in fact what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all the undercover videos of Claire McCaskill\nHarris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of line and the voter it's we can't really say what we really mean about a very efficient\nThough I think it's been a resident and you know the people to pay to\nTo have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up bond or back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away Second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nTo belong to people by virtue of our constitution that you're talking about I was to take those away from all five of citizens here staff talk about concealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with broad Obama\nOn everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are\nAre so close minded and then at the ... staff was caught saying over and over and over again it's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter it's really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the states who is not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to do represent\nA Josh a when you look at the makeup of the Democratic party today and the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seem to be encouraged even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities is is it happening it's not so much in\nA you know in in places like Missouri but it it it's covered a lot in certainly certainly and socks and other networks is that on people's mind the president says mom's not jobs ah and if people just wanting to calm down and government work for them\nYou know I think that if you had to leave her in Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it's chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos that is ...\nAnd I think that folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting and senator he's I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this was not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but to try and shut down speech\nAnd harassed intimidate and even use violence against people I mean I'd have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see these mom tactics employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a conservative religious voters have in the social\nTransformation of the country and the and the idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate dancing in public schools and\nAnd obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\n[noise] you know the Missourians who believe in the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment\nYou know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion to\nChurches to individuals you know this is something or for the most of my career and all the politics for two years you back on ... ... yeah\nYeah I spent most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nBut as a religious liberty lawyer and the people I said there are a fair minded people\nAh they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the important for the value of faith and we believe that the importance of value family community thinks built around faith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda\nWhich has become so hostile but the people of faith so hostile to religious liberty just like a talk show through our Second Amendment rights just like a become hospital of free speech what do you think about it what what are the left wing of the really offered to\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up and that is just not what the people by state law that will hold after it\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for him of met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right genes on\nCritical issues from crime to the economy and immigration stuff what but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win in because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles

they can do with you that oh well we had a surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office\nI started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it just

getting on the ground based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything think very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very very very few of them beard off that nets\nMessage are they very\nVery very few of them veered off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because\nYou know you will catch people in the line okay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward chat this say that and I said well he told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming if you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we\nDon't have any leaders I go up and talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward I said well you guys have matching backpacks you had\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked\nThat tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the group said they did have some bucking that people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or that they heard it and use a that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras uh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between\nThe various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here\nHas been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections\nAnd create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\nOne thing I I find to be very disturbing or the or are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are\nPeople with flatbed trucks\nOn these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to\nCoach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan why they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or something isn't done to stop and soon we'll be well they're not a Sarah a\nGroup of thousands every week coming into our into our borders ... absolutely\n... absolutely or this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part of these caravans of big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media\nAre in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to Guatemala and officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this\nThey talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a debate you was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government wouldn't have any access to the body or one of the reasons or the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people\nThat were coordinating this group with either manslaughter or murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nNot just regular farm workers are people for villages\nAre that are hardworking people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gay members there are some pretty bad guys in these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so\nWe're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use by\nThese organizers by these governments\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are\nReady to move forward because we're never once they get this thing started once the ball yeah rolling there's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of their cars going to let us into a their country and they coached them my coach them on credible fear credible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you say in America\nAnd it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then he released to the piece of paper and a judge has an old women and children separately you can't keep it keep them under the twenty days and then\nThey're off of the reasons it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of really democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional Saturday again they'll feel like a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that has\nTo retrieve a bowl for Republicans\nIn irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nA great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a ship it if they become citizens of course there was another shift or one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know if all of a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother so that they just release them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing\nOh we have men who have little girls they know they can't put them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they can't separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problem that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump\nIs it very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do for\nIn fact being overrun cue till I think the most important thing we can do\nThe United states or the Guatemalan government even went in Honduras right now for the high during the government is working against some of the social it's a a aspects of their ... their country at political uh apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this it any less money for us aid going to find these groups that\nAre coordinating the dapper didn't really start putting the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people may as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop it we're going to school that funding from from USAID a groups that are that are actually assist in this a carrot and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along the track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with a with children are being uh exposed to this type of I read us\nCare of that and that's why they put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable it they're not I'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose he's doing this and what's going on\nOut well again ... follow the money some understanding the fuel for the truck someone's paying for the\nUh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't

Texas and\nMy client goes why I think that was my wife and of course a convenience store laugh\nSo this is my first of many trips to Austin to the lottery commission you have to realize it's a lot of fun to go help someone when thirty pick up thirty million bucks\nSo here's how it works you call the lottery commission and say hey I have a winning ticket you have to get an appointment normally do the appointment in the morning\nThey will ask you a few questions because the ticket has other verify numbers on it beyond the main numbers look at a lottery ticket it's got other data on it so they'll ask you reduce the numbers the other numbers the verification numbers on the ticket you read them back the\nLottery commission will not say to you that your winter and they ... they don't do that until they verify it runs security and have you there and do a lot of background and then they will get some personal data and have you come in a day or two later\nSo you set up for the appointment you go to the lottery commission you take your ticket now\nThat these folks really liked me and trust me and they asked me if I take care of the ticket so how funny was that there are like state you know the ticket is an signed in severe instrument and it's worth thirty million dollars\nAnd they asked me to hold it of course I wouldn't hold it but I said look I'm going to meet you in Austin\nBut go put it in a safety deposit box have someone with you everywhere you go with this ticket till it's in there and when you drive to Austin I Want someone in a car behind you I don't think you'll have a record anything go wrong or get mugged but he just want people around what your curtains tickets so they did a safety deposit box or on the drive to Austin\nSo this is our story about my first plane to one thirty million and a lottery we get there in the lottery commission has an agenda the agenda\nIs they want you to be a big winner in an auditorium with press with filming and\nThey want to publicize the new one thirty million so they can go and advertise you think other people to buy\nNow they only have to report your name and where you're from and if it's not a big winning I mean if if it's if it's five or ten million bucks candidly is Steven Reich won five million and they set up from Dallas and live in some apartment complex there's almost no newspaper has this going to cover that\nCould you find that yes is it going to be a newspaper story probably not\nUm hey Russell I have a caller named Herman does he have a lottery question okay I'll finish my story Herman I'm I'm going to interrupt my story to take your call permanent Hi good morning welcome\nRunning\nHello hello go ... go go go go go oh how you doing it and I have to you know you get for weather glad it rained everything's good and I'm probably going to win one point six billion tonight the will not be on the radio anymore so you better on the air\nOr an odd I Love I Love your show you a quick question a lot of we we just had a conversation with uh some of our co workers and they were saying okay if you want this large amount of money so you take the lump sum so you take a thirty ... payments\nThey said well I always say allocate the thirty ... I Know they ... you know that's my decision but he said well if you do that if she died that said you don't get the rest of the money you know that's true\nWe meet they asked to see the ticket\nAnd um and then they say we need to take the ticket out in verify it to someone walks in the room takes your ticket and walk sauce\nNow I've been there through many meetings like this in every meeting the winters are always goes laughed and said hey be sure you don't run off with that bring it back [noise]\nThey'll verify it run it through a machine makes sure counterfeit check all kinds of things then they'll come back and say congratulations you're winter\nThan they have an attorney come in and kind of give you a little pep talk on hey there'll be stupid take your time get good advice in those types of things and they do have translators I was there with tennis panic see one at once and they everything was done in Spanish they brought in a translator for me to let me know what they were talking about\nSo as you go through the process they all say they want to know where do we spend the money you don't get a check when you're there they'll work within a couple of days to your account my client\nWas taking 'em payments over\nOver actually at that point it was Twenty years so their payments were thirty million over Twenty years one point five million a year after taxes and some other things you know they ended up eight nine hundred the lottery withheld twenty eight percent on the taxes by plane headed with all the rest\nSo they basically and then they did a full court press said we want to do publicity because if people know who you are find out who you are then they will bugs you\nMy advice was don't do any publicity but they wanted to so they did and actually they went to an auditorium at lottery headquarters\nAnd and the only people in the crowd were lottery employees but the lottery folks kind of empty the building brought everyone in so they could show a lot of folks like it was a real press conference then they tape them and they interviewed him and ah you had people clapped clapping et cetera um\nThey also do the store for channel the news\nSo after I was there doing this with like ... and my six or seven sweater\nThe attorney at the lottery I kinda got to know and we sit down and talk to one afternoon in she asked me how I happen to know so many people and that one I said well I Do talk radio show I was on channel two news I you know there was some let's see that as a financial God to help with it\nAnd I'm In we talked and you will figure it out you went to number one thing the lottery winners by my experience has been\nFord F. two fifty pickup truck afford to have two fifty pickup truck hey I had a client\nThat one like Thirteen million\nAnd they went out and bought a four and they bought a new house and then we can they bought the house he bought a Ford F two fifty and the two fifty would not fit in the garage so there there's a moral the story you go buy a new house and a big truck be sure of the truck fits in the garage\nOkay now I'm going to go in a moment to the tragic story of the client the one thirty million and ended up taking their life versus take a call from ... hey Jesse Hi good morning welcome [noise]\nHey you guys are I tell you my phone call so I can tell I win the lottery I guess I've got to keep working but uh [noise]\nUm I didn't hear a little bit of money from among the lesser and she left a a lot of it in ... and can you tell me a little bit about that day is it a good ... what's the role of editor phobia\nVirginia have fun and it sounds like a mutual fund that mortgage backed securities\nUm and so the mortgage is it is interest rate sensitive the typical Judy ... I'm thinking has a seven year average life but there are hundreds of\n... so you need to do more research so interest rates go up and you can drop in value it would not be considered as as safe as a CD and general it would have a less risk said in the stock market how much money as your mom leave you\nA almost a male okay are you married I Am\nOkay this is your separate property okay okay so here's what that means it's yours and it's not your spouse's now heaven forbid you get a divorce if that happened this is still your money I'm is or if you're if you're watching a car wreck and she sued it's your money\nIn okay and I love my son in laws but if I leave money to my daughter's some day I still want to separate property I got\nWife's mom died that left her money\nAnd we set it up and separate property\nJust as one of my wife and now look\nYou know what your money in separate I mean I'm I mean we all enjoy all the money right but\nIt's just important I think and I want it for my kids and I wanted it for my wife when she inherited money yeah here's the thing\nWhen you inherit that money can separate any interest and dividends or community property which means or half your wife's so if you said to me I Know separate property how do I keep it separate property here's how it works you have the account\nAlone by itself in your name you do not coming all other money in it which means you don't get your paycheck and put it in there you don't put your wife's ... chicken there anything you were in his community property you don't want to paint that were coming Gulen\nOkay and then once a year\nPainted or ...\nOkay and then once a year\nYou take out the interest and dividends and move it somewhere else\nSo you can also go to the attorney and drop a document that says hey I Know this is a separate property everybody agrees here's what it is leave the interest in evidence to separate property and do that\nSo but what you don't want to do\nI mean you might want to if
