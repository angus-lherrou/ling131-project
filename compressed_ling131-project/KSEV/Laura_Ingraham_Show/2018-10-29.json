they just won't find any pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC\nHe said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's

everybody understands what he's doing a for these people they have dug themselves into a whole here and they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham

remember when I was about what\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president doubt\nThey're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever ... says they're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president who has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts\nTo go and follow through\nMake Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but they will find any way to pick at President Trump fortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support\nHe won the election by forty two points when I get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately the reason why people are fleeing from Joe mansion is he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders\nHe supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWell why um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance and the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is really slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast that let them know but people do that on all the issues that matter not only maps in some parts of Hillary Obama but ... is not pro life\nA mansion supports Planned Parenthood mansions supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all\nIs that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion they move away from certain educational process what\nAbout the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing Joe mansion or voted for cabin on the end but\nA man that I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some ... treating someone who says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] was it that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first called on the Senate floor\nMatch in power and in fact he only came back to vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the capital of West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment surface this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nCap it off we know that\nFeinstein held that material for months why does she want it to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided in the bed it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used\nThat's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate rhetoric\nBut in reality when your first phone is to empower these radicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia and the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nOr in yeah he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw ... today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's coal killing rights at the U.S Supreme Court but that it does serve as a bridge\nTo President Trump and then he fell through on his promises which were on some of those crazy at a loss for ... and that's putting some miners backdoor now what we have a long way to do but\nThey're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling up the standard deduction and the lowering of the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities shows\nWhich are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's credit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he kind of goes back and forth and say well he was open that he wasn't\nThe reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for and that's not the kind of leadership we need but we are seeing a resurgence in West Virginia\nAnd you have to give this person that credit for so many good things he's done like taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this range very closely over the next to seven days

and has notoriety but their return was way less fit if they've been in the stock market I think the average about five and a half percent a year\nIt's interesting on collections or you know what let's

an amazing amazing a franchise amazing restaurant and um [noise]\nTo do a good job go to work for and put up ten grand maybe someday you two could run\nA chick fillet how long have you been in your house\nThe average American homeowners today and staying in their home longer than almost any time in recent history\nIn his interest rates go up and new mortgages get more expensive I think you'll see people saying in even longer\nThe average American today it's been in their house eight point three years and what's interesting is there some cities where people stay there a long long time\nIn fact the Tom top nine metro areas with a long and someone or ten years Raul in Connecticut or Massachusetts\nSeven or in California\nSo in some parts of the country and you think of New England and getting that place on four acres they just stay there and they don't move\nThere ... metro areas with really high turnover including often Denver, Colorado springs in Oklahoma City so in\nBridgeport, Connecticut for war Chester or Springfield, Massachusetts the average person said that their house Thirteen Years\nIn Oklahoma City is six to seven years the national average eight point three\nSo if you're saying in your house longer joined the majority when I see people that have done a really good job of accumulating money typically they keep the same spouse and they keep the same house for a long period of time\nTo read one article on second homes that said the average person that vice a second home spends about fifty percent more\nOn the second home they knew their primary house and I I think that makes perfect sense I see that all the time because I don't want to love everybody into two areas\nBut like I Know a man in a world class\nThat random business worked their tail off saving their same house and they live in a three hundred thousand dollar home with their probably paid a hundred for when they bought it and they bought it three million dollar range and they basically just said you know what we had everything we need\nAnd we didn't want to move up\nHouse to house summit match into the mansion so some people will say in the same house\nAnd get paid for and then some folks and then with this all paid for it to avoid all our for they reach out to the second home\nAnd then some people will just go McMahon should we mentioned bigger house bigger house by the big in South statistically when they're forty nine years old close to the peak income\nAnd it never gets a second home so I've always been really curious about the second home financially\nAnd the curious about what is the benefit of the second home\nSo I Do have clients on occasion cool by\nTheir retirement house a few years before they retire they want to get paid for you to landscape furnished get everything done and I I totally understand that\nSo financially it's really unusual and I'm someone that's had a second home most of my life so much to talk about why they're not doing it on the calculator I Know it doesn't make sense make financial sense\nBut financially you take the money you tie up in the financial or in a second home if it's invested in you take\nThe furniture and utilities in the yard work appears in the country the driveway the pond the\nFencing the septic for\nWater well and then when you maintain it and pay property taxes on it if you just held on to all that money you could take the most amazing vacations in the world go to wherever you wanted to go\nAnd financially a second home does not make a lot of sense I have ... clients of ark theme that rented a home in Wales next August two hundred year old stone cottage three bedroom high speed Internet\nAll bills paid in a beautiful area for twenty eight hundred bucks for the whole month\nGolly twin hundred bucks we'll go over in front of a second home will tell you that wherever some other clients that their return home and Arizona spend three four grand to get a house with a swimming pool there are there a month they know where to play golf or to go out and eat they've done it like Fifteen Twenty years it's like suck it up\nBut they don't have insurance upkeep painting anything at all\nSo financially says it's not going to\nMake sense really doesn't now\nWhy do people have second homes if it doesn't make sense financially here's the most unusual second home\nStory I Know one of the most so I Know a couple\nAnd I'm One of them it's a corridor H O R D ER\nAnd one of them can't throw anything away\nEver\nAnd they I mean I'm sure most of us have some things that our kids did

executive within oil company in one of them has a job\nBack home in another state and they lived apart for twenty five years\nSo the but what we see each other okay but the one that lived in the other state\nHas so much stuff in the house are you ready for this that that when the Houston part of the couple would go home to house who's so full\nThey have to leave their suitcase in the car\nOutside can you imagine going home to see your spouse you still married but\nHouses so full you have to leave the suitcase in the car and go out and get stuff okay so they did not have a second home anywhere to go with the south out of state would come here a lot that was kind of freedom\nSo what they did was when the spouse in Texas retired they built a brand new house and the style\nThey built a brand new house and the style suit tend to save a lot of things got the basement huge for basement to put their stuff and now and then there are obviously ongoing negotiation and things that go with that so anyway there you go\nNow second home we don't financially doesn't work the money's tight up the taxes the decorating utilities everything with it if you took that money you could vacation anywhere in the world\nBut they're the fun of a second home is the anticipation of going the good thoughts and\nNot I don't want to major or drink comparison to the person that hoarded but the freedom of going somewhere and not having all your regular stuff around\nYou so when we go to second home so we got second homes in round top which I sold\nA couple of made really good money and then we built in front of a one hour drive to my office uh depending on traffic um\nTo go there on the weekend and realize that I that the tax returns stuff I needed to do was up there you know I mean just get away from stuff and we're not we have empty drawers we don't pack\nEverything yeah we aggressively throw things away but there's just something fresh nice about the second home kind of getting away [noise] so have a client who is an executive\nHad an energy company they have a second home in Colorado and\nThey go they get great memories but what is a stressful day his wife will just Texan a picture of alpha Colorado and say hey we'll be up their Christmas believe all this behind so does it does it make financial sense for them probably not\nBut it's a place to go they love doing it when we had a home in round top Texas I was really amazed at\nHow many how easy it was to be socially engaged so most people have a hobby or something they do they enjoy the hobby but the people that go with that right or what they enjoy relationship proven\nSo like if I did they often used to I could walk around and you know I might be somewhat of a restaurant or no probably not but I could around top I go in the bank and see people certainly at the Merck until I could see people\nUm if I were just got out and walked around equal square something I Would always see people I Know [noise] so [noise] second homes don't make financial sense they usually are more expensive as the primary home there is pride of ownership\n[noise] oh [noise]\nA lot of country homes the average person's only there five years
