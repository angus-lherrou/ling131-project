won or happy that that the Senate eventually got to the right result and an outstanding I'm a conservative or justice was confirmed\nAnd the other hand I think all of us are\nDepressed about how how awful how awful the process was that the mirrors to which a judge Kavanaugh on his family were were subjected and the other dishonesty how the Democrats and tried to be re all his nomination\nBy any means necessary including mob action in Washington DC we'll be talking about that aspect of it later in the uh as the show continues\nAnd as usual when you have these political dramas you've got heroes and you've got villains right a hero's include um Mitch McConnell a McConnell has sometimes been been criticized by my view the Senate is that because of the a filibuster\nThe the majority leader of the Senate um tend to look like a it tends to look in a factual and the minority leader of this and that\nTends to look like a tactical genius you know usually that's not true a ad and um I I I think Mitch McConnell knows how to work at it as well as anybody but um when the filibuster is in play ah the majority leader is often a rather I'm paralyzed\nThe filibuster is not in play here of course\nAnd then we we'll a debt of gratitude to Harry Reid for a busting the filibuster as to judicial nominees now it was in effect only for a short time the Democrats put the filibuster into

interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin or a prior to his death and I think he is not a guide Neal if you if you then you know well like president and the voting I I think he would have supported a cabin or [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was just a question of are you you never knew when he was a whole row and and the bad that his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nA ... and and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing all of Obamacare\nEvil or to keep it as apparently he did that just a fights or because of his anger at a President Trump [noise]\nSo he was a loose cannon is a lot of ways and I think over over each time and there's a you became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think that the the person that with respect to what your theory vice chair of the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham you know let me grab was always the junior maverick er he was always a he was always John McCain's a white man on him and I'm and I'm with McCain are gone\nAnd then maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah

here are saying that Brett\nKavanaugh will be confirmed that the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history the Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork and Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but this Flanders the Democratic party directed toward cabin or were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's caused there for a moment at the smears they directed against a judge war were outraged of Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there were many Democrats participating\nAt least they were they were a year toward his judicial philosophy which they massively just started the lied about [noise] but they but they did it lead to relate just think you might do it the ... the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh with total Boy Scout\nA window involved in in gang rapes as a high school student I Believe a bowl or the mirrors that the the slander they they directed against ah against judge Kavanaugh [noise] so I continued a bunch of slander as the Democratic party directed toward cabinet or worry\nIf anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years um [noise] I laid out various areas which I think which I think that's true where I think we

the slightest\nI doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nGuy that that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when the cabinet on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think we're ... the accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was here and I and I thought it said that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was your emotional Vern her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that it Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said\nYou are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges\nAnd I'm not going to play along with this I I think that he he very much helped his uh his claws and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of his nomination\nWhich I knew John Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit on talking about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participate or maybe don't need to be respected if their clubs\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because it involved itself in\nMore and more social issues frankly under the constitution on the left to people but you know that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had with greater Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving a distraction at Trump's policies nobody was filing a motion to get her a to draw away and nobody express the kind of outrage\nCourts her we're talking about race but not nearly the level of outrage at your heritage beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh or who all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side the judiciary\nA committee you know the impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeached by the capital and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote\nIn the Senate before somebody has actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to the cabinet so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the creed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but those are the Democrats who showed up as a mob in Washington D. C. and invaded senators' offices and all the things that they did a tax Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked my plan is so great is I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there with with cameras confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there was a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been craze uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nFor folks are on the left have been predicting the demise of roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to farm\nOr wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any entity Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nOr would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited in overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be out like over conned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's how cases it tended to come to the court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states it would have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it\nIs full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly\nOh on roe versus Wade I don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the corner I had no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn

officeholders they've a salted Republican officeholders\nThey lost a so called protesters to Republicans homes to try to frighten them and especially frightened their children\nAre they invade a

going back to ... uh the attacks on other congressman before it's\nA what we saw on television and I'm sitting there wondering where is the Courier Journal worse but just as surely by now there are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet I saw when I was on the air here where\nSomebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action in Washington in this most recent uh go round [noise]\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got and chief Assad is\nA rioting in your city smashing store for us you know breaking up a\nPlaces of business are hitting people over the head with baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and sending cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecute him arrest them put them in jail and if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at him you know these people deserve long jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the kind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that that the activist wing of the military wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute and they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd uh so I think that's where that's where the enforcement really needs to be again is that the state and local level or the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened in his house in a lab and in Wisconsin with a newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give the union members that choice\nGovernor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give the union members that choice public union members that choice and paying dues to remember the hundred thousand protesters bystanders\nOn all over the country over the capital was terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital [noise] ah they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to boxers were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it's scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot\nAh there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about it Governor Scott Walker he went all the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly\nA strong the governor's good strong and the book is called and intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red\nThere were set attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of wake county's lawsuit everything you're saying now a happen in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budget and Wisconsin\nI'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nIllinois or the or democratic legislators ran in here so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that right man\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party expose where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel [laughter] it was just you know you couldn't carry out a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process\nAnd by the way organizing for America the Wisconsin branch was busy there that was Obama's group to house and they'll have an act can

reaching the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is that is really a transformative\nTo uh to grow their businesses how they see fit is that is really a transformative across the board\n[noise] it really is you know I I check the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis uh currently\nAnd I chose a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he had\nUm and and a strong approval rational causes the approval and the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of you know meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero that doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval and actually mine is eleven\nSo Trump's at this moment is eleven points better so we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something or what do you think Adam are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it from a beach\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above it both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future\nUh it it really is a stark discrepancy between the two futures there are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan ripped you'll Trump tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs to be average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax\nCut that ... ... ... last year and the economic growth is projected over over the future to\nTax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars a loft take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that's a\n... that that that should be scared to to most Americans that they all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the er what by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that the house and the Senate and then have as a threat\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter and he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemy soft answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela and he said yeah if the Democrats get their way uh you know all these social it's they're popping up now they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was very glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing their successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out his socialist [noise]\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages and socialism because there are no more pets around the country the pet to have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you know the the the record of of socialism that something might eighty fixing zero it's been tried more times than it should have been at each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and and left misery and destruction at wake and so I mean that's the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two the two direction you can shoot\nThe comment of the ... of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money in that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of lost around blind people's pockets and then\nA part of that yet ... bad back out elsewhere that that is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy American than American businesses no how best to spend and invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're a part of the ... the socialist in crowd yeah you can do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry him up for dinner and have that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially for the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs\nThat are Michelle thank you very much for being on the program we appreciate it we've got to run to a break now we're going to come

and we also\nI'm Talking about money related topic our goal is to stimulate your thinking and you go wow maybe I should be thinking about this baby or I'll do something a little smarter financially\nI'm not a psychologist\nAnd if you listen to show off and you might say see Steve you're not much of anything but um I Do observe it was incredibly interesting about my job in Alberta is talking about that for a moment and\nThen share some ideas what's interesting is I sit down with people every day that it's safe and accumulated money and they I see how they did it um\nHow much they say how long they say what they invested in what the spin I usually have a sense of hell if they're happy or unhappy\nAnd it's just it's interesting because I understand it\nIn our world that our society we don't talk about what we have the other people okay\nSo\nI also believe that we over estimate what other people have\nI read a survey study\nAnd then asked people how many friends they had and how many friends their friends bad\nAnd they typically said oh by friends have way more friends than me when I meet with two people who work together there maybe they know each other one might be quiet and they were further friend\nInevitably if I meet with Mr Jones to Mr Smith and they're good friends\nMr Jones or Mrs Jones will say well I'll just spent several way for buddy that up and the Joneses will say oh or or the Smith will say the jokes have more money the judge said with the students that are more\nMoney so we often think that people have more money\nMore money so we often think that people have more money than we do now when you see someone that looks like they have a lot of money\nOff than say they don't because\nEverything you see costs money and that's where their money is I see people\nWho have a million two million three million for a million and they drive the same car for ten years of very happy in their house they uh they really don't change things up very much\nIn fact the typical person with money since more at Sears and they do it and even mark as they might drive a car six or seven years I Know a really wealthy family and when I say well the the way more money than the either retired\nAnd they buy a new car every five years and they have two cars\nSo like killed by a car\nIn two thousand ten she'll get one and two thousand Fifteen he'll get one and two thousand twenty\nAnd when I asked him how do you how did you do figure this out of luck cars last longer today than they used to we always want one car this five years old or less and then if we have a long trip will take the nicer car\nAnd they don't think about it they don't worry about it that their program they said money aside will they have a lot of money but they don't look like they have a lot of money so when people talk about let's talk about investing and things that we see better since ... not successful\nAre the ... the classic mistake in investing is that you want to do the one big deal that will get you there and I think we all know someone looking for\nThe one big deal most people who were successful financially pages so first they pay themselves automatically and they make conventional investments and they just plug along\nAnd they really get rich slowly and it doesn't take a lot of money to ... a million dollars if you said consistently and invest in something that grows\nIn fact if you had or twenty five year old couple\nStarting a yard that Phil stone and gravel and filter right it's related it's a person is an oil company that creates a device that goes on a drilling rig that makes life easier so what happens is if you're in an area of expertise\nAnd you see an opportunity often people gravitate there and make a lot of money here's what I don't see\nI don't see the doctor\nWho buys the apartment complex\nOccasionally could he do well yeah you might do well but really there's a lot of really savvy apartment complex investors that there might be a reason they're not in it\nLike hey I Know a doctor and invested in a banana plantation in the Central American company country um\nAnd then he paid a lot of money got everything running first class right here really knocks been in operation he found out there are only two companies in this Central American country that by distribute bananas and they put the squeeze on him and ... you have a tough time ever make any money from it\nEnded up actually buy it from it so\nWhen I see folks who invest in areas where they have the expertise that often works when I see people get outside the area of expertise and do things that are liquid or have large mark up I'd see problems\nThe nice thing is there's a way in most parts of the most environments over long term that people can do investments in do well and it keeps it really really simple\nAnd I talked to some of this morning and they basically had an investment ID it it was outside of kind of a Wall Street world and\nI said you know what I figure it out for me I Want it simple I Want to straightforward I Want things like understand and I'm not going to go outside\nThe box keep things plugging away [noise] so when folks accumulate money\nWe often look at them and there have been censored they're doing something and we wouldn't have thought of it\nAnd we asked the question are they really smart\nOr or they are or they lucky okay\nThere's a series of podcasts and it's on your phone like you have an iPhone go look at podcast and it's how I built this and it's a series of interviews with people that have successful companies or Mark Cuban with the Dallas Mavericks are ... the guy that started\nBe we work uh Samuel Adams beer really the podcast or super interesting\nOut of the severe really the podcast or super interesting as you can hear people discuss their success and how they got there so the gentleman that interview Colombians part canceling since the folks\nIs that luck where you lucky or were you smart and\nMark Cuban I thought had a very interesting answer he's like I was lucky that I became a billionaire he goes I could get to be a millionaire pretty easily he said I Would\nFind their product go into sales build a company and I can't get to a million bucks no big deal but to be a billionaire you have to be lucky\nMost people in these podcast or that of course successful and wealthy or articulate they're interesting they sound fair minded and you can listen literally for moments and say well they've got going on\nWe often have our parents and someone tell us the harder you work the last few you get\nI give a couple of speeches the college students that TCU individual school every year\nAnd I've always thought said luck I called it deal flow I said someone who's out interacting connecting talking to folks there the deal flow there luckier and things work better\nSocial psychologist Richard Wiseman from Britain a professor at a university or hurt for ... has studied how this luck work why does it play a role in our life\nAnd I've always known this intellectually and I've seen it in talking to people about money but when I read his study the light bulb went off\nAnd I'm like this guy has nailed it\nSo if you want to be lucky there are things you can do to get lucky which totally contribute success and can easily translate into making more money\n\nWeitzman found lucky people for significantly higher on extra version they're extroverts they smile twice as often they engage in more eye contact they're sociable and here's the thing\nThey meet more people they connect better they maintain relationships and so they see more opportunities\nI Am a friend in real estate and it drives his wife crazy he never goes home in the same route because he's looking at real estate\nHe's going down side roads looking into commercial buildings make it knows he can't get enough of it he does it on Sunday afternoon\nHe's in the deal flow he's checking things out I Know a guy that had an amazing career\nAnd he left that after four years to a much better job and he recently left that change feels that now he's into raising physician\nWell how does he make those moves he's an extrovert he meets people he smiles thinking like him he's also incredibly confident\nI had a Great Britain in college one of the smartest most organized nights this incredible people I've ever known\nBut no one knew it a few people knew it\nHe got a job but it S P five hundred company probably won't actually one of the five biggest companies in Houston\nAnd he did point\nBut he never promoted himself he never met people you'd never went to the mic department and said what's going on here he never took a new person that once he didn't know any set okay put it really wasn't\nRecognized lucky people grow up with a new experience since they're more willing to talk to the new people travel to new places try new things\nAnd the professor when he looked at him it was just dramatic difference he saw so then he said\nHey can we make people walk here can you coach someone and\nSee if they can get lucky here things go their way so he set up a law school a lot L.
