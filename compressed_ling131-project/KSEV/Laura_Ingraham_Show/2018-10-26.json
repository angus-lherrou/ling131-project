every definition of the word invasion this is an invasion ...\nAbsolutely I Believe me I see no dictionary definitions I wasn't in the force of large numbers coming to try to cross the border

postal worker you can help a a elucidate us on this ...\nDid you say drawing or Sean I said John John here are the worst yeah average just as I was\nA I work for the postal service as a clerk here and I throw him postmaster for ten and a half years after my uh twenty seven years or for ill for service anyway\nRussia's not better unusual when you consider the characteristics so these packages [noise] um I don't I have received things from the Mayo personally that are the things that are more into a calculator or something with stamps on narrative not been cancelled plow in the region or

something that could do damage\nYeah it would have waited too much and it would have alerted people feel there's something wrong with this sort of it's not gone through a clerk clerk at the counter who care to ask them questions and camp for over ... stamp\nSure so for the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nAnd she lives in ... who are running short on time here but real quick so without it being cancelled how would they be able to track some back from New York to Florida\nWell actually that's probably a sort of basing it on the fact that one of them was male and then ended up with a ... million returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got pretty eyes a lot more clever than right or\nWhether it's an open I appreciate that that is that is incredibly

because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like it on this issue and they hadn't gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitated these care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it as leverage on them particularly the trade\nHappened I'm Sorry I don't know but this is what's happened in Europe I mean look\nElaborate on that particular the trade\nCenter happened I'm Sorry I don't know but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you had a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle leads coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated and crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their content was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nIs talk of the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in\nUh in Arizona and California and watch you know there's high winds at that travel right along the border I won't say five five I don't remember I Know it's on I talk to them because north south I think it's ten interstate time goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border scary prospect if people are not coming into commit harm but the idea of something like a simple walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me and I'm thinking as he was on the eve\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a phobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about the danger of course border here's the reality the president was ... by the way when he said that there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was called here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right a website the Laredo station at the border patrol tells us that this year and they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis are crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what\nI'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic hairs are the reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here\nFrom Bangladesh even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think is very short and tells us you know that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair\nTo legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way it it that doesn't work if it comes to it we'll see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope you don't have to get that trick pony and but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the prices of them actually\nCrossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way you understood that I was looking for his interstate eight minutes south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California I'm against the Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back\nTo the Senate thing about being a phobia and I've also make it very clear and said that's a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut that wasn't one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is offensive anybody can come to America and become an American\nCitizen then is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan and the same thing Korea the same thing but anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the problems you have to do it legally you can't you cannot expect\nIs you're going to come up here on moss and and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates Ponzi ... I don't believe that it does having read the very statutes that are out there where do you come down on us\nRight now I don't think so because it's a clear danger to our orders external danger so you know I don't think it doesn't I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make us a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call us race of course and and try to dismiss us well here's here's the reality ah America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become illegal immigrant and you're so light the second you are you're an American\nNo questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship and it is about more is and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting American citizens many of whom happened to be minorities\nA black and Hispanic Americans I Believe soccer more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration a why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market\nAgainst illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my my my my colleague motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal about that issue about the sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it come down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nI if we don't control who is migrating here ah them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon find himself without a nation and we certainly don't want that sea of Cortez how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights we honor and we're not tonight and on Twitter on at court as the C O R G E S C\nI Will listen I appreciate that will put up when somebody underlying or show page I'm sure we have one up in ... thank you so much for joining us today Thanks for having me free and it's interesting 'cause he was talking about the issues of of people of color in America are\nAnd one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really did get a chance to get to was the issue of uh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to impose at the White House today and then they're doing the gala event tonight here in Washington DC\nUh you know president is really doing what he can because\nRight it it's funny or the American dream is about everybody is about everyone is about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of economic news today on the the we have the GDP out a GDP is it the third quarter GDP a three point five percent I'm above\nTenth of a percentage point above where it would have stuck to that it's a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I had to get them I've as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew\nPlaying something ah every two seconds when I get excited to happen when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately to that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me and Andrew underscore Langer Patty rides I found you a good job filling in for Laura we need evidence confirmed is this the liberal sending the bombs I it must be one idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't ...\nSo I mean the bombs I it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have rights than confront something am I going to go back and look about I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly center folks at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that when we got a couple of minutes here on the show\nBefore recalls out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at the end you're on the shoreline gr continue to take your phone calls\nEight five five forty Laurie is the number eight five five four zero L.

right as long as long as it's not a lime green shag were were good\n[noise] so my wife tells me that my twenty five thirty year old clothes even though they've come back can't be worn by me she said no you can wear them but you have to buy a new um what's the difference just said you just told you can't do that or you just can't fit in well that may be because I Know I Can't [laughter]\nThat's what happens over time we get a little larger I I'm not sure why that is fluffy yeah there you go Chris Clark is my guest\nI was gonna say kitchen about creations that I'm going to the kitchen about creations K NBC's The abbreviated name\nLet's talk a little bit about your design center just show room and a lot of people in your industry work out of their truck or their house but you actually have a place yeah most people can come yet and put ... you know pieces together and actually design with your expertise\nWell we opened up our showroom almost nine years ago\nAnd the reason that the way that whole thing came about is I was one of those guys way back when working I mean that's how I started I did all the work myself I worked out the back of the truck I mean when I started it was me and a five hundred dollar bill\nHas got two hundred and forty dollars bought a new job so I took two hundred and sixty bucks and put it in the green sheet and we went to work [noise] and uh\nWe you know we we've grown we've grown we've grown we open up the show room but back in the old days you know when we designed a kitchen or bathroom by the time we went to the grand store we went to the cabinet store went to the tiles store then we went to ... or more supply the plumbing store\nYou're looking at eight hours a day riding around in a vehicle trying to make selections\nThey have TV does that do that where the host of the show drives them around all the shot it it it's crazy and then they may not God Forbid you know we get to the granted store and they say oh man I Wish we would have picked out this dial up back in the drug back to go get the other tile\n[noise] so I open up and design center I'm designing whole houses and an hour and a half um incredible what we do is we're full service so not only do we build it but we also designer and uh when we bring on new customers I Will actually give them a homework assignment\nAnd it's going on a website like house and other places and so they can look at pictures and you know you you may not know what it's called but you know what you like and the picture's worth a thousand words so they always\nTell people I'm sure you go to a home show or before we go to a design center before that contractor shown pictures out of magazines Internet some well\nBack in the old days that's what I did I showed up with a stack of remodeling books and ten thousand posts and hear show me what you like so when they get that homework assignment back me they look at these pictures and they put notes on the pictures [noise]\nUm what I Do is I put together a complete design package for them I as a starting point so I Will pick out cabinet countertops tile actress faucet sinks and while put together a whole pile of form and then I then I bring them into the office and we sat down and we talk about it\nSo you you kind of um build it in a proposal and then we find that based on what they want after they see it because there has to be something to refine so you really help them get through to a point it's a foundation\nIt's it it's it's it's crazy how easy it is um when people come into the show room and they have and we don't do this process [noise]\nThey're a little overwhelmed with all the amount of product we have I'm sure so it's just kind of like oh my gosh where to start so by doing this would that come into the show room you'd be surprised how many how many times my design sessions like three minutes\nThat come in and they look at it oh my God we love it they turn around and leave really Oh absolutely\nSo you really have a good idea of what you believe the client it's going to want\nOh yeah and I mean I'm looking at him they'd picked out a picture they said I liked his picture now they they need to put notes on the pictures mhm so\nFor example when when when I look at it at the picture I don't know what they're like about it so I tell them put notes on it I Love the topic for it I really liked the dollar cabinet but I Wish it wasn't whites\nThat type of thing\nAnd then based off all that information then I I Do when I go to work and I make that entire selection process for them\nHow much time does that take it sounds time consuming for you it's a lot less than having them they're trying to do with you so you're doing it alone 'cause you know what you need to do\nIt just starting point yeah I mean it doesn't take me long oh man I've been doing this for years and then the meaning of time at all [noise]\nYou know I mean I can honestly when I when I started looking at that that somebody's a homework for lack of a better term and you know I'm looking at their pictures I'm reading their notes that maybe takes ten minutes\nAnd then okay I Know what they want and I'll go out and go on my shirt room and start pulling samples and land everything out on their design table and getting ready for\nLet me give out your phone number really quick write this down everybody to eight one seven one seven six eight to eight That's Chris is number two eight one goes directly to him to wait one seven one seven six eight to eight\nLet's talk about the rats up things that you guys do I mean it's everything you could build an entire house and then go from you\nYou guys do I mean it's everything you could build an entire house and then go from you know backwards from there correct\nUm see my backgrounds military contracts I chased military bases for Eighteen years there's nothing I Can't build fabricate engineer installed um you know we have a deep heritage in our family you know in the trades\nI'm electrician by trade that's how I started out now I did not know that no I don't you for for years yeah years and years I started I started out when I got out of the marine corps I started out in the electrical fields and uh that's where we got our teeth [noise]\nUm you know we we've done a lot of crazy thing for customers so anything from the from the interior ex you're either home we build pools I've got free pools in production this week\nI'm you know we we don't advertise it and we added heeded decay in the hobby [laughter] yeah right [laughter] right [noise] um\nWe don't advertise it but I'm a project we're doing right now that customer or a huge lot\nHad uh about nine hundred feet offense and he says man I Need to get my students and Chris can you do sense for me absolutely so we're building fences you know so everything from the interior of the home cabinets countertops showers flooring so I'm not you name it we do it\nTo the holidays are coming up is there still time for people to get the project's done um can you've asked you to do a kitchen small bathroom big bathroom obviously you can't build a house between now and then what can you help my listeners with\nRight now the best thing for them to do is call and we can talk about the the size and scope of their project\nUm this time of year I call it the grind so we are coming into the holidays so there's a lot of people that oh my God I just found out my mother in law's coming so that's that's frightening though ... an hour and a lot of room lot a lot of smaller projects\nUm you know just going into an ...\nWe had a um [noise] it's about four years ago she found out through story mother in law's coming into town\nRight mhm [noise]\nThis is that the five days before Thanksgiving okay and she doesn't get along with their mother in law so she books a cruise and you know [laughter] she says I Want the whole house painted inside now\nThirty two hundred square foot home from my goodness and I said man you're going to pay five times the going rate she says I don't care what it costs I have to have it painted before the mother in law gets here because all she's going to do is complain about the dirty walls\nAnd I said okay we're gonna have to run twenty four seven\nRound the clock to make this happen and we did a wow we put we painted that house inside and out in five days\nI was running three ... three crews twenty four hours a day flood lights on my I mean it sounds like an expensive opera it was crazy like it was crazy so Thanksgiving comes and goes\nAnd about three days after Thanksgiving I give her a car and I don't have them how to go [noise]\nI Hope she liked it and she said no no all she did was complain about the pain smell\nCan't fleas some heat it was it was awkward it was awkward but you know until they called I talk to them I I don't know what I can can or can't show in that timeframe sure but we can get a lot done you\nCan get a lot done especially if they want to get it done to wait one seven one seven six to eight to eight write it down and put it in your phone better yet to wait one seven one seven six eight\nTo eight so we talked about the fact I've been doing it for very long time um but what doesn't take a very long time it's for you to get back\nTo your client with numbers happens quickly you go in\nRight now when I Do my estimates so on the initial um visit when I'm when I come out to the house um depending on the sides of project normally it's thirty forty five minutes for a kitchen or bathroom that type of thing I Will be able to give them budgetary numbers before I leave\nI Can't give 'em to make to the penny number\nBut but I'm a pretty darn good idea right so we haven't picked out any collections yet right so I don't know what the material costs is going to be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "26"}
