known name brand car dealership\nSix months ago\nAnd there were some measure but on the brakes and they said it was like four millimeters and they sort of big instead of three millimeters we need to replace the breaks\nSo he just took it back in\nAnd they checked it out and said look at the brakes on they called him and they they said you're five millimeters of room you're not even close to break job\nSo what you've got is he's like okay so I had it in before and the breaks we're closer than eating done six months later the breaks or moral is obviously\nThe brakes are closely meeting done six months later the breaks or moral is obviously or he thinks the first person\nGave you a really bad information and he's wondering where were the stupid did they make a mistake or were they trying to sell me something I didn't need\nSo mechanics are paid on commission\nBy the work that they do have many shops mechanic shows up they're expected to have their own tools I suspect there are good and bad mechanics just like there are good and bad dentist and go to the doctors and good at that good or bad financial advisors\nUm you know I Know of a dentist and he sells every body a a six hundred dollar bill guard\nWill your age and your teeth are quite what they used to be I see a little crack here um it's just you know he's he's I think he probably went to a seminar and someone said look\nIf you have you know salvage clients and you get three hundred environmental guard at six hundred bucks a piece of your income goes up by belts than a month I so so I don't think mechanic three different than anyone else or some people are amazing in sub were selling a little bit my friend was just saying you know what\nMaybe it was the end of the month of mechanic like to do break jobs you know um\nBut it is interesting I Would think\nFor quality control I don't know if this really happens that car dealers should be checking recommendations\nSold the financial world doesn't mean you get the best recommendations all the time but there's a level of compliance a level of checking a level of supervision um and I think it's all fine I always like other ideas\nI Know some of the recently changed firms who um make good impressive presentation but they didn't like supervision\nThey just didn't like supervision so um who's supervisors mechanics I really I don't know\nMy son who is uh getting ready to graduate with a double major from teach you you\nWent to give these oil change one day\nAt a a major car wash that also has an oil services that are next door\nAnd he is compliant\nThat Exxon your apartment store they try to give you sign up for a credit card to get a cash discount now I think I've heard that Joseph Banks underwater major credit card companies\nDo it yeah I wouldn't do it I mean if I sit in a thousand bucks on clothes\nAnd I could do that because they only shop once or maybe twice a year and then I go in like lightning and I'm not really fast I'm not a big shopper\n[noise] and they offered me two hundred bucks to get their credit card\nOr twenty percent off I just wouldn't do it I don't want the headaches I don't want to keep up with that on one of my credit score\nSo nearly half forty seven percent of Americans have had a store base credit card have said they regret their choice to get it that's according to surveys Fifteen hundred people by listening tree I'm wealthy Americans are more likely to be a store credit card and regret it\n[noise] eighty percent of households with the annual link kind of a hundred thousand or more habits or credit card and most of them are credited\nSo\nWhy wouldn't you want him to her credit card well\nThe average annual percentage rate for store credit card is twenty four point nine seven percent that's according according to compare cards and that's really higher than the average credit card rate which you can see it credit cards dot com\nSo a retail cars are often co branded they might have these uh in the department store discover they have a slightly lower rate only twenty three point two percent\nBut if the retailer issue to directly it was twenty ... twenty seven percent\nSo really interesting um I just don't see a reason to have that now a survey was done\nAmong\nConsumers and it's sad if you're getting your credit card are you worried about the interest rate how important is that and the majority\nSaid that's not important at all I don't care about the interest rate would have paid off every month\nBut most people don't pay it off every month they end up paying higher interest rate that crazy thinking about interest rate of twenty four percent of the credit card and again this summer even higher than that\nI always find it interesting what a rich person pays a lot of money for something\nSo uh Nineteen eighty five Porsche\nRecently sold at auction actually this past weekend they thought it was so between three and three point four million and it sold for six million\nThe highest price car that ever sold was a Nineteen Seventy Porsche nine one seven K integrating auction in August of last year\nSeventy Porsche nine one seven K including auction in August of last year they go forward teen million so this is really really rough rule of thumb\nIt is believed that it high priced auctions high priced daughter you know items it could be art it can be a classic car that some people will spend up to three percent\nOf their net war on an item that certainly some people spend more but three percent of your network seems to be manageable number for some incredible waterfall collectible item so\nFor someone to buy six million dollar cars are probably worth two hundred million dollars two hundred and eighty bucks\nIf somebody buys a million dollar painting there probably were thirty million bucks and that's important and they love the painting six million bucks for a car I'm looking at it [noise] it's not that pretty cars sold it's crazy huh for\nAlmost six million dollars over ... won five five eight five seven three eight so rising is rolling out tied to the Internet in Houston in some areas now not for their telephones but for their home Internet\n[noise] so on the Internet at your house at some point you might have had dial up on your phone I have that Twenty years ago by twenty five years ago\nThen you really started sizzling if you got cable\nAnd then you get fiber optic in its progress in this got faster and faster\nThis new five gee technology is expected to be as fast or faster than fiber optic cable

tracked geographically within centimeters\nBut five jeez rolling out their spending a lot of money it's amazing how fast it is\nI'm really be fun to have all that ... you know you watch anything once in a movie on your phone or just that the doctor's office if you want to do five gee it's gonna fly fly fly our numbers games to eight one five five eight seven three eight Hi George or can you can see the good morning\nI'm Steve I was listening to your program this morning and I heard the incident with your your son and the\nCar yeah and I don't know if you\nAre aware of this strategy but I think using it for years what I Do is I keep a three ring binder in my car\nAnd when I get a a service offered or something like that I got the strict environmental spreadsheet on top\nAnd can tell when I asked services done and I had those folks try to get me to change oil and editors and stuff when there's been absolutely no leach need for\nA an hour on a national little shown a what I have on record nasty the filter\nAnd uh you know that that standard strategy in what they try to do or not that bill\nSo I didn't have a mechanic tell me that an air filter\nIs they that they are often sold it appropriately because they could look dirty really fast and all you have to do is blowed out and really your fault and\nThat's true too so\nOn my tractor whatever we changed an oil filter we write to date on the oil filter and the hours and that's how I keep up with it you keep a three ring binder that's much better in all so much more sophisticated so he\nWas one thing I've actually been able to do it one time I had an incident where cholera cares and I went back to the binder and found out that twelve months before I had to repair done for that very same area of the car\nAnd adult type work in the water and wound up getting a warrant the repair done because I had all the paperwork and was within their twelve months guarantee\nOr you engineer now are you a detail guy short yes okay good for you\nWell and so the big thing today will say that you go buy a Ford truck\nAnd you know for you know obviously holds back a little money shirt with the dealership [noise] put forward will penalize a dealer if they don't have a certain percentage of people signed up their vehicles in the forest computer system\nSo like on the Cadillac if you're a Cadillac\nAnd there are different levels you can sign up for what it will track in the Cadillac will send you an email when you need a certain level of service or you need an oil change they track all that electronically\nAnd then they follow up with you which makes you want to get into the dealer board has the same thing but you have to sign up for us\nSo the last pickup truck I bought was a new pickup before my previous four vehicles had all been bought used but I bought a new one I Love the technology\nBut the dealer call me and they said hey the person you're dealt with didn't hookup your you know into the Ford system I can help you I Want you to get online and do these things so they can cut attract your truck and the oil usage at all that and I was really busy and I said hey I'm too busy to go out to my truck and
