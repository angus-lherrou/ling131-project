right what what are you better than the older and they're not criminals will ... will [laughter]\nThey have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de

you you go to a port of entry anything I claim asylum then we'll have to process them into the country then we do know that for them so we release some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI I I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political pressure\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed there's there's no such thing as economic asylum it's only political asylum and so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just come here to to\nTo you know to yourself off on society without giving in the back of these people a word water to their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go

at I've said across the\nTable and gone through details of way way way north or a billion dollars of folks to save money a million two million three million at a time\nSo I Want to talk about quickly what's good about having somebody and socks what's bad about money in stocks\nWith the recent sell off on our Facebook page we've posted an article every Wednesday\nAnd then we put an article out last Wednesday about the equity sell off um pros and cons of the shake out\nAnd we don't think it's over but I also want to have this with my best with other articles on our Facebook page in recent weeks are um can the U.S equity market hit a war rate hikes\nDo you what do you wish your parents are taught you about saving for retirement\nWhat's your net worth petty compared to others and a a variety of I mean those kind of topics I think you'll find it interesting we also have one on your financial personality so we'll do every Wednesday we won't wear you out I think if you like to pay that you'll see a posting once a week\nAnd it's the Drake group that's like the the Drake group is our picture up\nEven though I look at looks shorter and with less serious than I Am in real life but anyway it said the Drake group that are vc\nOkay so\nThe last Seventy years stuck to the average actually lost Seventy two\nThere's stocks than average actually less Seventy two years of average eight point eight percent a year\nThat's when you own a stock hits a company in the real long term do I think that'll happen going forward I I have no idea actually be surprised if an average that much but looks looks at what's happened if somebody retired\nAt age sixty and their eighty five with a million dollars\nGolly if you put four hundred thousand of that million in socks if you've got eight percent for twenty five years it's worth two point seven million dollars and and like when I say that you're going oh yeah but who does that I see it all the time\nIt's dramatic the difference of four hundred thousand at eight percent for twenty five years is to point seven if you've got three and a half percent\nTo less than a million so\nThink about it when you own socks if you own I'm not recommending apple but every time they get a new product you make a little more money\nI'm not recommending McDonalds but every time I drive by one and somebody's whining about stocks being up or down I'm laughing because McDonalds is pretty good real estate and they charge for him and I'm sure it probably goes up every year\nAnd breakfast last what from six AM to eleven five hours and people who McDonald's ... get a piece here every Big Mac Diet Coke or I didn't see fewer people than McDonalds of after the election or the day before I mean\nSo if you do own business it is riskier but if you could own it for a long time you typically make more money so the person twenty five years ago that for four hundred thousand in stock that could could be over two and a half million bucks now\nIn the example I set out of a million if you put four hundred and stocks what do you do is six hundred you'd be fixed income it's your safety valve at your job OR Insight that your question\nBecause in stocks or do well and you're retired you need to be able to survive and do okay and do stuff for the grandkids and to her and do what you want to do so how do you figure out when you get in and when you get out\nAnd this sounds so simple that you're going to just go boy you're real knuckleheads Steve right [noise] okay a void extremes if I'm retired I Would not be all the stock market and it wouldn't be all out of\nThis applies to a Celts investments that are not in retirement accounts in your financial advisor should be able to give you advice on that about that new regulations coming in\nOn the fact of clean fuel the cruise ships need to use it's the same type of fuel that airlines use in the airlines are saying whoa or profits could be hurt because fuel prices go up\nThe refining business it's really interesting and it will soon much time on it but boy when times are good they make a lot of money when times are bad they don't make much money at all it's kind of a boom or bust feast or famine there are three types of fuel that are typically ... the refineries were the refinery heart of the country\nYou have basically gasoline that you put in your guest thank\nYou have a nice little jet fuel or civil or Chrysler recalled the just the woods and then you have the heavier fuels which might be a like in a ship so\nCruise ships will be competing now for the same as fuel that airlines use that fuel could go up I Want to talk about cruising for a moment\nI haven't taken many cruises but I have I don't know four or five is that many I don't think this many have enjoyed a tremendously\nThe thing about a cruise ship is if they leave the port in a cabin is empty they can never refill that cabin again\nSo sometimes there are a last minute deals on cruises I have clients who love the crews that are retired and they go on short notice I mean they might find out on a Wednesday that they can take your cruise boat from some other city they get a really inexpensive cruise so the vet doesn't go empty\nAnd they'll just zap off head off and take a cruise so financially some people enjoy your crews from the standpoint that\nAlmost everything paid for room and board is paid for meals or pay for their sub\nCrew flights will also pay for your airfare region has something to do that crystal has cruises strip the cruises which I really liked their Patrick like those too um they might pay for all your scourge gyms but\nThere's some financial freedom on a cruise boat that you're not making spending decisions every day where do we what does it cost what hotel to stay in how do we get from place to place\nI share this previously but I think it bears repeating\nI have a friend and attorney in three years his practice in bald suing cruise ships and that was a big part in practice\nDoing cruise ships and that was a big part of his practice\nIn if someone was accosted\nAre taking advantage of stolen from abuse and the past year on a cruise ship he would get involved\nIn I Know you represented one family where the husband was really drunk was drugs the wife was drugs in the person helped him back to the room and then a Acosta Dwight sexually abused watch\n'em now the ... how\nDo you worry on a cruise smoke shouldn't even say well here's what he told me\nHe goes and people are on a boat most people who work there very charming and their feel very comfortable with that right\nBut you've got employees from all over the world\nAnd did they really know all their backgrounds\nWell then what happens is if there's an employee so I did a cruise and we stopped in Croatia which was amazing amazing the little say you have an employee on the boat and they do something they steal they do something they shouldn't do\nWell in third grade so they dump 'em off the boat and Croatia\nSo like we had in\nA civil employees that we were like from the Soviet Union there was a girl or from Siberia or if you're on a cruise boat is probably flags in another country if you're told them from taking advantage of drugs right whatever and they dump\nHey Soviet Union employee often Croatia and the ships flagging Norway you try and get to the bottom of that it's just almost impossible\nHe just said it's really really difficult so\nI said do you feel unsafe for the cruise ship he goes no I don't feel unsafe he goes but when I'm In Houston I have a sense of awareness you know walk to my car at a at a grocery store I'm looking around I'm kind of watching her ... there is I don't go late at night and he goes in a cruise ship\nYou just need to really pay attention which I thought was a kind of interesting so when we moved to cruise we used a lady\nWho was amazing and she just cruise and she has a Yankee accent [noise] um [noise]\nBut like we booked a family crews and uh our whole family when in about a week before we left there were available nicer rooms and we all got up right and\nThey also have some other freebies we didn't know about our age it new and we got this\nAnd because she booked so many cruises with these cruise lines you could call the schedulers and say hey this is Gina I you know I have seven people were going to be working on this cruise you know what do we do you have anything nice group is not taken that we could bump 'em up to than they did\nSo it's really kind of interesting if I ever took a cruise again I'll probably take another cruise at some point I Will use someone who's a specialist keeps up with it and it does it all the time um the lady that I used who I've never met and I've had friends and family user and
