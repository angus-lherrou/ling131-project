his yard seeking him out he and his wife out saying we want to help you with the insurance company\nHe ended up not using an adjuster but he built his health better and nicer and more updated than when it then you know what it was before so really kind of interesting um\nAlso it was a I think it I think they thought some kind of surge protector bird that deal\nTrend maker had built the home in in in um\nIn that they helped him build it back they came and said look you know and it wasn't their fault that all turned banker was a great builder and then they came to him and said you know what we built the first time we're sorry you lost it really help you get it back it was really great experience but I mean there's great experiences you could be it\nIt it was a really great experience but

getting quite a sell off today headlined in the wall Street Journal\nA trio of wealthy Russians made an enemy of Newton\nAnd now they're all dead\nAnd these are people are like one of them was a one of the finance director for Russia's main airline\nHe's going to trial in London um and he said basically there are a lot of illegal things that the airline did I make good money off for the government there would be embarrassing to food and I'm and basically\nUh he ended up their whole group of people on my costs and then all in all the headlines now is the journalists to contribute in some things for the Washington Post um from Saudi Arabia he went into the Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey because he's getting married even certificate\nHe never came out alive his fiance waited outside in the car\nThey have all these security camera thing there's still no what happened but Fifteen people flew in and flew out from Saudi Arabia in and out of that or embassy that had\nQuestionable background he's gone so you know Russia does these things golly it looks like Saudi Arabians doing these things so it's just a great reminder to me\nYou know I really get tired of Houston traffic at times and things you know politically or things going on in this country I'm not always excited about some water and have excited about but boy what a great place to be compared to other places to live\nThis is a financial but I Do want to document it it is like two ... two thousand Eighteen\nToday in traffic I see a car that's going slow or the whole lane who left me going slow\nHigh go buy for cars in a row that people are looking or doing something on their cell phone and the car they were on their cell phone\nSo my reaction was a couple of things one this is record setting five cars that road cell phone activity\nTwenty six thousand one hundred and twenty [noise] my friend long term friends great guy my insurance ... joining us Hey Joe Hi good morning how are you\nGood morning Steve I'm doing great\nSo I was talking to someone this morning that has a home on the panhandle of Florida that this hurricane is raging down on 'em and it it kind of raise this question\nHow homeless totally destroyed him since most of us listening right now because we don't have homes in Florida I Want to use the example that ... that my house burned down will say my house burns them today ... how do walking\nWhat's the process what a bitch I mean first of all I got to go rent a place to buy insurance helped me with rental\nIt well yeah if you have a a loss a major loss of forces you out of your home\nOr it will pay for you to stay in an apartment a hotel or motel leasing other home of course that depends on how long the repairs take but it's really up to use to you know what other living arrangement you want to make but it will pay for the additional cost of that you expend to live somewhere else\nProject and then so if by my house burns down to the ground and I mean sure to build it back isn't probably going to be as nice as it was before burned down I Know it will be newer\nWell it should replace a and I guess part of what you're getting at is it is it going to replace which you've got right now\nYeah I'm there are any policy\nProperly written and I you know what underline properly written should have a dwelling limit that is sufficient to cover the replacement of that home as it stands there today\nI insurance companies all use pretty much all use of programs to determine what the minimum estimated replacement cost of that home is\nAnd you want to make sure that and you know talk to your age and whoever handles your insurance make sure you're adequately insured without dwelling coverage\nOr in a dish and you can have an endorsement or a writer that will you give you additional coverage on top of that base dwelling coverage for your home and a great example you're making you're talking about a fire well if you're home burns to the ground and it's just one home\nThere won't really be any impact on material and labor rights in the area for about a great example is a hurricane if we have a hurricane\nOr and we're obviously are prone to catastrophic damage from hurricane we could have thousands of homes a damn\nOh yeah right now it's busy and sorry I'll get lover and dry wall and all of it all goes\nUp and it can increase you know ten Fifteen twenty percent overnight\nAnd she goes I look at it and go okay do my kids want this so we're going to be happier if I said this so\nHer thought process and actually jotted this tale was look I'm not going to be here forever if it's really meaningful for me I'll keep it but if it's really not that meaningful I won't keep it\nBecause I won't be or some day and somebody else has got to deal with it so ...\nIs a ... he spent a lot more like a life stage so what do you do when you're young you accumulate hopefully you enjoy and you get to an age where you do accumulate is that a word on accumulate is that a word we get rid of things\nSo the fun part about my job is I see how much money people have how they spend it how they got it how they invest in a sense of them being happy\nAnd and like I Know intellectually and I know from seeing that when people have a more simple lifestyle they seem to be happier and they spend more time on the experiences in relationships\nBut it still doesn't always prevent me from wanting to get the newer nicer iPhone for one more item for you know get caught up in the material is is is driven by our society but if you
