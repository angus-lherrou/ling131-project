play out now in the country is is worse than um you expected and are we approaching perhaps\nThe Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nWere bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career and you have basically a nexus of or the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\n\nRadical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nGuys like and everybody knows this named George Soros what others as well with unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depends on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so you saw it in a cabin or hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know they're confined senators in elevators or where the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner do these aren't accidents\nAll right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they pro hold it\nThere in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this ah nuts are and the way he's addressed it has been held saw has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nAre just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have\nOrganizations that are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change Mm\nAll right and you've got twenty of them and they take their orders from big money to radical left people\nAll right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year by George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported lore you that\nMm no no no okay\nAnd so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening\nAnd you know I enjoy the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods are there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis\nAnd they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a theater thing than a than a but we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress rooms their cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros sort of a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was an accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and you get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nNo one and we're all in our online by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into that too actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm\nRight and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane and\nI you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and does this kind of country what\n... is is it\nYou're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been in plain out for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth\nOnly the apparatus is the criminal justice system now put forth\nHey radish is the criminal justice system put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter\nAs the senator from Hawaii say no matter who don't presumption of innocence or somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty\nBecause in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it they're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have un habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing and I think bill I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am ... I Am petrified of this I I I completely agree with you and I was slammed\nFor the last three weeks were saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put upon across crucified lose a promotion\nThis has got to stop that 'cause I got out but anybody well and it had happened it happened to me at ... obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and in one Syracuse or something where do you go to a radiation that way\n\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this capital mess my new column host Bill O'Reilly dot com is a is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how are your truth says replaced ...\nOkay so ... and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for 'em and and I I I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nI'm I'm I'm interested in the people behind her ... you know I first got flag to this when she her letter was leaked and immediately she hired the most radical left attorneys in the country\nAnd I said to myself if you are a victim of an assault is that where you go no\nFine line there\nSomebody's ... years of experience in this area that's where you go that was a huge red flag and of course the press ignored it\nLinder license to six three two one three [noise]\nAm settled on perjury\n\nNews this hour from town hall dot com ... in Washington [noise]\nAt least two people are dead and following the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's panhandle Michael was a category ... hurricane when it made landfall yesterday leaving behind a widespread destruction this morning video footage an aerial photos show catastrophic damage especially in Mexico beach\nWhere homes and buildings have been completely demolished on NBC's Today FEMA administrator Brock Long said people in the Carolinas which will feel the effect of now tropical storm Michael today need to be aware when eight people\nIn South Carolina North Carolina and to to remain vigilant and be careful if there's a strong tropical storm pushing through\nSpeaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last night President Trump offered his thoughts and prayers for those affected by the storm and he promised to spare no effort into federal response to damaged areas\nThis morning on Fox and friends the president said the U.S is working with turkey to learn more about the disappearance of journalist ... during a visit last week to the Saudi consulate in eastern bowl he said that he has to find out what happened before casting judgments on us Saudi relations\nTo astronauts from the U.S and Russia are safe this morning after an emergency landing in conflict than following the failure of a Russian booster rocket that was to carry them to the international space station a head of the holiday season America's retailers and shipping companies are looking for workers to stock the shelves and pack the orders\nTo help with the struggle many companies are taking steps they not try before like higher pay holding national hiring days impossible bonuses they're also providing more full time rather than part time work showing their Washington\nWall Street the Dow Jones down one hundred thirty seven points more on these stories at town hall dot\nCom guy I'm Scott from plugging pest free I Want to personally think all\nMy plug in Pittsburgh customers who have taken the time out to call right and who left messages to thank me for reading their homes and businesses although I'm wanted wrote in past problems so for me to you\nTheir homes and businesses of I'm wanted wrote it and cause problems so for me to you I think you plug in Paris phrase of the only scientifically tested and more importantly consumer proven electromagnetic pest management system since Nineteen Ninety five why put up with those annoying rodents and pass any longer\n... freeze one hundred percent chemical free making it your safe is bad too many ... problems around your family in ...\nWhen the sixty dollar money back guarantee you have nothing to lose so older yours today at go past free dot com use primary guide radio twenty to twenty percent off and free shipping that go\nPiss free dot com primary card radio corny spraying regret plug in and forget go past free dot com today\nThey're increasing pressure from Congress to ... to determine the fate of a journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in it's been ...\nMore than ...

are a lot of people still believe that Democrats are better managing government than the than the Republicans are\nSo but it's a Democratic Party was going direction but it's going in just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guarantee a the reelection of of Trump in two thousand twenty by making themselves so marginal so crazy so you know out there\nIn themselves so march also crazy so uh you know out there that they just are revolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\nFor the the chief law enforcement officer advocated violence\nAnd it's it's ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence or Hillary Clinton says\nYou can't be civil with people who want to destroy your your beliefs so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you hadn't\nNine Feinstein um claim\nThat her off it didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she did recover\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the let me giving in historical analogy if I may plays\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges caps as we're a plane or the radical up being funded by the KGB and she argued which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more ... more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominated George McGovern who was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon and Nineteen Seventy two\nSo so the Democrats swore that we're going to happen again so they they took control of the party and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won\nThe Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time defeating in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because of mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two you\nKnow I think through social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taking power this is part of the reason why\nThe leftist showing rage because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times is sad Joe CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lowering them show in the Fox news and to a ... well you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite they're recalling\nTheir marginal viewers Marshall readers merger listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more common class it\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear\nCalm and the storm don't you agree with that I\nWrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people he can't he can't really altered the change of what he can but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would've done he's got a chance to improve his standing\nAs as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... comic to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a this point in time\nSo go go go back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer hum so many great books how Reagan dealt with them the riots and will will play a bit of sound uh have you miss the show last night when\nThose people who do four days in advance that if the university's sought to go ahead with that construction they were going to physically destroyed in the university\nOf many of whom she ... she what is your universities in public institution that wouldn't be the universe its own community in the community where we live around\nThe end the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better ... young people think that they have the right to choose the law they obey as long as they were doing it in the name of social program\nHe gets up and he leaves yeah yeah that point I Do construction even talking about\nYou know there there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they want to do it a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam Vietnam Viet Cong soldiers satisfaction was completely\nOut of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb in the eyes establishment is what it was all about but what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson used to say that Ronald Reagan was\nHe said warmly ruthless and if you listen to regular says these professors somebody you're old enough an odd you know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I just I Love the fact\nThat he he he went right to the ... the salient point here crank which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior and then we're in big trouble if you ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of thumb up is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up ... tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a ... a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political or people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary [laughter]\nYeah like the ... one of the Tea Party and there but dressed in period ... yeah and that's\nWhere the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest they must be one of the same no they're not wanting the same motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's\nFeeling feeling is enough yeah as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you want to stand up for women in algae BT and then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nBut that may be upset at us before they're showing I beg your pardon my hat but the difference today between a moderate conservative leader Laurent serve a politician and a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician goes before the\nSort of a politician and a modern liberal politician is politician\nGoes before the voters says getting me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh gee I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because they because liberals going to do with a good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I make\nIt back to you Mm\nAfter think about it you have to go to the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended to be there in the first place\nWell I'd be again power ... tired of the people that try to show up that slogan but they never really know the that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nYep power to the people stays with them not some with some big nameless faceless bureaucracy a crank out and play one more thing fee then we're out of time not insist Jeane Kirkpatrick I think it was it the Nineteen eighty four Republican convention out Shiite Muslims yeah Harry from\nFainting source of our spring\nGod

financial topic was around\nA little bit to find my name is\nA simulated if you feel like\nYou're not prepared for retirement well then maybe you should have gotten a job in Oregon you know the public pensions are amazing but their promises that are made of need to be kept their just crazy expensive they probably won't be around forever\nSomeone who works in the public sector let's say for state or municipality typically like thirty percent less than they were making the proper workforce and one of the one of the reasons are willing to do that is they often get big tension\nThere is the eye surgeon who retired its head of the Oregon Health and Science University his pension in Seventy six thousand one hundred eleven dollars\nA month or you with me\nYou know what Seventy six thousand a month is\nYeah\nNine hundred thousand a year pinch and uh that's a lot more than the average organ family earns than a year in fact in Oregon there are two thousand people to get over one hundred thousand dollars a year\nLike bloody was the University of Oregon said football coach from Ninety five to two thousand eight\nIn his pension is based on just what he earned but also licensing and speaking fees his pension is forty six thousand dollars a month [noise] five hundred and fifty two thousand dollars a year\n[noise] so what happens many states and cities make incredible promises and they use bad assumptions have poor consultants and the key thing it's the politicians that authorized that their loved by the unions and the people who are going to pay but they're not around it to pay the piper\nAnd it would really be interesting uh think about ... to look at some of the cities and see if the ... that live there after they retire\nAnd then she could be here has kept me with my are still here sleepy brown still here I I don't know a lot for the tensions are credible pure white card in some places in California you're basically paid like a fireman and I'm not saying it's harder work or you're working you can retire with six figure pension\nAnd then here's the amazing thing and I talk to you mean it's for her recently\nAnd then here's the amazing thing and I talked to me that's for her recently\nThat sort of get eighty four thousand a year pension with a three percent cost of living increase which means in ten years to get a hundred and twelve thousand in Twenty years to get a hundred and fifty thousand on the pension so\nVenus values around the country and my goodness in California [noise]\nReally more of the Democratic states have the bigger pinch involves so Illinois a there are huge huge deficit is being run up and are these are obligations that means less firemen and policemen with other things that we are that we count on\nA I talked to a person who is in Houston city government [laughter] getting very nice pension and they said I'm moving out of the city because I don't want to have to worry about the taxes\nFake rather people's pensions so [noise] man Seventy six thousand or will the pension I think that's a record for the horror of fest Josephine Robertson retired surgeon of the Oregon Health and Science University that is their largest government pension that's got to be some kind of a record\nAre you happy or you unhappy there's a lot of studies that go on to try to crowd of people are happier not\nIn in what they figure it out is that if you move to a country where most people are happy you get happier if you move to a country where people are less happy you get less happy\nSo the good news is the rural happiness report has been published their break a hundred and fifty six countries might happiness levels they look at life expectancy social support corruption\nAnd if you like skiing ... in Santa Claus you won't be surprised to hear that Finland is the happiest place to live\nUp consistently when they do these\nThese surveys hits Europe's Nordic nations dominate the index so ... in Norway Denmark Iceland

skeptical\nThat's where I Can't talk why am I doing a radio talk show the ticker symbol came from the ... machine are still in use today\nOur country is going to be running big deficits in the next few years even though the economy assuming it is concerning\nBecause normally in bad times you take on death to keep things going and then you pay down debt in good times so we're taking on that in good times which means water bed times when it got even more\nHow do you fix it if we run a big deficit for it you know indefinitely will at some point you raised taxes so I thought it would be interesting to go back and say how high tax bracket used to be so you know now we're under forty percent of the very top or the high thirties\nIn the Nineteen thirties we were sixty three percent in Nineteen forty forty one forty to forty three were in the eighty plus percent range\nBecky forty four Nineteen forty five the top tax bracket was Ninety four percent through the seventies\nWere in the Seventy percent range I mean if you go from Nineteen Seventy one through Nineteen Seventy nine\nWhich was the seventies right the ... the top tax bracket was Seventy percent so you can always remember that top bracket was Seventy percent in the seventies Nineteen eighty one it was sixty nine percent it dropped a fifty percent in two thousand four thirty five\nI see maybe one in sixty nine percent of dropped a fifty percent in two thousand four thirty five percent [noise] 'cause there's always a feeling that if you pay money in taxes for every dollar you pay there's probably twenty five cents that goes away just administrative overhead\nAnd then the government redistribute the end it might not be efficient\nThe feeling is if you can hold onto your money you pay less in taxes you might buy a car you might have more yard work more landscaping I'm you know you might take a vacation and they could blow to a cruise ship to an airline I mean you're deciding where you are when he goes\nAnd obviously the government needs some money to make things work right we want to be secure as a country and they have opportunities and have a level of safety and oversight but if they get too much you get inefficient if he's not my ministry of overhead in the money doesn't flow through the economy in efficient way\nHistorically in our country politically we have swan left and right and typically come back to the middle and it's also happened in tax rates when I look at tax rates some from the Nineteen thirties through today\nWere way way at the lower end of the range running a big deficit and my predicting rate could go up well I'm not really going to make that prediction but I'll say this it wouldn't be unusual if they did at some point when Mike that happen\nMy goodness it seems like raped move back and forth every time we get a new ... you know a new president in er new political office in power a new political party in power so Republican superpower today rights have been reduced hit Democrats are in in power later on\nWhich is obviously a real possibility at some point that I Would expect that rates would go back up\nFor you personally it's good times I Hope they'll be like the government be smarter to go into debt sit down with\nYour spouse would go ... times are good we pay in the house all faster or we've been born a retirement plans are we getting paid for exactly what you should be doing\n[noise] how tragic as it does some people earn more money when they die you know Michael Jackson died in two thousand nine right when the stock market started to take off again he was having financial problems\nLast year as a state made a hundred and Fifteen million dollars how about Elvis Presley huh he died in Nineteen Seventy seven in August of artist that he was only forty two years old his estate last year may fifty five million how\nMuch they deserve more when I'm gone I'd like to maximize my earnings are right now\n[noise] hey Robert what can the KFC V. good morning either\nHey it's a ... as far as uh ensuring a teenager is concerned there's there's one question I had it if if I'm an adult and I have a car but since you know my brother comes over or somebody comes over and they drive my car aren't they insured\nUnder my insurance I Believe they are\nBut what does that apply if if my teenage son just got a license to do I need you know I'm sure you know the insurance companies are saying well he's got to be insured and that's always everybody's big problem is ensuring the teenagers but\nWhy is that any different with him driving my car and if somebody comes over my car and says hey let me use your car and go get a couple of feet says\nRight I Believe that um\nYour son will be driving it fairly often an insurance company wants to know it wouldn't be like an incidental\nThings and you know what you should do is you should um you should talk to your insurance agent about it well you know now they want to get someone to call in\nAnd talk about it\nYeah I I mean I Know I Need to call the insurance agent but I figured they would just do them you know the logical push you know you got to get to get covered that sort of\nThing you know there's some things they don't want you to know right I I think you're kind of looking for a short cut hey why get insured read it right [laughter] so here's the reality\nIs the risk of that car being wrecked in much higher because you have a young male driver\nEspecially in the city like Houston right and you need to disclose that\nYeah ... you're absolutely right he just got his life and then we just need a couple of months to get insurance show you know every once in a while we let him go get you know go get a pizza and and that sort of stuff and and\nWhy why are you waiting a couple of months where you ensuring him now\n[laughter] meal that you know that\nWe're we're we've got three kids we're paying for dance lessons in gymnastics and all that stuff I roamed the summertime that quit\nRight okay yeah\nI'm I think you'd have to talk to your church said just because you know what maybe your son directs the car and they'd say oh you have an unlicensed drop or maybe they cover you and then they\nCancel you yeah I Know he's license I\nKnow his license but if he's driving your car and you don't have insurance and you haven't told your insurance company I I'll Try to get the answer for you know I think the right thing is to not having them drive or talk to her insurance company and get him covered\nYou're you're absolutely correct we always we always do the right thing I just was in this little gray area here and I'm ...\nI'm kind of a you know I'm pretty black and white because ... that if you get gray a little bit ... gray the next time in the next time and the next time\nNeal slippery slope they call it\nExactly or I'll talk about that but uh I'll Try to get an agent on here we'll talk we'll visit about it okay\nI appreciate his teeth thank you\nOkay thanks bye-bye wow you know Exxon excuse me Enron and people who cheated a lot in my impression is they didn't walk in one day and decided to cheat seemed like such a\nLittle bit and then they post a little bit more in a little bit more in a little bit more\nAnd then they got carried away they had the courage to talk about the things they pledged on and\nYou know just the whole thing totally got out of hand so I think what you do is\nCall your insurance companies have the discussions and you know one of your voice a couple of months before they drop [noise]\nHow's the great physicist KFC money

telling me years ago you know you need to do just like to payments [laughter] uh you know every month and double up every month they'll get paid off a lot faster yeah oh yeah he he'd have that thing paid off in the early sixties\nWell your nine of them in the garden and same help sixty seven years is a rock star by my standards so when you brought up the advice he gave you about making good decisions are doing the right thing it's a it's certainly resonates\nOkay so if the guy still lifting who wanted to kind of cheat and be a little really a little dishonest and others closes Sunday the driver\nOf the nation either tell these kids if you can't drive the car or they should probably talk to the insurance company\nSo I wanted to add to lead you to be honest with them\nThey don't want to mention is the judge my insurance agent he's done a great job in your gets coach from different companies really shops that he keeps up with it um\nI always recommend them they will do Joe I'm going to give out your office there were a couple of minutes I appreciate your calling me on short notice like you so much\nIn fact well certainly my pleasure okay take care\nBye bye hello Betty what can

was laid off for some time uh and and ah and oil area and um we had to eat out for retirement for a little bit do we have\nWe have six and forty six for our kids and find clean I planned right and\nAnd then we have a million Eighteen we're going to be able to retire [laughter]\nI think so here's here's what you do first of all I'm for your kids at thirty six thousand and forty thousand\nYeah that probably won't pay for four years of school\nRight but you got time just save more high end any minor lighter than\nGive me more and on top of that or like if you could afford to add some along the way it would be a nice thing okay but what you have done you pay for at least two years right\nSo I Hope I Hope so too I mean I've seen people that I've seen the family is safe for two years got one year funded and maybe the kid borrowed one year old\nYou are in the ballpark\nWhat you do also if you take\nThe million dollars of savings today\nIn over the next you know if your husband retires in sixty five and Thirteen Years if it grew at six percent a year it's going to be over to point one million\nWell he wants to retire earlier than that and and we are we do have a an ad or something that route one way or with a hundred by a company on or whatever one of the bigger ones um I I guess what I'm Wondering is [noise]\nI ... and the guy had on the half the older man that we're talking about yeah you know we've got one point that we have no other jak and\nOn the train because we can kind of trying to think that we have a two point five interest rates and and it seems to me that our money matters and may I don't know why [noise] first than\nOr how close are they asking pain and and go that route versus what would you agree\nNecessarily yeah and here's why I Know I Know because you're ... you're on a two point six you're making more\nFirst of all I didn't like\nOkay you didn't make more the first quarter of this year\nBecause the laws are both down okay\nIn sometimes investments to go down\nIn here was ... years old my plan would be\nI Would get it paid off by the time he retired\nI because there's\nThere are times if you owe money on a home in investments don't do well it instills trust\nYeah there's also psychological value in having a house paid for\nThe like let's just say let's say if I owed money in my home at two point six percent and I thought it would make five\nMaybe I'll make five six or seven but if the market as a twenty percent correction when she does every three years I'm going to feel stressed\nAnd then the other thing is for an extra one two or three percent\nAnd they have any level of threats are outstanding debt\nI'd rather have that taking care of\nSo if your husband and fifty two said I Want to retire at sixty I Would play into painted off over the next eight years\nYou don't say anything can happen to work out and bought and yeah I mean there but I Would rather go that route they make more in ten years\nRight in the end if you're OK with that\nMathematically intellectually it makes sense\nIntellectually it makes sense\nI Want everything paid for when I retire [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nOkay now I don't think\nIt depends on what you're spending is so what you focus on now\nStill maximize here's what I'd be thinking about\nWhat I Want to get off I Would get my house paid off in eight years I'd say as much as I can along the way police on your retirement plan investor I have appropriately\nAnd then I Would literally sit out on the porch at night and pour a glass of wine and think about\nHow simple can we live and be happy\nBecause I see you don't like like classic example\nI Know a couple of the hill country\nIn one of these beautiful charming German jail\nThey live in a twelve or Thirteen hundred square foot home with a big\nPorch in a Tin Roof of the garden mhm and when you walk in there's no stuff yeah right I mean it's nice\nBut they do them stuff stuffed up to know them they keep it really simple mhm they volunteer at the museum\nSquare dance they walked down three mornings a week have coffee and a big old German like a muffin with\nTheir friends their active there in the garden\nThey travel on short notice some discounts and they don't spend much money\nAnd a lot of money you don't have as much as you have so\nThey both are rich because of it than what they do and they're just not cut up in a I don't know someone that has\nTen times as much money and so\nA second home in a class car\nMotorcycles\nAnd in all these hobbies\nAnd they're just frantic all the time\nYeah not not worth it\nThat's just not worth it I mean you go to do wild stuff the stuff on me\nSo you guys have been pretty good savers and have a million bucks that money set aside for your kids are getting your house played them\nFigure out how simple can I get to be happy I was recently at someone's home\nIn a small town\nThey paid eighty thousand for it and they\nRemodeled and spent forty so there are a hundred and twenty thousand of six acres\n[noise] they have a pond\nIn big porch\nIt's not a big house but it's got to open kitchen living dining\nEver really cool born and the guy goes out in the barn and does some woodworking and some different things and when you drive by this house you just never think one thing about it\nNothing is remarkable about it's a drive by\nBut inside this house\nActive in their church\nThey have family over all the time\nOf the figured it out yeah\nAnd it didn't make a lot of money so you need to focus on that in addition to fully saving\nAnd the other things we just talked about\nPrimary property [laughter]\nYeah well there's no state income tax bill playing for property taxes I okay I\nHave a great day care okay\nI've seen ... KFC money matters [noise]\nDr seuss\nBeard or his last name as GE IFC L [noise]\nHe died in Nineteen Ninety One seven years old [noise] ledgers they wait for five billion dollars [noise]\nHey I'm going to go back and talk about the interviewing figure just moments [noise] appreciate you joining me I'm your Monday through Thursday a little bit of twelve is is say as TV [noise]\n\nYour home team for conservative talk radio cancer you leave several hundred am no voice from Texas\nOr many years the pine box has been helping families gain insight into the often confusing and extremely expensive task arranging all at once funeral", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "11"}
