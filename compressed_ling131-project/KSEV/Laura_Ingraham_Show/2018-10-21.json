Y. N. and\nAt L. U. I. N. C. dot com ask Glenn at L. U. I. N. C. dot com\nWe were talking about a concept called disparate impact when we went to the last break and that has affected landlord tenant selection criteria although you should no longer use a blanket criteria rejecting anyone with a criminal background\nOr you can lift some specific criteria that are important for the operation of your property so the idea here is is that replacing this blanket\nTenet criteria that says if you have a criminal background you may not read that property you are going to have specific reasons why you are choosing to eliminate people with certain\nCriminal convictions and we're talking about convictions here and someone who's been arrested that has not been convicted that it's not something that you can consider a that's a very important part of the disparate impact conversation\nThat's a very important part of the disparate\nImpact conversation\nSo we're talking about convictions here\nAnd the ones that I Believe you should and can still put in your tenant selection criteria especially because here here in Texas we are renting properties typically there are three two two which means three bedroom two bath two car garage is maybe four bedrooms\nAnd they're they're in neighborhoods and\nWe have families living you know next door to our rental properties and we want to make sure that we are a good\nNeighbor a good citizen as a landlord so that our neighbors have a great relationship as well will tell us what's going on on the property will tell their friends and family about our property and be willing to help us get it rent it when it it it turns over so\nI think some reasonable criteria are violent crimes against other people I think a criminal conviction for violent crime against other people it's something that you can and should list in your Kennett criteria is something that you will not have in your property\nCrimes against children especially if your property is listed in your school showed sex offenders are are something that you know that as a crime that if they if they convicted of that crime you need to consider putting that in your tenants selection criteria what might be some other things that affect you at the landlord\nI'm a destroying property might be one if they'd been convicted for a starting fires if they'd been convicted for tearing up another landlords property and they've been convicted for a vandalism those are the types of things that you might be looking for\nIn your ... selection criteria to make sure that the person you put in your property has a high probability of successfully being able to follow the lease and comply with it\nWhen you're putting together your Kennan selection criteria that you also want to consider the number of people per room\nAnd the number of vehicles and depending on your property if it's in an H away if there's other requirements you might have a a for instance I have a a had a rental that was a Nineteen sixties property with very small bedrooms\nTwo children would be the maximum in any of those rooms and so that set the maximum for the household a I have had properties with H away rules that do not allow a\nCars to be parked on the street so all of the family vehicles have to sit in the garage\nOr in the driveway so if someone has more vehicles than than will fit\nThan this isn't going to be a good rental for them because they're not going to be able to stay in compliance with the H away\nA ... do not allow ... trucks to the park out in front of the property so these are the types of things to have in your tenet selection criteria that last tip I Want to tell you about tennis lecture criteria is that if you're asking for Social Security number you need to have a privacy policy as well that you give them at the same time\nIf they're logging into a service you're going to use that service\nWill have the privacy policy right there with it and this is Len Merlin the lifestyles

review [noise]\nWe're back with the lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show this is Len Maryland today we're working on your financial freedom with three helpful for tennis screening we've covered the first test create your own kind of selection criteria don't use standard\nForms out there without highly customizing them to make sure that all of your requirements\nFor potential tenants are in your tennis selection criteria that we briefly mentioned mentioned the fact that if you're going to be asking for Social Security numbers which you need to do for tip number three that were going to cover in just a minute\nA you need to have a privacy policy as well if you're using an online service then they will probably be providing that privacy policy that you need to check and make sure\nThen our second tip that we were talking about just before the break it's about your rental application it should give you the information you need it should be ... you need to complete for your perspective tenants\nAnd you need the completed application from everyone Eighteen years and older who live in the home you need to know who the other residents who are under Eighteen will be their full names and birthdays and you have\nTo have that information about every place that they live and where they're working so that you can verify both their their previous addresses and their employment and it's really important to do this so when they say that they lived at ABC apartment building in San Antonio\nYou want to make sure that you go out and Google ABC apartment building in San Antonio and you pick up the contact information off of the Internet rather than relying just on the information provided in the application and it's the same with verifying their job\nUh unfortunately people run all kinds of scams a against landlords being able to rent a property is critical for people like they need a roof over their head whether it's a single family home or living in an apartment community\nAnd if they have done things that make it difficult for them to do that there is a temptation for them to do things like um [noise]\nGet to one of their good friends and use their phone number\nAnd tell them who the name of the person that someone will be asking for and having them provide the reference having them provide the information on how long are the prospective candidates been employed and what they make\nAnd you don't wanna fall prey to that so it is important that either you or whatever company or realtor you're hiring to screen you're kind of goes out and verifies independently the contact information for previous landlords and places that they've lived\nAnd their current employer\nBecause it you have to get good information so when you're going out you're going to go as far back as you can on the uh the landlords and most people are not going to tell you a whole lot that they probably will tell you if they've had to evacuate\nThis perspective tenet or if they have had other issues with them like um you know a lot of police calls out to the property and things like that those are things that are truthful\nThat they can say about the tenant without getting into any legal issues and the landlords desire to help other landlords at the same time they'll also tell you this has been an amazing tenant\nAnd they will tell you if they have gone over the top ... I've had several landlords telling me that the tenant has left the property in better condition than it was in when they moved in\nMaybe they went and added some nice landscaping or you know just really took care it cleaned up the property when maybe the landlord didn't do what we teach lifestyles and they didn't turn the property over an excellent condition\nSo those are that's the the positive side of this point\nWith employment employers are going to limit what their information they're going to give you to um the higher date\nThe current status of the employee and the employees pay rate and they're probably going to require that you provide the prospective tenants\nSignature authorizing them to release that information so they may ask you to a email over scan over or sometimes facts over a debt permission which should be given with in the application itself\nIf it is and then you'll need separate form that is that they sign that gives you the permission to get\nYou don't need a separate form that is that they sign that gives you the permission to get this information from their employer and yeah we always ask you know their prospects of continued employment but you really that's hard for an employer to do and you'll get a a variety of answer there so that\nUp our second tip and that is making sure you're rental application is easy for them to fill out an easy for them to access and you get all the information that you need [noise]\nAnd just a few moments we're going to be back and we're going to talk about the third cat for tenants screening and this is an important one this has to do with that credit and criminal ... so stay right here you don't want to miss out you're listening to the lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show this Islam or [noise]\n\nYou know you're out there in hiding in plain sight living on my wife desperation wondering you're going to be your money can be great if there's a better way of federal white boys style home when you find the liberal white deserve the only do that by creating half the income\nWhat do you um do our work than another meeting about meetings or none of my my one of the TV\nWise you know that's why I'm\nWelcome to Jimmy Johnson side you bring some so good how do you make the highest quality ingredients in love I mean we\nReally don't sing along with my one of his baby Muslim either my parents seem to be me right and we don't do the baby carrier to carry the Warm Springs nine green we some of the whole Iraq I mean they're not babies sandwiches\nOkay I'll stick to turkey Tom name on it makes it hard number\nDry our new nine green weed subdued you be jobs we bring yeah ... county judges accounting learn\nFrom running the ... election for building roads building community learn more about how your county helps you in fact the county delivered auto workers sponsored by the Texas Association of Johnny\nMellow I Am chemicals partner Hi I'm Marie excellent ... and we're here to tell you about what our granddaughter's mining how many yes that does\nNot fourth generation historical Houston business the splits burger family has been creative beautiful monuments and cast a memorial in Nineteen twenty two\nWe work in all cemeteries onsite servicing an sample I think we also have a unique variety of garden are sculptures address blacks and garden sounds onsite more let us help you create your own custom designed to members of monument there'd more Americans that are monument ... any American Institute of commemorative art\nHave your trees running for hurricane season today with ability treat experts ability trees Houston's leading tree care professional\nWe're sort of time or boys so we're all used\nBoys [noise]\nAll that\nSoon as he will or to the landmark\nArms control agreement because Russia is borrowing my parents and but the bill is preventing us from developing modern weapons systems where you might be feminine agreement robots for us and Russia for ... for producing or just buying underground launch cruise missile range for three hundred and thirty four hundred miles\nPer se or ... years very talking to Robert Gratz production boom what are you\nHow do they want an election do we really have an election\nThey want to check on what your Second Amendment I Want to raise your taxes or want to open your borders let people and\nThey're legally and then they want to pay for those pretty fall for health care for education\nBeing alone with the terms just around the corner of Russia who is this person us accusations are burglar\nRussia's deputy foreign minister says Washington having spread shameless blogs about the mythical hand to Moscow for more than two years is now trying to claim to fame ...

more money I'm going to have been a few people get a few a few raises\nThe economy is so boring and as it goes the Democrats become more and more unhinged I Want to go back to the players in the first hour we're going to play it again I Want you to hear the tools songs a little fun this is our friday edition and may goes wrong tomorrow from forty six well we got a new Hillary song Korea\nHillary Clinton apparently the federal judge says the state department nobody clearly false statements to derail requests for Clinton documentation regarding Benghazi is so much so that it shocked in dumbfounded the judge\nSaid sure uh Cheryl Mills she got immunity\nYou got the or the need the judge learn from the ... board that she'd been given immunity and that uh they're they're notations were

me the song and thank you for sending it I I just there's a video if you want to go watch it on YouTube are like at this point what difference does it make\nWell made a difference between a corrupt administration and I'm sure Brock Obama was completely unaware\nYou want to see the difference in leadership looking Donald Trump is going on now all they get mad because he called the stormy horse race and I know they didn't get mad when stormy talked about his penis and all these other things for the last I don't know a few months the things they said about president no they don't get mad at me that he deserves it but ...\nWhen it comes to the president responding well then he's a horrible monster you know what he can color or race only watch\nIf he's going to continue to announce things like cutting five percent from the each member of his cabinet in agency budget\nIs that they're going to ask every secretary cut five percent next year he spoke to his cabinet members during the White House meeting on Wednesday afternoon and said that some agencies may cut more than five percent you get rid of the fat get rid of the waste\nThe federal deficit jumped Seventeen percent in the last fiscal year that seven hundred and Seventy nine million dollars and the president defended recent traumatic spinning in order to restore military funding admitting that he had to give Democrats waste of money to give them on board\nWe had to do that in order to get the votes because we don't have enough Republican votes without them into the military funding would probably be around seven hundred billion and the next budget instead of the earlier price tag of seven hundred and sixteen million\nIt's dark there's nowhere close to being as it as much as we'd like to start\nDoing some things\nI Would love to see what he does over the next year regarding some of this but what happens in the other thing is talking about that I Know Rick Freeman with your money will talk about this more but they would get unemployment claims dropping again unexpectedly to two hundred and ten thousand that's pretty amazing\nThe economy is soaring and the Democrats keep telling his wages are stagnant they are not rising there are more people working your wages rise when you go from not working to getting paid for a job right\nAnd that are technically raise when you go from ... in ... and that's a bit of range rights no they don't count that that doesn't count okay well what about people that have gotten raises what about the tax cut her address a said oh this morning\nA charge and he was debating with a liberal I Can't remember the guy's name but he was trying to explain to him how are the the deficit spending that's the problem tax cuts do not\nTouch go call just to get less money no we cut taxes and into the last fiscal year the Irish brought in more money than it ever has in the history of this country\nBut I thought tax cuts are moving what does that mean and we didn't cut taxes than it would have been twice as much or three ... no that's not how it works what happens is we have more people working so guess what even though the payroll lower percentage\nTo pay more taxes what a concept huh you mean of everybody's working we get more revenue coming in\nAnd then the rich [noise] I Know it's a foreign concept to Democrats they don't understand that [noise] they don't care or

recently or the parents named him walk your paypal host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states [noise]\nYes and actually for the sixth year in a row and that again it's all because of our clients so thank you guy I Hope those if you listen to show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about\nSomething that I think is a very important it is very important to us but I'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen\nOf how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen is that um you know I think that you're financially you'll be successful but I also think you'll be successful in life\nAnd so the same kind of things that it takes to have a successful business to a successful financial advisory firm I think are the same sort of things that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm going to apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this segment on ... you are the most important person in the entire world so as I mentioned in the previous segment I we we not work with the uh eight thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you got grandparents children grandchildren\nAnd in some cases great grandchildren it really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do in your\nHow can we keep money matters and during\nA it wouldn't be irresponsible of of us you know with regards to our clients and and their families so we we have we called vision one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong are stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are where we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brings it doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do with your values so in your family it it would need the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera\nThis is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life\nAnd if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera so this segment is you are\nThe most important person in the world so we have to core values that applies that number two number for its core value number two says that our clients benefits before we do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless if everything you do is geared around helping others\nThat what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works it's this magic that happens it's sometimes called karma sometimes it's called the golden rule\nIt it's there's it's what reaping and sewing I mean the religions talk about it all the time and if you focus entirely on that if anything those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had is because that's our philosophy that's how we live\nSo that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meetings that we have with our senior financial ah partners or our senior partners where we talk about strategy we talk about or you know what we're going to do with given market conditions and all those kinds of things\nAnd in that meeting we had a chair it's an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we'd say is we want to all with imagined that a client is sitting in that room with us while we're having this meeting\nAnd we always used that as our listeners to that client sitting in that room with that's with day approve of what we're saying in this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we ... we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo they're kind of go to you know behavior that somebody's watching you all the time behaved as if what you're doing is is it's impacting others because when you start looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming in ... you close up and you close up opening to all the opportunities that are out there for your\nCore value number four says if a client calls us we lost and what I mean by that is is that\nIf people rely on you ... you know you have to think of yourself as their servant you know we feel like we work for everybody you know I'm the c._e._o. of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works at our firm\nI'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job the best that they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we have a client called us we lost but I mean by that is that if a client called us about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or if there's something going on the markets or anything that a client would call it's about\nWe should be a head of that we should be pro active leak communicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call it so therefore a client cause us we lost now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right and they moved\nOr you know there's a change in their life or something happened those situations obviously it's a client called us we didn't lose but anything that we should have told them first we did lose so in your life I think about people and uh how you run your business or if you're a if you work you know your boss your the people that a report up to you your peers\nKeep them informed about what's going on don't ever let somebody call you and say hey what's going on with that\nWhen you told them you were on top of it keep them informed at all times and you'll give them peace of mind don't trust you and you'll be ... and I think you'll be happier in the process as well without here no doubt\nOkay now we are a financial advisory firm or not a a philosophical firmly do apply but we were when we preach uh and uh we uh would like to work with you if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon so that this you then that's\nThat'd be specialized\nIn working with so if you have questions about your pension plans you take a pension or a lump sum if

professional help you to make those decisions if you're about to get Social Security or you want to make a ... and take it the right way you want to get income from your investments all those kinds of

our noble obligation that we all have and I'll tell you what that is when we come back that says money matters and I am ...\nVolatility in the market you may be asking yourself how will this affect my retirement savings will I Need to\nPostpone retiring is there anything I can do to avoid the bear market if these questions are on your mind it's time to get some answers letters show you how to protect and maximize your retirement savings learn how the by old themselves strategy can help you minimizing bear market declines and find out how money matters can help give you financial\nThe same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial adviser for him in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our ally but in most valued clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial budget from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're\nDoing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility it is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory firm die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common if they had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are mad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is of values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or the or or the or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that ... over the course of time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you would you Bill we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also fell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money ... you can invest and I think a bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down if you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last\nThen you could be down you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually salad that's when you realize the value that you've created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is of value so therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAren't we have ten core values and I want to share with you core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because the risk is not your friend\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend\nOkay people who take high risk you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they had the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan so when we tell us what we tell people in fact we say that that are seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible\nThen here's what I recommend sell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turned it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcase full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red okay we're big bat\nNow if we hit or going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returns Vegas awaits\nBut somewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas and betting it all on red lights how much has been\nAnd our little philosophically in life and I think your goals in life should be the same thing is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your goals\n\nYou [laughter] well I Love you that because if you take\nYou [laughter] well I Love you that because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with ah Michael Douglas we said greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way of spanking greedy people bottoms bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a ... you don't want that that's not a pretty sight okay you don't want bright red cheeks so take only as much risk in your life and your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish hurdle otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent and the risks that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk as it's necessary to accomplish hurdles\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I might tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors um or you'd like to go
