the guy was hot like by the guy\nIt was his hat off and they feel like super\n... favorite superhero and your mid\nMe so [noise] Donald Trump or as someone who\nDefied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transfer Jeb Bush they said that uh do Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do\nWe played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we now he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think there there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's tie in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care I\nI wanted a male role model to follow\nAnd someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just a personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a fan of president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut do you notice that John Lehman et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance economy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West so close to\nGetting a lot of other have someone to help them have been guide him and he needs a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo

educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts and George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people who voted their lives for this oil\nI mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room Katy\nPerry running around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay\nPeople wouldn't know a domestic policy if a bit I'm In the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up

is interesting of course\n\n\nThis is Michael ... here with Mike stone from health mark and helping folks find the right Medicare coverage this news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of\nMany Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access to thousands on Medicare plant plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plans that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind so many new option it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may conflicts and cover more with lower co pay more choice of like dental vision a prescription drug coverage and the freedom to see the doctors and you\nDon't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nYou know at some point it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration\nIs the more Congress unite sued the president on issues such as this statement actually in the United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better Americans doing they are they are more and more angry\nWell as you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency\nI'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is a driving them I think to a\nA two to this is talk on attractive or to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThe interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenger the other day said or about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's\nListen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have when the Supreme Court justices\nWho believes in voting rights ... believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can\nHe fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only mean confirms if it were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that what they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly\nHe's not running for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with a with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats in the heart left\nOr who were who were uh we're seeing a crew the is the sort of a mob rule\nAnd senator what is your that cake right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how things really look we'll start with the crude said\nWell I think Ted's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows it nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nMid term elections we usually see a down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings of energized or our base and um we've seen people like governor president didn't and Tennessee said while he would have voted for a cap and all but I'm the truth is\nIf you worked a Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a sharp turn the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't pick up the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and that kind of ... for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to\nDiscussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court tech the incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circuits we saw\nFor cabinet and namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI\nReport or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then a leaked that sent it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm most cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve for Dr Ford's interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this or are they ... they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this 'cause this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\nNames we ... we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a\nCollaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republican and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation that's fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really traits what happened who did it and someone's lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what the jurisdiction of federal jurisdiction whether a federal crime was committed here a lot and I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn a hearing alerting them shows senator or for the next to you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it than\nI don't know since when I mean it's just it seems like all hands around ... people are working together they're not\nBiting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nIt's not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't heard Nikki Haley think she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time for the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think\nThat it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or\nOr capital or some of the other Democrats all about ... gel McCaskill exactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents than the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that uh the the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other\nCelebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know for this president and I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was at that reading poetry so and no one ever like that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has is that I was in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn\nTruck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of hold up the merit of the Democrats does he not\nI I think so well it's just drive it makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or rush irrational ways and\nAnd uh we've seen that looked in the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I take this or we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including a adding more federal judges to the bench\nOh my gosh that is ... and the judicial branch coal equal ranch of our government article
