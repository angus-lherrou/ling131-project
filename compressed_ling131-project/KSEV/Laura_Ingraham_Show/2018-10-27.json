seven those two factors are signals all a lot less optimistic expectations of growth and expectations of a a\nImprovements in in global economic uh scenarios than what a many of a of of of the investor base and obviously of investment bankers anything since we're expecting at the beginning of the year I think that both factors\nUm are sort of a starting to show the people that\nAre economic

with Daniel kind of right now have rolled up antibodies dot com on our ... output will find there on our ah our cat sat and are available for you for immediately download it after the interview a Daniel so we're talking a little bit here about about kind of\nWhich brings us back to that question right is it so this is really a ... you know everybody's worried about the stock market butler really honestly people are really interested in what's happening with interest rates because\nYou know all the stock market effects may be the top ten or twenty percent of the people would actually better than the interest rates affect everybody from housing to credit cards to mortgages were watching housing cells really declined here in the U.S auto sales declined sharply\nYou know things that are interest rate sensitive really coming apart the belief from a lot of the mainstream media interest rates are on their way to the moon we're going to be a four and five percent interest rates [noise]\nMy my theory and in my belief is that you can't have five percent interest rates in an economy that slated to grow at two two and a half percent we've had a\nWe've had a bump in economic growth the first half of this year because of three major hurricanes last year or two major wildfires lots of fiscal stimulus being put in a expansion of the national a deficit to almost a trillion dollars now\nBut those are all very one time temporary effects that are going to be fading off the economy's going to slow down and I don't see how you maintain three three and a half percent interest rates in that environment your thoughts\nOf it is very typical I agree with you what I Do think however and this is what are the grants from the the views of some people in in in the market is that the reason why this expansion is surprising in terms of a shame it goes\nWell you very well and then she had numerous times fake expression riding again I always say that every time I go to the United states say look there's a hundred and fifty million people here that I haven't seen the recovery\nOkay so and at that is the reason why it is surprising or unexpected Judy being driven ... that it's a very macro\nIs a very sort of big data driven a recovery that has not seen the majority of people and they are disposable income in their batteries in their day to day lives there for the question here is\nA first our interest rates go rattles no they won't let me start early on I think that the the thirty year bond is telling you that the boardwalk and tell me a lot of things that they use you know they won't know what I Want to make is that the the the growth potential of all of the economy the u._s.\nNo it won't because they're the the the growth potential of all of the economy the U.S as well have been eroded dramatically every time that we have access to the edge of the crisis\nSo the U.S is not an economy that it's going to grow at a sustainable for fire intense therefore interest rates are not going to be the those levels\nAnd so we need to start from that premise federal agents that we understand that that premise means secular stagnation cats on the point about about whether the U.S can enter into recession depends very much on whether the fed and uh falls into its own crap\nYou know it's the fed seeing these market decides to invade interest rate hikes it will not sold\nThe the bottle of the market and it will definitely not feeling it back again but more importantly in will lose precious time to build some tools for the change of the cycle so it's a it's a catch twenty two situation if you if you do any of them again and yelling and\nDecided to take action because the markets are jets or and or what you do is delayed the process you will have a much bigger problem\nIn the near future when the cycle return for those hundred and fifty million there and started and starting to see a little bit of a real way to grow enough much anyway so the point is\nIs the United states better ... better prepared for a change of economic cycle than the rest of the global economy is a game of relatives\nYesterday let's let's let's be very very clear about this all of the all of the fact that you mentioned are absolutely clear but when you look at them compare to wear a merger markets are where you are a place where Japan is it's not even a comparison\nAnd but if the U.S goes back to\nA ... being extremely aggressive death for very accomplished very very devilish about its monetary policy\nPrecisely in that period in which those hundred and fifty million people are able to start to see some real disposable income improving see the purchasing power of their salaries improve et cetera then that is when it's going to get really nasty so the point that I'm trying to make is that\nFirst no we're not going to the interest rates going in to those levels because of the potential grow the economy because of the leverage of the economy itself and the leverage of the government\nBut more importantly because the productivity growth\nIs extremely poor and that in itself which is sort of a kind of a process of overflowed stagnation if it's ... cents\nOr makes perfect sense and and but I Do have to correct you on one thing because you know Janet Yellen herself said that we would not see another crisis in her lifetime\nWhat\nShe'd like nine hundred years old so they may not matter\n[laughter] well\nYou see this is the problem of central banker incentive you say to enter bankers\nAnd what they do is that they see what we see every day when we talk about every day which is which are bubbles or excessive valuations and markets as a small collateral damage\nFor the greater good which in GDP Growth and employment they don't see the ripple effects that create in the economy again and obviously because they\nThey don't follow market they simply well obviously everybody gets excited all seems to get excited when Martin let's go up but they don't see the negatives of something that like what we are seeing right now\nAnd why because they make their spreadsheets calculations I've worked with many people that worked in the shed and they'd say oh there's plenty of liquidity that will jump in the market\nWhen the the correction I guess what it doesn't happen you just a whole set of sweets I think it was a few hours ago what'd you showed the health liquid evaporates so dramatically in so quickly\nAnd central bankers don't understand that because they had a completely or\nLet's say outdated gauge all what bar in its value grits cannot\nAbsolutely right [noise] um but just brings back into the ... come back to interest rates for just a moment what drives interest rate ultimately are and and I'm now specifically talking about the ten year treasury um yeah I I think there's a huge problem coming for corporate bonds I think there was a huge problem comes renewable bonds\nUm what you're talking about the pension fund problem as well the the currently exist in the U.S [noise] but specifically when it comes to treasuries interest rates are currently are pulling back a little bit today we saw money coming out of you know out of the risk of equities looking for a place of safety [noise] um\nThe the in the next crisis I'm much like we saw drink two thousand a\nMoney gravitated towards the ten year treasury in particular as safety liquidity and of course if you're anywhere in the world\nUm despite what you think about the u._s. it's still one of the economy to hide reserves and I'm In the middle of a a a crisis I'm not sure I Want my money sitting in Zimbabwe or Russia or China right I Want my money where I Know I can get access to it [noise]\nUm do you think that'll will see that same type of event\nIf we see another recession\nI I think it will be very similar to address as we mentioned before the the market is a game of reading and we we analyze all the all the challenges and all the battle of the U.S economy but we tend to forget financial the financial batter smell and the financial batteries are important\nA I don't but what is very likely we will have a a European style post you eat the Coleman to you if you look at the shark Europe though see any case is that when\nThe entire market is thinking hey Draghi or the other is going to bail out it's simply just fades down a courtroom slowly slowly slowly slowly in the U.S the different there's been buybacks we have to see what will happen\nYeah and I think I'm almost a would be better off with just a crash get behind us do what do you want to bring\nHim in foreign I I'm not sure the death by a thousand cuts of the European style market for the night or even Japan I remember going back to Japan and post Nineteen Ninety Thirty years of stagnation in the market economy I'm not sure I Want that for my kids\nYou are you and I agree I think that so many people are very very bright people follow markets that understand the economy agree central bankers don't know and the reason why they do things because the entire monetary policy instead to avoid the pain\nThe the main sometimes or the trendy thing\nIs a very positive a very positive thing that will allow productive sectors just thrive and the you just got back to be taken out and batteries to improve productivity to improve but I have in the comments and and as a scholar I get so worried when I talked with with\nColleagues that state well one of the problem with Japan Japan had their\nBelieve me at ... you don't have that over the top ... lists are so many people say Japan has very low unemployment Japan has a decent uh ... uh salaries\nAnd Japan has very high did one of the problem as a nation well that is a problem for maybe some other people but you know in that sense\nThere is sort of a comfort zone in the lead the world moving in fat nation because at least you will not seen\nFrom the painful process of Clinton and that I'm afraid is going to continue to be the driver because\nThey're not there is a political angle as well central bankers and\nA large international bodies believe that the reason why populism is rising in the world ends because all\nThe financial crisis and the way in which countries responding financial crimes that they should've been done with more public spending with the mall entitlements with more companies still completely wrong ... from\nDidn't have any austerity whatsoever and full of its parliament in\nAnti globalization and I'm tired a guy you know the status quo so\nBasically that would probably be avoided the pain at all costs a A N and not do that that person may the end is actually a a a creative destruction process that wouldn't be very positive for productivity real wages and disposable income on the middle class\n... will read them populism is rising because Seventy eighty percent of Americans have one in five hundred dollars in the bank forty percent of millennials wasn't home on a couch\nThey can't get a job if they do get a job which hey we're right now Daniel we have a three point seven percent unemployment obviously everybody's got a job or if that's the case then why do we have one out of four households on some form of government subsidy\nLabor force participation rate philosophical from Nineteen seventies I mean you can just go right through the numbers than headlines look great\nUm you know it it's great but if you're working three part time job driving a new borough and this is a true story I was in Florida\nThe guy that pick me up his whole job was he drove a new breed drove a weapon you deliver packages for FedEx so that was how he made his living running three part time jobs twelve hours a day that is a reality for a lot of Americans in this country and that's all we really are seeing the wage growth that\nOf course yeah but that is the reason that is why that is why Donald Trump chemicals in the elections and say the job market isn't the worst shape ever\nAnd all those concerns says all over the mainstream conservatives who say what the hell you're talking about it it was four and a half percent or ... people died you know back to the point of a hundred and fifty million people didn't see the recovery actually true and it's actually true because the entire recovery was based on\nInflating GDP in getting the is pretty simple ... is is I mean that's pretty simple [noise] not that complicated ... if if if you got twenty\nTurning them into the global economy of course you're going to get some GDP Growth the problem was brought to kind of ...\nAnd then where does it go writer we've seen in and where to go right for me the whole Federal Reserve kiwi program was great and worked as a of an ethnic fantastic wealth transfer from the middle class to the wealthy\nAre those that participated in could participate in the stock market have done great\nEverybody else not so much um as we were getting ready to wrap this up uh we're talking with Daniel ... he is an economist PHD you know just a a great wealth information what did I not ask you today that you think is an important point that we need to talk about\nI think that's the point that we need to talk about it's simply well I think we we touched upon it is that if our listeners our viewers are thinking that prevents will become more caught them into a ... already into a global recession or slow down\nThere riding the bus bugs don't take that as a volition signal for\nRisky access because everybody believes and when everybody believes that something is going to happen it doesn't happen so think about what happened in the ... in the European market I think about what happened in Japan and uh it it takes the the take the the opportunities that the market will give him some you know some balances\nTo reduce exposure to sit for reducing exposure to the ... if you have to be a hundred percent invested like explosions and censor goes reduce exposure to a ... parents with low fix a foreign exchange reserves\nAnd and and and and take those opportunities instead of believing that it will come back to uh\nTo do other than Ninety thousand eleven levels\nAbsolutely

crop the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stressed that I spend a lot of time on here today\nIs how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets whether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the kids cause there's three directions and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invested it if we invest into that we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth a just war the heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be directional lead dependent to know what I mean by that is we can't only profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach at stake last year it on like trade economy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to view down markets as opportunity not just bad things you have so many times the down markets are viewed as well\nThat still bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major crashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes\nWorld and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nHere's one one racing graduate had to say\n... to me as taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kids are inside it because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together in the family um I get my trading nine and die there how\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed up learned more visitors on line at Houston ... that's Houston oh gee a dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to our trading radio down to the show\nWe'll come back and here's a shooting in humans Larry Jacobs director of a structure the moment and half instructor training really shed some light on consistent returns in the market [noise] one of my favorite holiday of talking about this in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success it had some success in\nThe market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money at the markets are going up being able to make money and the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the marks or going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come\nI learned a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyle with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to rebuild this was a primary source of income such a great question right you know\nWhat I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy they can they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for its freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... ... thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to get the Haitian people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in and they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to the point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough sick about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half the classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class\nYou know the happy classes or three hours long if you end up winning a a set a ticket sort of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat is that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on what was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish it's like oh I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time and to have income coming from somewhere else having a supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build up supplemental income it can be through a passive channel they could be through an active channel it can be through commodity that could be dropped into can be through stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... it is one of the you always talk about I guess I should say Larry it's in multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic can you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stressed city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit saving device little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out in these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be a better not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net and that nice piece of stability\nAnd you know you're thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're going to laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a fraud can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box ... couple of times the ... the top lid and even if that little way they still can't jumping the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize just subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or the definition of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked itself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now there are only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom in doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and one of the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more these passes what he'd say let's do it right now he's happy class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that supplemental income whether it's active income with its or commodities whether it's through stocks\nDoesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half the class is about three hours long and now you're looking for that great or warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rate of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win instead of passes the one of these have to classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over including with your passes are professional insiders kitten kitten packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nButtons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you can get started right now\nCause down through twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats and the number is paid\nFive five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero for for for if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh da da and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down the income conversation we were talking about supplemental income and primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nPeople off with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and what ... said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly will send out at all in fact most of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard that expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means as they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things\nThat are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could have worked just one more day that would have been excellent now they're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd so I think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you may get a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself\nAnd so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking his big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the marketing locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine\nYet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect water to grow and to get them out to one of the half the class was ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got a ... class coming up in your area and a half the cost of ... exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify the turning point up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win it said it passes or one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes it's going to be our professional insiders KIPP is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now goes down through twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight five five eight to five zero for for for that day five five eight to five zero four four four and he ended up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up in Houston oh da da dum and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I ... I Would say to everybody ... and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars of that the classes were you really get to see exactly what it takes\nTo really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and us just doing the right things with our money you know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices of the kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall in every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know what is it being the same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time and don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away [laughter]\nYeah well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in Iraq or some type of retirement plan which is great then nothing against that\nPoor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money after the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're on an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market correction will that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we had an earlier the market falls three times faster than it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's kick it a step further when the market goes down that dramatically like it did in two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the four pictures in housing dividend cuts vivid and cuts so all these things\nHave a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and not a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got a happy class got up in your area that big classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating I'm focusing on\nBuilding out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna have a chance when set of passes on these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes going to be a professional insiders kitten

some light on retirement we're talking about protecting retirement accounts were talking about how to generate more income inside of the retirement\nAccounts and really how important it is to have still multiple streams of income even as we roll into those retirement years\nYou know building out the stability whether we're twenty or whether we're two hundred and Twenty years old right building out that stability building out that consistent income so that we don't have any question marks in our life and one of the things that we really didn't touch on that last segment maybe we'll get onto next week\nIs really how many question marks happen the older we get you know what's it called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all also\nThe older we get you know it's called a surprise because it's something we didn't plan on and there's all all sorts of things that happened\nOr as we start going down that talked track in fact it's always interesting to me how when we talk to people who have not retired you put them in the same room you put it in the people who have not retired and the people who have retired and he asked the people who have not retired\nDo you think you can live off left and they all say yes and then you talk to the people who have retired and you say can you live off left and they go no because there's so many unexpected come up as we get a little more miles on our body I mean what you just go down the healthcare path but this\nBut there's just so many things that come up that multiple streams income ended up being very very critical now ends up being very very important to create that night stability now whether you're just tuning and maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nGet excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners are not quite sure they have enough time to really even add investing into their life you know after all\nThere's only twenty four hours of the day and right now we're using all of them and and the thing I Would like to bring up in Hollywood right there's all sorts of movies that have trading and there's also the TV shows have investing in it\nAnd they show it let's all encompassing kind of a lifestyle when in reality it's not that the average trader doesn't have Eighteen computer monitors the average trader didn't just take their hypertension medication errors treated not sweating profusely right now in fact when you're doing is appropriately your proactively investing\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in and that's that's one of the things I I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of their life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom well\nThe first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason pour stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThat people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're

magenta stuff into metal sequestering agent which removes the metals and minerals the calcium and scale build up from the water it puts it all in the western state I Know a lot of you are using the magenta stuff as well what's at all and in some ... state\nAnd then what does it do with it\nThat's what jak asked me\nWhat is it doing it yeah it puts it ended up ... her\nSo the reason why our
