Morgan Chase Citigroup and other big events in banking firms have changed their rules to add sweeteners three hundred employees they're basically saying look we're going to do ... gratification and

they're just adapting\nSo sometimes I'm a young people\nAnd I usually I'm involved with a couple of interns every summer to go to our corporate headquarters\nSometimes I go oh my gosh I'm worried and then sometimes I'm just highly encouraged\nBut there are experts that work on this all the time a lot of major companies bring them in and they're saying look millennial employees are a little bit more confusing\nBut thinking Sylvie amazing you just have to figure out how to work with them\nThey give them article is getting married right and she's now going to be\nBut they couldn't give me your price until they knew more about me and they said you know I Know you want to know where you're going to spend most coal measure so we want to invest time go to your house and measure it'll tell you what it's tougher\nUm suffered ever say no when someone's put all that time in\nBut I kind of said hey you know what I'm I make sure I can measure myself I've like surprising I went to a third place and they said hey see\nHere's the premium so fast and I don't think it's worth it it's thirty percent more than ten percent better here's the cheapest and you don't want that and they basically said look here's the value here's it's competitively priced here's data here's how you compare\nAnd then I had complete information and it made it easier to make a decision [noise] so I've noticed in building houses there are many different approaches and I will say the Houston is a very very competitive market\nAnd on production home the pricing is um man I don't I'm not going to test all the calls me all the production homes but price per square foot polling slows almost anywhere in the country\nSo I have a very close friend who we had a lot of talks about it and I built from customers before and he went through it and and here's kind of here's the different models\nAnd it will tell you that I used to ... he was amazing I also have friends at partners in building and I love the way they do things so one custom home builder in round top Texas um\nWill not do a bit on the ... and the federal plans because he\nJust uh the guy he just doesn't want to do competitive bidding and get into that what he wants to do with the work with you and help you develop the plans and drive around and look at examples and see the work and have a lot of discussions and develop as they gather in any charges more\nIn in ... it's fine and if you could afford it it's fine it's it's a premium prices premium relationship\nAnd it's all about the relationship [noise] I Know a builder the bills homes just outside of Houston and he'll give a for a price and the other guy\nBut\nHe he doesn't give you an outfit allowing says I have a friend of both the custom home really beautiful porches Tin Roof whole bit and there's nothing wrong with this but it was a one piece shower what it was and I'm a Carl shower\nRight and the floors work hard woods there were lamb and it looked like would so\nAnd the floors work hard woods there were laminate it looked like what so that builder we'll give you a price and then really get you on the upgrades and you know if you're halfway through building a house\nAnd um I mean you're not in a position to go competitively shop I Know some builders that will do costs plus but in that kind of a contract the builders the most sophisticated\nAnd I'm In the home owner is less sophisticated but the homeowner has the most risk in the contract\nAnd then I'll tell you a bottle I really liked the partners of buildings using a poet Kelly Bell testosterone and we had Kelly Hi good morning\nAre you there Philly Kelly relatives to can't hear Brussels have there and he told me\nOh I Gotcha are you are you with me oh\nYes you hear me yeah I got an email I'm Sorry I didn't get get get hey you know how\nI was talking about different approaches to the building house\nSo if partners and building they want to get their plan they want you to go pick out everything counter tops floor covering tile every inch and then they give you for a price and you're done with it or you have\nYou know I I had I had a terrible experience with a client that was working with a builder and then north hysteria and\nOne of the things that that the older I I I don't know if they end up priced that contract to begin with and how he made money up on his client was he would basically on every change order even if they stayed within allowance now if they change something it was twenty percent\nAnd ... things that that they were still in the same time\nAllowance and now that they would change something um ... different lighting or different you know feel the same cost that they would still charge them the twenty percent it was ... I felt so sorry I had to clients dealing with this filter came out and as a horrible experience for both of these clients I had\nA builder once in a misspelled or actually went out of business on the house after a\nWhile and um what a Fifteen hundred dollars to go to treat them and it wasn't that big of a tree I could have gotten a couple of redneck buddies and a six pack of\nBeer for them and I would have been gone in about twenty minutes\nTo go for about two hundred [laughter] oh yeah two hundred bucks bucks and six beer [noise] um I wouldn't have been drinking those beer myself but I Would have passed them at the end of the day right safety for right right right Oh absolutely yeah but there were some builders it will just get you on the end\nSo I have a client whose er physician and he built a home outside of Houston really nice house like an eight hundred thousand dollar house which is was less than four thousand square feet\nAnd the builder what two hundred thousand dollars over him in and basically um\nMy clients and look this is a great Christian God that go to church with a friend of mine are presumed my whole life for the way the contractors\nWritten because there was a lot more work in the foundations of other changes some roofing discrepancies\nGolly two hundred thousand bucks over and I really think the builder was like man this guy did physician and he's got a ton of money drives a really nice car I mean I'm going to make some money on this deal\nPut it all happened when you're too far in telling with somebody's borrowing money to build a house\nYou can't just go change builders in loans can you\nThat's correct especially if you do you let it you know one time ... you're not alone is closed up front so any overruns or anything that you change that adds money on to the project is a dollar\nFor dollar out of your pocket so it it's really important to know because if you don't have it attention that you have the in the bank to pay for overruns or to pay for unexpected things that come up you can get a whole pretty quickly\nIt can get pretty stressful hint how typical is it than someone builds a house in their stretching financially when they build it\nOut you know um [noise] I see it from time to time I mean thankfully um it's not all the time but I Do see where people are stretching it you know what am I dealt with several clients that you have to kind of you know\nPull it back in and say this is this is all that we can do and and you know it's it's designed not to prevent people from doing its assets to prevent people from getting into a situation like we were talking about and he knew even ... contracts how's this going to tell you were talking earlier about costs plus contracts flush a lot of things and\nA lot of um financial institutions will make you have a contingency in your loan and if he will cost us contracts because we want to make sure there's extra money in case of Iran's and prices going up after the fact and all that good stuff\nThat makes sense when you say the majority of people to build a house on costs clubs in the spending a lot more money\n\nYes I Do maybe not a lot but I Do see it over and\nOkay so that makes sense um five minutes or partners and building you fill up with new haven't you\nYeah they are tremendous still there and they do things right they they they do things at from like you were talking about it so good for them to go see that with the customers to get all that stuff to take out\nIt just eliminate 'em ... cost overruns and um it ... the people I've worked with every partners in buildings have far are really truly professional people\nThings they do a great job okay so I had a discussion with someone about a home and I gave them some advice and then you can tell me if you agree or disagree so this is at a fluent couple\nAnd they were kind of design in their house and I'm Wondering backup for second feet and Kramer my home does our friends since you're usually the process somebody meets with ... or they lay out their dream house they go get a bid they go\nOh I'm In trouble and then they come back and make the health smaller okay [noise] ah because they go wow this is expensive [laughter] I Know a couple\nAnd they designed to house and got a basic estimated price of seven hundred and fifty thousand and then they found another house that was fully completed for about seven hundred thousand\nIn the I'm Sorry\nSeven hundred and Seventy five thousand so that they can build up for seven fifty they found a house down there like almost as well as seven Seventy five\nAnd I said if it's close I Would go with the seven Seventy five\nPay more but you know exactly what you're getting you don't have cost overruns you play do my window treatments the landscape things in the sprinklers them um you know I almost think if you spend a hair more in no there are no big surprises\nIt helps if you're rich and the United states of America the richest one percent of
