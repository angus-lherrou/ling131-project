story of the kind of the backstory Jody of ah that song in particular was\nA people might be familiar with Granger Smith the play right a lot of the uh he says you know Texas country artist sex is kind of your station plays a lot of the venues around here and in fact a a Skeeter had done something for me that uh uh was just incredible it was one of those beyond the pale kind of of things and\nAnd uh ran into a Granger Smith through a friend of mine who knew him and had done some work for 'em and\nAnd uh they played this song and thought this would be a great Skeeter saw it it just had that Skeeter field to Iran so we uh send a couple of the radio shows over the Granger and he'd listen to a couple of the programs and\nAnd he wrote the lyrics rewrote the lyrics it with a song was originally a different song on one of his uh uh albums but he rewrote the lyrics for the song after hearing writer\nAnd came up with that particular song and I remember a a civil let's go test drive those Carlos Skeeter get in the car with me and let's go and I plugged into the\nThe thing and play the song for them and I I never saw I'm close to tears but it was a it was probably the score\nSo fit and you know when the first show started and for years when we use the top gun theme mhm for the intro I'm a music and that's what it was made of and then I remember Skeeter bringing a CD to the shop\nAnd he says hey we got this Peter song that's all we got all Skeeter song that's the one who's saying that\nYou know and he said he said oh it's a young guy that Martin McCoy knows when I was like well that sounds pretty cool so that converted that over to the show and made it the Skeeter song and there was actually Granger Smith\nAlbum songs so that different words you just going to change the word so that's how I came about and then um a few years later\nGranger actually came and did the show was either I think downtown at the convention center and you were there with them as well and and graders went on to be a pretty successful artist he's a big deal out of there you know they're just kind of give a lift there was a little uh a history of\nDon't tell them we don't want to be able to come back and overall things for you to do that\nIn fact I remember um uh we my wife and I met up with the Iranian Skeeter at the armadillo palace right now and a ranger was playing there and so we are connected with Granger there and then he changed the words back he was kind of going back and forth from the original words to the song\nTo the skaters song but right there in front of everybody a converted the song uh was doing the skiers on live always had a recording of a soda and it was just great to see Skeeter being he was\nIt's all in live always had a recording of soda and a and it was just\nGreat to see Skeeter beam he was just a meaning he was always smiling anyway you always saw that life but there was a little extra beam I think that might surprise you know it's great to see that I think even the\nAnd I was just talking with people this morning at and they don't call him so there's hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands and thousands that don't call in\nAnd they were saying yeah I heard about here I said man he was he knew everything about cars you know that's the good stuff that they said about and that's cool to run into somebody that doesn't

and a half you have to start taking money out\nIn in what they're saying is look we're gonna let you wrote taxes for put in pre tax but it's not a forever thing\nIf you don't take out\nYour required

guidelines your situation might\nBe unique talked to tax expert okay okay okay thanks thanks okay Bye bye\n[noise] okay why talking about I raised we can talk about getting ripped off when you're traveling so my family was with another family in in Italy and we stayed at a nice hotel\nAnd the major nice it is to a great neighborhood restaurant for pizza and of course we went from and they said just a you know that sort of Roger Clemens is from and this guy was amazing\nI think we have like for pizza's just like a hundred and twenty bucks which seems shocking to me but right\nI'm In another country um green I don't know what's going on I found out later that there are restaurants there including this one that two men use one for locals that one for dumped her as we got the higher prices\nWell I should have been suspicious by now we got ready to leave the hotel when you have a family or you know me and my wife three kids we can't get in a taxi\nWe need to make taxi I go to the major D. or to the doorman I Need a taxi great I'll get it twenty minutes later I'm Still waiting and we've got to go to the airport\nAnd there's a big taxi across the street\nLike a like a van taxi so am I doorman I go I go and we need the big tax egos they're coming they're coming and I said what about that one feels no no you don't want to use that one just wait till about ten minutes later\nThe doorman still doesn't have any ... sexy and there's one still across the street there'd been a couple of his one left I Walk over the city can you take us to the airport sure\nSo I get my wife my kids are baggage walk across the street get in and and the drivers speak good English and I said why why does our dorm and not tell us to use you and he said because we don't give him kickbacks it all worked some kickbacks\nSo to another point in this was near the leaning tower a he's a\nA friend and I we have our families were getting in in a taxi line there are lots of people\nWere going to congested tourist area by praying gets at a taxi and goes I getting a taxi behind him and go I pull up Mike I sit in a couple of buttons he wants so much money I gave it to him I tip them\nBut my buddy is in the taxi in front of me and he's getting out the same time you know and it's really um they're kind of captured traffic I Walk up look at my buddies taxi I lean in the window and look and here's fair was like half\nOf what month there was so I've gotten out of my cab paid a high fair walk to the next cab who we had followed\nAnd their happens months I look back at my my driver and Italy and he laughs rolls down the window and it gives me like the equivalent twenty dollars back like you caught me that's okay I have a good day\nSo now I Know I pay too much for pizza I almost missed Kennedy Airport because there wasn't a kickback for the government at the hotel and the taxi driver tried to screw me and of course everybody knows this if you get in a taxi\nAnd you're in a new city or new country and they say have you been here before\nSometimes they're they're saying if I screw you will you know it right\nI mean it it's easier to track today on\nYour phone if you're going to the right place but if you get in a taxi they say if you've been here before it you've said yes I take this route all the time you're much less likely to get screwed than if you go [noise]\nNo I've never been here I Wonder how far it is is it more than four hours I mean then yeah you can end up paying more\nFor the fourth time screwed Italy I'm I'm at a train station with my wife and some other friends to train comes up and she gets on the person on her left bumps or hard\nA naturally hard kind of a shoulder to shoulder and then the persona right leans into her image also my wife knows foolishly she her ... her hand back [noise]\nSo that felt weird as we get on the train to go to Steve I just got jostled in my wallet gone somebody's taking my wallet and then she points to that lady there got on the train with me and now she's already off\nSo my friend yells go get them\nYeah that's that's that's inspirational high jump off the train run up to the lady throw my hands in the air you know to fight through my hands in the air and I'm On my tip toes I'm probably at least five for I'm I'm like you to my watch wallet I Want it back\nI Know you did it and I'm screaming could have been some six four guy I probably\nWouldn't have done that I've said excuse me and my wife while it back but I'm yelling and making quite the scene I Know it's hard to believe so a girl to the back of me go ... here's your wife's wallet she dropped on the ground why why follow was laying on the ground\nI grabbed it and got on the train and all this happened for the door shut again [noise] so what do we put it together here's what happened [noise] one person John from my wife on the left the one on the ride jostle to reach in took her wallet and handed it to a third person\nAnd two of those people got on the train and then got right walk down the aisle and got off the next door\nSo there's so many ways and I will say\nCould I I maybe I could go to ... I'd be boycotted for this\nIt was for ladies\nWho happened to fit the stereotype\nOf a group that often does those kinds of things\nSo a lot of marijuana stocks come out of Canada Canada in your way have legalized recreational marijuana I think those are the only to quote unquote countries that have done that Canada historically it's been a hotbed for small energy companies but\nI Know they have over a hundred and twenty marijuana companies all because the stock exchange\nSo if you said to me wow what was the Internet ride like I said boy was a crazy and if you said to me what's the newest Internet craze I'd call it marijuana madness because uh those stocks it's kind of like it's really like rolling the dice again I'm not involved and certainly not recommending him but\nIf you said where is crazy money up and down called back and forth or really volatile find someone to stay away from their marijuana madness on Wall street\n[noise] how much money does it take to be rich wealth for most of us has just certainly more than what we have we'd like to have a little bit more money right I mean no matter what you make usually want just a little bit more\nBut there's an organization called wealth acts they do a wall or world ultra wealth report enemy ultra wealthy they say you need to have thirty million dollars\nWhat countries have the most people worth thirty bucks\nNumber one usa number to Japan three China China in so many people\nWalk a little followed by Germany and Canada\nTo the United states of America Says somebody to two hundred and fifty five thousand people have net worth of thirty million dollars had him if you look at people were thirty million how to most of them get it\nOr they have their own business it's like a combination of real estate and having your own business but typically not working for someone can you inherited yes\nBut really thirty million bucks a lot of that would know three four generations it's probably gone I mean you think about it if you have thirty million and you died with three kids yeah if you have ten million\nIf all three of your kids have three kids if they just didn't have any every kid gets three point three million\nUsually a thirty million dollar steak doesn't grow because people are spending mode I mean for generations probably not much to think about it'd be fun to try to thirty million makes you alter rich pull it take care of your family forever will big question mark on that\n[noise] I've seen Drake says KFC money matters if you work overseas\nThe United states treats their citizens in an unusual way they tax you on income in the U.S and income overseas\nFor years many people would hide money overseas Swiss bank accounts right you grew up hearing that oh there goes was fake account\nAnd then in two thousand and eight the Justice Department took UPS the court\nThey what they did what we called piercing the veil of bank secrecy they got a lot of data on people got ... got after folks who ride money\nPanama Papers were a bunch of like stolen documents released publically I think it was a law firm out of Panama and it was really figured out wow it is amazing how many people are already money overseas so\nThe Internal Revenue service said look if you have overseas account you haven't claim that complain\nTo settle up and I think they're waving interest penalties in jail time they have a lot of money come back because of that but now that's kind of over the ... is still going after off shore tax cheats\nHere's where it's getting hurting normal everyday people that aren't cheating\nIs estimated there for a million us citizens that live overseas\nAnd do what they have to go through now just to have a bank account the red tape and it's almost crazy\nIn fact his two thousand eight twenty five thousand ex pats them get up to you is give it up to US citizenship\nAnd often you pay ... ... attacks you know in their view you pay an extra tax\nSo anyway kind of interesting if you go overseas you lived there for a long time or work reassuring the all the tax rules because in the process of going after people who are cheating is causing headaches for a lot of people who actually word cheating\nThe races on to make the movie\nAbout the soccer team rescued and the cave there were twelve young athletes that assistant coach there in the mountains of northern
