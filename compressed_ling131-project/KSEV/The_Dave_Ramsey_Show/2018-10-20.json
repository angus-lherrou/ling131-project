of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states [noise]\nYes and actually put a six year in a row and that again is all because of our clients so thank you guys I Hope those if you listen to show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about\nSomething that I think is a very important it is very important to us but I'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen is that um you know I think that you're financially you'll be successful but I also think will be successful in life\nAnd so the same kind of things that it takes to have a successful business as successful financial adviser for him I think are the same sort of things that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm going to apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this segment on ... you are the most important person in the entire world so as I mentioned in the previous segment I we we not work with the uh eight thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you got grandparents children grandchildren\nAnd in some cases great grandchildren it really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do enjoy your\nHow can we keep money matters enduring\nOr it wouldn't be irresponsible of of us you know with regard to our clients and and their families so we we have we called vision one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong are stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are what we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brings it doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do with your valleys so in your family it it would be the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera\nThis is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life\nAnd if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera so this segment is you are\nThe most important person in the world so we have to core values that applied that number two number four is a core value number two says that our clients benefits before we do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless\nIf everything you do is geared around helping others that what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works it's this magic that happens it's sometimes called karma sometimes it's called the golden rule it it's there's ... ... what reaping and sewing\nWell it it's there's it's a ... ... what reaping and sewing I mean the religion it's talk about it all the time and if you focus entirely on ... those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had it because that's our philosophy that's how we live\nSo that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meeting that we have with our senior financial ah partners are our senior partners where we talk about\nStrategy we talk about uh you know what we're going to do with given market conditions and all kinds of things and in that meeting we had a chair it's an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we say is we want to always imagined that climate sitting in that room with us while we're having this meeting\nAnd we always used that as our litmus test that client sitting in that room with us with day approve of what we're saying in this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we like a scum of the earth we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo they kind of go to you know behave as if somebody's watching you all the time they have as if what you're doing is is it's impacting others because when you start looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming ... you close up and you close up\nOpening to all the opportunities that are out there for you core value number four said if a client calls us we lost\nAnd what I mean by that is is that if people rely on you ... you know you have to think of yourself as they are servant you know we feel like we work for everybody\nYou know I'm the c._e._o. of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works at our firm I'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job the best they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we say if the client calls that we lost what I mean by that is that if a client called us about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or if there's something going on the markets or anything that a client would call it's about we should be a head of that we should be pro actively\nCommunicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call it so therefore if a client cause that we lost now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right they moved\nOr you know there's a change in their life or something happened those situations obviously a client calling us we didn't lose but anything that we should have told them first we did lose so in your life I think about people and uh how you run your business or if you're a if you work you know your boss your the people that report up to you your peers\nGet them informed about what's going on don't ever let somebody call you and say hey what's going on with that\nWhen you told them you were on top of it keep them informed at all times and you'll give them peace of mind don't trust you and you'll be ... and I think you'll be happier in the process as well that there is no doubt\nOkay now we are a financial advisory firm or not a a philosophical firmly do apply but we're what we preach uh and uh we would like to work with you if you're over fifty retired are retiring soon so this is you then that's who\nWho\nSpecialize in working with so if you have questions about your pension plan do you take a pension or a lump sum if you've inherited money if you're newly widowed or if you are retired uh or retiring soon you have

a take it the right way you want to get income from your investments all those kinds of things that's what we do\nAnd we'd like to work with you if it's if we could so here's my offer you go to our

declines and\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about what I Love it and most valued clients will not work with us\nSame idea as we talk about with our love it and most valued clients will not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial adviser for him in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our Lebanon most valued clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you are doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is it something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory firm die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are mad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for ... for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or the or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over the course of time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you would you built we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money you can invest in you know think bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down if you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last\nThen you could be down you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually salad that's when you realize the value that you created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that it's a value\nSo therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAren't we have ten core values and I want to share with you core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because risk is not your friends\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns it's not really your friend\nOkay people who take high risks you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they have the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan ... so when we tell us what we tell people in fact we say that that are seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible then here's what I recommend\nSell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turned it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcases full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red\nOkay we're big bat now if we hit we're going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem it it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returns Vegas awaits but somewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting at all on red live how much risk you should take\nAnd our goal philosophically in life and I think your goal in life should be the same thing is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish their goals\n\nYou [laughter] well I Love you back because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with ah Michael Douglas rate says greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way of spanking greedy people's bottom bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a ... you don't want that that's not a pretty sight okay you don't want ... red chicks so take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals so it making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent interest that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk because it's necessary to accomplish hurdles\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I Want to tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors\nUm or you'd like to go to one of our seminars\nA I encourage you to do that go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website and when you're there you can you can click on meat with an advisor if you do that at last you to put your and fall in there we'll

any money just trying to get the word out about how great it is a reverse mortgages\nThere's three uh programs at the federal government has put out for ... for seniors are and and this is what I'm the first would of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now you're sixty two older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes on our of our lives and why would we want to cash in on something as great as this reverse mortgage out on my wife and I did I just didn't want for my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and just tons and tons of people they're fired me on the radio or it's really exciting and society wanting to get out\nUm somebody referred then almost like a ministry well it's not as good as the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good ministry to help people\nAnd ... when we're in our seniors and in our lives are all them financial that brick and yet as well as spiritual out as as well received\nOf ... I I like to go through the questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how all this reverse mortgage work thing and make a simplified for your\nFirst question how do I have to be and this is cutting stone there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older\nAnd you can be as always right I mean Ninety nine and a hundred and ... there's no top and and but the the lowest you can be in sixty two years of age and if you're a married\nThen that person also needs to be sixty two her older so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people call me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five was fifty a well you don't get the average it out you both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone back then the state of Texas\nA okay who alone the home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody sell the government owns your home the mortgage company owns your home well heck if you have a traditional mortgage and you pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nAt six twelve can you know road called to eight one nine nine nine three one nine one extension zero if you're interested in fostering an animal before it's time is up the shelter will provide adequate and food if needed they'll even covered necessary vetting cause but medical care must be provided shelter itself to be free\nPlease step up and helping the animal need my fostering are adopting in this moment of crises\nThank you for being a part of the solution we're Houston proud and remember I doubt don't shop\nVoice of Texas A M seven hundred K. I. V.\n[noise]\n\nVery proud of welcome back to the right mass irreversible you show I'm writing math is really really excited sided just\nRead the news or the reverse mortgage uh I've just briefly but what we mentioned in the first section to the federal government has established three wonderful programs for seniors and the first one was for Social Security\nA church and I don't see anybody set of those back I Know my wife and I know that's a wonderful program and then when you're sixty five you get Medicare\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or go no money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity\nOut of your home and they make a loan to you and the and you still have plenty of equity left us not alone so I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to\nYour payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgage then when we get the haven't\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart we love him dearly and we've accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do\nThis to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments they zero forever I don't care how long you live\nA wonder if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you cash in addition to that\nSo if you're home that say well your your home and your age it goes by home an agent of what the value of your home and how old you are a let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you've got to Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off to Seventy five give you a hundred\nAnd twenty five cash hundred and twenty five thousand dollars cash but about Seventy five thousand uh that helps you and your later years that helps you to retire I mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me and you got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call and Inquirer\nSo you can get educated on it then once you understand it you'll do the reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nIt's just all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government and we're taking advantage of it and the money we gave me you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that I really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount down and we finance their balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away into both of you pass away if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a ... a home you have a more his own our home that's clear that they don't do anything on\nWe'll get to that part of it in a minute\nI Need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because you're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for home you say you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make and how much expenses are and and then that's how they ...\nThat's when his erode you don't have to figure it inside doesn't take as much income\nAnd um when you invest your money with us if you want to let's say you could get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever can pay our bills or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of a broader\nYou put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth funding is no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she did you get your house paid off of your your thing on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us we play it safe for like two percent tax free even when you pull that out I mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did not setting it up for our\nOur our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compound among the so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always say it's not tax deferred where you pay later is tax free\nNow if my home it's clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you really run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house but then and a daughter Molly money buy a cup of coffee but what will they'll let us take part of that but not all of it just a small part in the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever so if you've got a\nTwo hundred thousand dollar house and we can learn to a hundred thousand\nNow you've got a house they just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I Would just use part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house of equity you've got a hundred thousand in cash to anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that Holden that home every month at home and gives you nothing it doesn't send you a check then send you any money but it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and\nNew air conditioners and Bruce and painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't say your money I'm sure your way to how he is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let that cash drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping it secret anymore I Want to know about it and all that should just call it inquiry ask questions if you're one outcome your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's already set me free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nAnd then I'd be all over the I've been all over the phone doing that and\nAnd I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also it is a no brainer for folks that are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two in the state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house and is it your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away in ... Arizona house so\nNo thinking somebody else's house because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true how much a pain to chat me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and likely to go to having a hunting time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so it just made all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and let the people I'm really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for you being sixty tour older every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or a banker who marry and senator\nWhen I can erase it and give you a cash I mean I don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payments are asking the right thing in pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a ... a malefactor that I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar my payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got to wait for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call you'll hear from ray Massey MA essence you why you don't hear from a secretary on here for my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out texture so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nGovernment shutdown the day that right that's like a ministry to you and I said yes it is and the way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to do I want you to call a thought five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money will give you use it for anything you want you can pay off bills getting help relatives\nYou can do that ... church she can do anything you want with it you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it he's putting our savings account or six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo after you just need to call they found five to six six sixteen hundred\nYou can just sheer money just do whatever you want as bad as plain as it gets on on when you get the cash you not limited [noise]\nUh what if I Want to purchase a home and that's what my wife and I did I tell everybody we're in that same house forty years I loved that house where kids grandkids are buying more fun\nBut now we're in her seventies and we wanted a single story in a smaller pool so we moved to Katie and David we could build as a home and we're thrilled with it we're not leaving there until we go to heaven\nAnd a handle payments up there either so we have no payments for eternity and you can to\nUh so you actually can purchase a home what happens you just make a down payment\nWe finance their ballots and then there's no payments on that balance ever as long as you live there and it doesn't keep you from moving let's say a month from now a year from now two years some circumstances come up you want to be their grandkids or whatever you can still sell the house you sell it pay off your mortgage\nStill have plenty of equity they use that equity go by another home that is a reverse purchased for you so you just pay a down payment on that one has knows payments again\nSo forget a sexist it's such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if your homes clear and we'll get home clear for them and a little while because of their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call 'cause I can give you money on part of your equity in that house has already cost a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm\nOn a purchase kind of still a vast you inching and Sylvester the savings account they come to a lot of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify you know you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero as opposed to that's getting a normal ... let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations don't have to be made when you're not going to have a payment so there's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh will call me a five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could pull up beat out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear if your car is clear that and the good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMakes you some money for your retirement I mean they say you can get to know what price your home is let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThan if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led and her six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes on that but you don't on the uh money from the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home you know that how homeless ... even though you don't make a personal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying ... does your ... some job I root for fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out take some of that cash and put it into a savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some males especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those are the ones who can go up to twenty and thirty percent I don't know how it goes but I go hide\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six Fifteen hundred I'd probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I can just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore [noise]\nWell when you're homeless Claire you know they have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust call me I I like to tell me one thing that this is a man how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent of voters he got that set up for seniors\nSixty to an older so if you're under sixty three you don't qualify now when you hit the sixty two you can that right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo don't keep making payments on your health if you have a clear house\nGreat I'll give you some cash to help you and your retirement you don't have to make payments on it ever again Cyril payments for life but it doesn't restrict you from moving you still knew so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire\nAnd so you had to make some income my wife and I play in the money we haven't we plan on one day saying they start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's going to be great for us and our retirement and we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else rare and now we're set so I'm just trying to get\nThese checks and whatever else rail and now we're set\nSo I I'm just trying to get you said I was trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent\nI'm not selling it unexplained again and it's up to you if you want to do it so don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision\nBut if you don't make the phone call that cheerful I mean I think make it out on the phone and don't even know who you are out there yet until you didn't call me so it's up to you if you want to make life easier for you and your later years\nOh you have to do and you're a homeowner want to be a whole motor that all you have this call right Nancy and they said the why with reverse mortgage\nEight five five to
