conservative talk radio actually leave several member damn the voice of tracks or [noise]\n\nOr easily [noise]\nMainly is\nLeaving [noise]\nI'm are more have her one hand we are back to his money matters with Ken All right but of course I Am your host can re\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talked about on this show these are the very same idea that we talked about without a lot of it and most valued clients\nAnd now we we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so most of our focus is on that retirement planning and so is this show and so that's you know we're here for you\nEnd up with the second year in a row now money matters or with ... that would be are from the finalists were finalists or ... or the two thousand Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics which is a mouthful\nBut basically uh we are up for it for the second year in a row as an award winner for the better Business Bureau toward toward for ethics [noise]\nYes and that would be winners will be announced November first at the awards ceremony and I'll tell you whether we win it or not but we are\nUm I think honored adjusted to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics and all that and says but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money is because we are financial advisors as I mentioned\nAnd one of the functions that we perform for our clients as we manage your money for them and what we tell them is you know that uh we're going to take care of we're going to manage your money for your job is to go and take a cruise okay we love you but get out of here [laughter] see you later take off do go beat the guy\nAnd we want you to not even think about your finances we want you to enjoy and we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nYou and I love you back and so you know we want our clients to be out there having fun and enjoying whatever they think of as their best to retirement okay so we want that for you and so one of the things that we believe or to make that happen it's very important is to protect\nThe nest egg to protect the money the investments that you have built up over all the years that you were saving and and all that so that you could retire and you know as I mentioned earlier in the show and we talked about it cash flow\nIs the primary thing that we look at when it comes to your retirement meaning that we want to make sure that to the extent that we can that the income you have coming in is going to be more than the expenses you have going out and we want that to be the case for the rest of your life\nOkay so if we can do that then you had a successful retirement we've covered your cost of living and we you been able to go out and enjoy your second childhood and all this well\nNow cash flow is a function of\nThe amount of money you have to generate that income to generate that cash flow right so the more money you have the more cash flow you can generate a less money you have the less cash flow you can generate does that make sense okay so therefore it's a bear market comes\nAnd you lose thirty forty or fifty percent of your money like many people did and Y. two K. and in two thousand eight then what could happen is that your cash flow can be cut in half\nRight or by whatever amount that your investments dropped and\n[noise] it wouldn't\nBe a big bummer no kidding and if that were to happen to you then what would that do would you be able to cut back like that okay because if you can't cut back if your if your expenses are fixed and your ability to cash\nFlow those expenses is a you know hurt by a bear market then you're going to be spending more than your investments can generate which means that you're doing with farmers called eating your seed corn and if you do enough of that then when groceries income guess what you'll have nothing left", "show_name": "The
