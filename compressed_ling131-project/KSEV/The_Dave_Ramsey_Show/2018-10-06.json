let's do that [noise] ah well let me introduce myself this is money matters with Ken more right than I Am your host Kenmore right\n[noise] I have been in\nThe financial services business now for I've been a certified financial planner professional rather for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we currently work with a over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that's you this show is designed for you and uh in two thousand Fifteen forms named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd you know without our beloved clients we would be no worse so I give that one to them and uh for those of you who are not clients you can go to our website money matters dot net\nWe have podcasts on this show therefore you we have videos on Social Security and all all the things that we can think of to help you with your retirement planning we have articles are all kinds of stuff so money matters dot net at our website\nSo we're going to talk now about\nWhat ... what we believe when when you retire\nYou know you kind of become a defensive coordinator who want to put it in football term okay so when you are working and you're accumulating your on off that's right so you're building you're putting money in your you have wages and all those kind of things that you're living on that and you're putting your money away and so therefore and you have time on your side\nAnd so because of all of that you can be more aggressive in my opinion you can you can take a little bit ah you know a a an aggressive stance but once you are within five years of retirement or five years after that ten year period\nThat is and and we've looked at it we believe it's one of the ... one of the most important periods of your entire financial life\nAnd if you do the math on it and you take a big loss or you do badly during that time you spend too much money or you do any of those kinds of things during that time what could happen is you could actually run out of money and uh that would not be good\nSo as we work with clients are we we take into account or Eighteen risks faced in your retirement\nAnd I I Know Eighteen [laughter] that you thought there were only three right\nBut there are Eighteen and we're going to talk about number seven this week which is\nElder abuse and this is something that if you have a parent who's in their seventies or or older or they are the number one according to a\nA new study that are ... are the targets for this kind of thing and so let me give it some stats on this is actually quite a a disturbing so the annual loss due to elder financial abuse\nTo point six billion dollars or many of the victims are never the same emotionally after being taken advantage of by someone they trust now here's the thing the typical victims\nThe after being taken advantage of by someone they trust now here's the thing the typical victim as a woman seven get eighty nine years old however\nThe victims represent ... there is a diverse profile including older man and ah it also exists across all ethnic and socio economic groups so it's not limited just to a ... women but it is primarily a women\nAre the biggest perpetrators fifty five percent of the perpetrators our families friends\nNeighbors and caregivers\nWhenever I ask what you gotta do the humidity started packing gun\nWell actually that's a little extreme [laughter] I think there might be a better way we'll talk about a better way of doing it then that a fifty percent of family perpetrators are adult\nChildren adult children\nYou know years ago we actually had that happened we had a client whose son was using his power of attorney to steal money from from that um the crimes often involve misuses of power of attorney stealing money using the credit cards you know they they do that borrowing against the elder person's home et cetera\nThe financial abuse perpetrated by businesses can involve large sums of money and I and and do these companies are right you want to call them that these these illegal people they it's like their business and they they can have hundreds of victims okay so what do you do about it well\nNow first of all\nI'm going to give you a little quick checklist here so you can protect yourself from ... up by staying organized you know first of all no where everything you've got it and what it's doing so when you get a call that says you know your your investment or whatever is something happening there you know that it's not true I'm\nOpen and send your own male\nOkay don't have somebody else reads your e mails for you open your mail for you anything like that because they'll get communications that will have your account numbers and all those kind of things on it and then they can take advantage of that same thing with signing of checks and and credit cards and all that kind of thing to do it yourself don't have somebody else to do that for you\nSet up a direct deposits for all checks that you get you know for example Social Security I think make sure that any regular checks that you get a direct deposit it to your back because if they are sent to your house somebody gets it gets wet okay\nUse use your voice mail if you get a call from somebody from a a a a number that you don't recognize don't answer that let it go into voicemail listen to the voice mail and then decide if you want to go after that\nAnd then finally make sure that uh you're wills\nYour advanced directives powers of attorney are executed to ensure that only trusted individuals can step in to make decisions for you okay\nAnd and if you are a child of an older person then those same things would apply for you okay so just something for you to think about now as I mentioned we are a retirement planning specialist we work with people primarily who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that you\nThen or if you go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net\nUm you can sign up for one hour ... we had seminars that talk about your four

philosophy is we don't want to take any more risk than is necessary so you got to figure out what that risk level is and we will help you with that\nAll to talk about your magic number\nOkay so the magic number is how much money do we will help you to calculate what we think is the amount of money you should have to be able to retire on\nAnd so that'll help you to know you have it number one if

R. A. D. E. R. not trade towards the traders um ...\nMost traders have what they call stop off strategy okay they invest but they already know when they're going to sell when they invest that's just smart\nYou know you got to know is Kenny Rogers used to say you got to know when to hold them and when to fold them you don't just keep playing because they are losing hand it's not a good idea so therefore we believe you buy hold and you also selling in November of two thousand seven\nWe told many of the list you know the words into show we and uh and and anybody that gets our weekly market alert email on our clients you said it was time to get out of the stock market or strategy has signaled that and we actually said to stay out for eight almost Eighteen months almost a year and a half\nUm until June of two thousand nine so those of you that followed the that that uh advice you were out of the market and the stock market to er and hopefully that helped to avoid large losses now the by hold argument\nAgainst that that I heard is that if you sell you know what we're going to put it you're going to put it in cash and the answer that I say yes and I mean money markets and that kind of thing uh but if you\nThat you're not going to make any money and so you know that that would really gets makes me actually frustrated because in a in a period of crisis\nYour focus is on protecting its not building I mean think about there's a there's a hurricane coming okay it's a massive hurricane that's coming\nAnd you're saying okay batten down the hatches well no don't do that because now you can't keep building\nWhat does that mean you don't have what are you going to be building for when did the hurricane coming that's not the time to be thinking about building at the time to think about that now the ashes and protect yourself protect their don't let it get crushed in the hurricane\nSo in your investment world thinking about growing at a time when there's a market crisis to me it's like you got your eye on the wrong ball what are you thinking about you got to protect what you have\nSo this notion that you're going cash you don't make any money first of all you know I just agree with that just philosophically the second late you know Benjamin Franklin once said that a penny saved the penny earned\nAnd if you sell and and your investments that you didn't that had you stayed in go down to me whatever they go down by that's your earnings\nOkay so in two thousand eight to ... the ... five hundred index went down what forty percent plus so if you were out of the stock market if you're out of the S. and P. when that happened in my view what that means is the penny saved at forty percent plus that you didn't lose that's the forty percent that you made and to me that's pretty ...\nPresent plots that you didn't lose that's the forty percent that you made and to me that's pretty darn good\nNow the other part of this that I just want to say that yes it's true that right now interest rates are low but just as a novelist you know these interest rates we've seen the last ten years that that's not normal I mean if you go back in history there's very few times and we've had zero percent interest rate\nSo while it's true now I don't know that it's it it would be true in the future also so that whole argument about if you sell them going cash you won't make any money just does not hold water with me All right now if you believe\nIf you are over fifty if you are retired are retiring soon and you believe that uh you want to go enjoy your your second child or do you want to go play and have fun but to do that you believe that you also have to protect what you've\nBuilt then we may be the financial advisory firm for you and so you can go to our website it's money

I I like to go through questions that I think that's the best way to try and figure out how how all this reverse mortgage work thing may go to simplify for your\nFirst question how do I have to be and there's just cutting stone there's no wiggle room you got to be sixty two are older and you can be those around you mean Ninety nine if you order a hundred and ... there's no top paying in but the the lower ... billion sixty two years of age\nIf you're a married then that person also needs to be sixty two her older so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people calling me every week and they'll say well I'm Seventy five my wife's fifty eight well you don't get the average it out\nYou both must be sixty two are older so that's that's set in stone by then the state of Texas\nA okay who alone home that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody said oh the government owns your home the mortgage company owns your home well heck if you have a ... traditional Mario junior pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nFaster than ever before for more information\nMaybe that'll you're definitely W. dot ... dot org slash CBS house\nTogether let's make every cancer patient a long term survivor\nThe NFC cancer is a division of the entertainment industry foundation I don't want to see three charitable organization [noise]\n\n\nVery proud of welcome back to the right mass irreversible you show I'm right now is really really excited to hear side of the spread\nThe news on the reverse mortgage uh I've just briefly but what we mentioned in the first session to the federal government has established three wonderful program for seniors and the first one was the Social Security a church and I say to buy some of those back I Know my wife and I do that's a wonderful program\nAnd then and when you're sixty five you get Medicare\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible\nDo reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or go no money on your whole what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they get maker loan to you and and you still have plenty of equity left is not alone so I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married\nYou both have to be sixty to\nYour payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgage then when we get to heaven\nWe don't have any payments up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have Jesus in our heart when loving for nearly and we've accept them as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll probably to that\nOr how much for your payments they zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity we can pay your entire mortgage off it many times did you catch it in addition to that so if you're home let's say when your your home and your age it goes by home at age or what the value of it home and old you are\nOr let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar level and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred\nAnd twenty five cash hundred and twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand dollar that helps you and your later years that helped to retire\nI mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make it called me if you got to do that part of getting started at least ask question I'm not saying call and say I want to do a mortgage I Want you to call and inquire\nSo you can get educated on it didn't want you to understand that you'll do the reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this was a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government and we're taking advantage of it\nThere's a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government and we're taking advantage of it and the money we gave you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all mortgages for seniors if I can do it uh I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred [noise]\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount of weight finance the balance and guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away into both of you pass away if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do it with a house that you have a more a home you have a more his own our home that's clear that they don't do anything on\nWe'll get to that part of it in a minute\nDon't need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because you're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you say you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make and how much expenses are and and then that's how they do the complications\nBut when his ear oh you don't have to figure dance identified as much income\nAnd um when you invest your money with us if you want to let's say you can get a two hundred thousand dollars cash for you and you only need twenty five or fifty or whatever to pay our bills or whatever and you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of his daughter\nHe put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth finance no nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she did you get your house paid off of yo anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us we'll pay you six point two percent\nTax free even when you pull it out I mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine six percent compound of nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and I always liked science not tax deferred where you pay later as tax free\nNow if my home it's clear why would I Want to do reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you can run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house that and I'm a dollar Polly money buy a cup of coffee but what will let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part of the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever\nSo if you got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can loan you a hundred thousand now you've got a house they just gave you a hundred thousand dollars is just part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house and equity you've got a hundred thousand cash did anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that whole month every month at home gives enough that it doesn't send you a check then send you any money\nBut it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and gruesome painting and all kinds of expenses but it doesn't send you money I'm sure your way to how used part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let the cage drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call the eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping a cigarette and more I Want to know about it and I'll ask you this call of inquiry ask questions if you want to come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody's going to be something freighter just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMay not be all over that they all over the phone doing that and and I I really did examine this program before I got into it it has also it is a no brainer for folks that are needed a call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sections is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty ... every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and but my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who owned a house you own the house this year names on a date that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your Arizona house so I don't think it's somebody else's house just because you've got to reverse mortgages that's not true\nHow much of payments me they're going to be zero you don't ever make a payment and language said if you go to having a hard time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so it just made all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for and there's no reason in the world for each you being sixty tour over every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or a bank or whomever you're sending it to\nWhen I can erase it and give you a cash I mean\nI don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payments are acting racing in pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fence a mouse messed it up I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on TALK every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey MA and since the why you don't hear from a secretary on here for my sister anybody else you hear from ray Massey if you're not there you don't answer always leave a message\nAnd many times when it won't take a message out textures so I Do want to help as many people as I can see I mentioned the other day that right it's like a minister to you and I said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nSo that's that's what I Want you to do I want you to call a five to six six sixteen hundred\nBut at the money we can use it for anything you or you can pay off bills didn't help relatives\nYou can go to church you can do anything you want with it you're not limited some people say yeah you said but what can we do and we have to do this or that no you don't have to do anything with it you just put in our savings account her six point two percent tax free and it's tax free not tax deferred\nSo that they're just they didn't call they found five to six six sixteen hundred [noise]\nBut now we're in her seventies and we wanted a single story in a smaller pool so we moved to Katie and David we develop as a home and we're thrilled with it we're not leaving there to where you go to heaven\nAnd had no time was up there either so we have no payments for eternity and you can to\nUh so you actually can purchase a home what happens you just make a down payment\nWe finance their balance and then there's no payments on that balance average as long as you live there and it doesn't keep you from moving though let's say a month from now a year from now two years some circumstances come up you want to be in their grandkids or whatever you could sell sell the house he practiced sell it pay off your mortgage\nStill have plenty of equity they use that equity go by another home that is a reverse purchased for yeah so you just pay a damn pile of that one that has no payments again\nSo forget a sex is such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even if your homes clear and we'll get home clear for them and a little while because of their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call because I can give you money I'm part of your equity in that house has already cost me a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some cash\nSo anyway I'm On a\nPurchase kind of still events yesterday and Sylvester the savings account they called a lot of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify you know you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment and zero as opposed to that's getting a normal mortgage let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so some of those calculations don't have to be made when you're not going to have a payment since a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh\nWill call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred now let's talk about the people out there that have a clear how the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you can pull a deed out or the title to your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear if your car is clear and then be any good and just bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMaking some money for your retirement I mean they say you can get to know what the price of your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThan if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led and her six point two percent and then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes on that but you don't on the\nUh money for the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home ... you know that how homeless costs you money even though you don't make a personal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying insurance you're paying the homeowner's dues you sometimes by roofer fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into a savings let her six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some bills especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those are the ones who can go up to twenty thirty percent or higher goes but I go hide\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you uh have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes is that the mortgage is\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage could I just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment but you don't have that cash so if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement and that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust call me I I like to tell me one thing that this is a matter of how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government hundred percentage or you got it set up for seniors sixty to an older\nSo if you're under sixty three you don't qualify now when you get to be sixty two you can do that right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo don't keep making payments on your house and if you have a clear house great I'll give you some cash to help you and your retirement and they'll have to make payments on it ever again see real famous for life\nBut it doesn't restrict you from moving you can still move so you don't lose any of your options all I'm trying to make it easier and our golden years as they say to retire\nAnd so you had to make some income my wife and I play in the money we haven't we plan on one day saying hey start sending us about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's got to be great for us in our retirement we get that plus I have to Social Security checks and whatever else around and now we're set so I I'm just trying to get you said I'm just trying to get you interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent\nI'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you if you want to do it so don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't get angry\nIf you want to do it so don't be afraid that called me I don't buy it I I don't get angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision but if you don't make the phone call\nThat's your fault I mean I Can't make your dollar phone I don't even know who you are out there yet until you do call me so
