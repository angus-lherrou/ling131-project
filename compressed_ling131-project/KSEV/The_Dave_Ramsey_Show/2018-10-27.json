[noise]\nAre you guys have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marble it's wonderful and very exciting years and boy how has this year been and exciting one\nWith all the stuff that's been going on and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about what I Love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd uh we cherish them we value them we just enjoy the responsibility that we have to to help them with their finances to be there to guide\nAnd a recently ah the barons named him walk you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states [noise]\nYes and actually for the sixth year in a row and that again is all because of our clients so thank you guys I Hope those if you listen to show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about something that I think it's a very important and it's very important to us but\nI'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen is that um you know I think you're financially you'll be successful but I also think you'll be successful in life\nAnd so the same kind of things that it takes to have a successful business it's a successful financial adviser for him I think are the same sort of thing that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm going to apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this segment I'm entirely you are the most important person in the entire world\nSo as I mentioned in the previous segment I we we not work with the uh eight thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you got grandparents children grandchildren and in some cases great grandchildren it really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do indoor\nHow can we keep money matters and during\nA it would be irresponsible of of you know the ... with regard to our clients and and their families so we we have we called vision one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong are stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are what we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brings it doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do with your values\nSo in your family it it would be the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera this is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life\nAnd if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera\nSo this segment is you are the most important person in the world so we have to core values that applies that number two number for some core value number two says that our clients benefits before we do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless\nIf everything you do it geared around helping others\nThat what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works if this magic that happens it's sometimes called karma sometimes it's called the golden rule it it's ... it's what reaping and sewing I mean religions talk about it all the time\nWhat reaping and sewing I mean the religions talk about it all the time and if you focus entirely on ... those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had is because that's our philosophy that's how we live so that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meetings that we have with our senior financial ah partners are our senior partners where we talk about\nStrategy we talk about uh you know what we're going to do with given market conditions and all those kinds of things and in that meeting we had a chair it's an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we say is we want to always imagined that a client is sitting in that room with us while we're having this meeting\nAnd we always used that as our ... that client sitting in that room with us with day approve of what we're saying in this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we ... we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo this kind of goes to you know behave as if somebody's watching you all the time behaved as if what you're doing is is it's impacting others because we started looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming ... you close up and you close up\nOpening to all the opportunities that are out there for you core value number four says if a client called us we lost\nAnd what I mean by that is is that\nIf people rely on you ... you know you have to think of yourself as they're serving you know we feel like we work for everybody that you know I'm a CEO of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works at our firm\nI'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job to bet that they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we say if a client called us we lost what I mean by that is that if a client called about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or if there's something going on in the markets or anything that a client would call us about\nWe should be a head of that we should be pro active leaked communicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call it so therefore if a client called us we lost now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right they moved\nOr you know there's a change in their life or something happened those situations obviously a client called us we didn't lose but anything that we should have told them first we did live so in your life I think about people and uh how you run your business or if you're a if you work you know your boss your the people that are report up to you your peers\nGet them informed about what's going on don't ever let somebody call you and say hey what's going on with that when you told them you were on top of it keep them informed at all times and you'll get dumped peace of mind don't trust you and you'll be and I think you'll be happier in the process as well\nThat there is\nNo doubt okay now we are a financial advisory firm or not a a philosophical firmly do apply but we're what we preach uh and we would like to work with you if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon so this is you then that's who we\nWe\nSpecialize in working with so if you have questions about your pension plan do you take a pensioner a lump sum if you've inherited money if you're newly widowed or if you are retired uh or retiring soon you have all these financial changes that are happening in your life\nAnd uh if you'd like to talk to a professional to help you to make those decisions if you're about to get Social Security or you want to make a take it the right way you want to get income from your investments all those kinds of things that's what we do\nAnd I would like to work with you if if if we could so here's my offer if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on meat with an advisor if you do that you put your influence there will call you to schedule time to visit what we'll do is we'll sit down with you and we'll help you to build your entire financial plan from soup to nuts will take into account income taxes estate planning a path to

advantage of that go to our website money matters dot net All right we're going to take a break and when we come back we're going to talk about our noble obligation that we all have and I'll tell you what that is when we come back to his money matters and I and ...\nWith volatility in the market you may be asking yourself how will this affect my retirement savings will I Need to postpone retiring is there anything I can do to avoid\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about what are the love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nIn clients' we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nAnimals without our Milan but in most valued clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is it something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory firm die before you do that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be as strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines had a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do therefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with\nAre there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is a values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or the or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that injure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over the course of time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you would you built we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we called by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money you can invest in you know think of bitcoin for example okay some people invested in it pointed side go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down if you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last\nThen you could be down [laughter] you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually salad that's when you realize the value that you've created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is a value so therefore to protect our\nClients we have a by holding cell philosophy now aren't we have Ken core values and I want to share with you core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because the risk is not your friend\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend\nOkay people who take high risk you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they have the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan ... so what we tell us what we tell people in fact we say this at our seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible then here's what I recommend\nSell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turned it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcase full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red\nOkay we're big that now if we hit we're going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people but the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returns Vegas away but\nSomewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting at all on red lights how much risk you should take and\nOur goal philosophically in life and I think your goals in life should be the same thing and take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your goals\n\n[laughter] well I Love you back because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what it what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with Michael Douglas ... says greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way a spanking greedy people bottom bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a bad wounds you don't want that does not a pretty sight okay you don't want red red chicks so take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent interest that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk as it's necessary to accomplish hurdles\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I Want to tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors\nUm or you'd like to go to one of our seminars a I encourage you to do that I go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website and when you're there you can you can click on meat with an advisor if you do that at last

get onto your greedy and washed undeserving air all of that we'll talk about healthy to build your plan no charge no obligation and if we can help you fantastic and if we can't that's fine too\nNo

and this is what I'm the first one of course was a Social Security and then of course it's sixty five you get a Medicare and now you're sixty two you're older you get a reverse mortgage\nYou know we pay taxes on our um our lives and why wouldn't we want to cash in on something as grave as this reverse mortgage I Know my wife and I did\nAnd just get away from my sister and I've got a lot of close friends and and there's tons and tons of people that turned me on the radio or it's really exciting and society warning to get out um somebody referred to in almost like a ministry well\nIt's not as good as your true ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's a good ministry and to help people uh in common name when we're seniors and in our lives are all of them for next\nYear mayor sixty two years of age and if you're a married\nThen that person also needs to be sixty to her over so both of you must be sixty two her older and I get a lot of people call me every week and now saying well I'm Seventy five I was just the way you don't get the average it out [noise] you're both must be sixty two year old or so that's that's set in stone by the state of Texas [noise]\nUh okay who alone how that's another really really a misnomer out there everybody so the government owns your home mortgage company owned your own well heck if you have a ... a traditional mortgage and you pay ten or twenty or thirty percent down\nAlmost all the pets or valuable for adoption are fostering they may be seen on line\nAt county pets dot com adoptions must be made in person at the shelter at six twelve

or the iPhone app store with one click you are listening to a um seven hundred KFC the voice of Texas\nListened to the Danish head Saturday nights at eight and Sunday afternoon for right here on AM seven hundred Kathy the the voice taxing\n[noise]\n\nVery loud welcome back to the right mass ... show I'm writing math is really really side of the air and side of the\nSpread the news on the reverse mortgage uh I've just briefly ... what we mentioned in the first section to the federal government has established three wonderful programs for seniors and the first one was the Social Security a church and I don't see anybody for their those back I Know my wife and I know that's a wonderful program\nAnd then when you're sixty five you get Medicare\nBut when you're sixty two now you're you're eligible to do reverse mortgage on your home whether you owe money on your home or go no money on your home what they do they take a certain portion of the equity out of your home and they make a loan to you and the and you still have plenty of equity left us not alone\nSo I mean it's just a no brainer you might know payments you do have to be sixty two and if you're married you both have to be sixty to your payments to always be zero like I like to tell people my wife and I am zero payments for life has wherever reverse mortgages then when we get to heaven\nWe don't have any time was up there either so we got zero payments for eternity we have ... in our heart we loved him dearly and we've accepted as our savior and we're both going to heaven and now you can't do this to love Jesus and he'll love you right back I'll promise of that\nOr how much for your payments they zero forever I don't care how long you live\nOr what if I have a mortgage yeah if you have the right kind of equity which can pay your entire mortgage off and many times give you catch it in addition to that\nSo if you're a home but certainly or your home and your age it goes by home an agent of what the value of it home and how old you are a let's say you're qualified to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you've got to Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay\nQualified to two hundred thousand dollar loan and you got Seventy five thousand dollar mortgage they would pay off the Seventy five give you a hundred and twenty five cash hundred and twenty five thousand dollars cash plus about Seventy five thousand uh that helps you and your later years that helps you retire I mean it's it's an awesome program but\nI Can't make economy if you've got to do that part to get it started at least ask question I'm not saying policy I Want to do a mortgage I Want you to call in and choir\nSo you can get educated on it then once you understand it you'll do reverse mortgage 'cause it's a no brainer we pay taxes all of our lives and this is a program by the government a hundred percent insured by the U.S government\nAnd we're taking advantage of it\nAnd the money we gave me you can use it for anything you want\nIf you have a mortgage that's the one that really want to speak to any way I Want to raise all morning just for seniors if I can do it I Will but I Need you to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd if you want to purchase a home like my wife and I did\nYou can purchase a home and then you pay a certain amount down and we finance their balance I guess what your payment is zero for life not for five years ten years Twenty years fifty years till you pass away into both of you pass away if you're married\nSo you can purchase a house or you can do with a house that you have a ... a home you have a mortgage own our home that's clear that they don't do anything else will get to that part of it in a minute\nDo I need a lot of income and the answer is no you don't need a lot of income because\nYou're not going to have a payment when you normally when you apply for a loan for a home you say you got to have a thousand dollar a payment they build that into your or how much you make and how much expenses are and and then that's how they do ... patients but when you're ... you don't have to figure answer it doesn't take as much income\nAnd ah when you invest your money with us if you want to let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollars cash regalia and yelling need twenty five or fifty or whatever to pay our bills or whatever you want to invest their the hundred and fifty or all of his daughter\nHe put it right back into our savings account they call it a lot of credit growth ... nothing more than savings account that learning about six point two percent tax free and yes I'm saying tax free not tax deferred and it's tax free even when you take it out and use it\nSo here's what she can't get your house paid off of you know anything on it if you don't do anything on it you just take that money and invest part of it or all of it back with us we play your six point two percent tax free even when you pull it out\nI mean it's it's just a wonderful program that's what my wife and I did that setting it up for our our our retirement and we've got a quite a bit of money for us uh invested in it and more than six point nine and six percent compound of nothing so it's about seven percent\nTax free and our license not tax deferred where you pay later as tax free\nNow if my home it's clear why would I Want to do a reverse mortgage let's say you don't know a penny on your house\nWell that's great I mean you can run down the street and say hey I don't know anything on my house that and a daughter Holly money buy a cup of coffee but what will let us take part of that but not all of a just a small part in the equity out of your home and we give it to you in cash and you don't make a payment on it ever\nSo if you've got a two hundred thousand dollar house and we can learn to a hundred thousand now you've got a housing just gave you a hundred thousand dollars I Would just use part of your equity and you don't pay it back so you still have another hundred left in your house inequity you got a hundred thousand and cash did anything you want to put it in our savings account or six point two percent\nIsn't that better than just leaving all two hundred and into your home and that makes sense for that told and that whole month every month at home and gives you nothing it doesn't send you a check then send you any money but it does is it has taxes and insurance and homeowner's dues and new air conditioners and murders and painting and all kinds of expenses\nBut it doesn't send you money I'm sure your way to how he is part of the equity in your home\nTo help you uh have cash in and let the cash drop your like heck six point two percent go a guaranteed by the government tax free they'll show me where you can do that as far as I Know there's no other place\nSo this call that you know I keep saying if you want to take advantage of this program you have to do one thing you have to call eight five five\nTo six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred this has been in years past the best kept secret in the country on what's good for seniors\nAnd I'm here to tell you I'm not keeping it secret anymore I Want to know about it and all that should just call it Inquirer asks questions if you want to come to your home you can come to my home uh it doesn't matter it's free okay somebody offers something free to just to inquire that might send you a hundred or two hundred and three hundred thousand dollars\nMan I'd be all over that they all over the phone doing that and and I I really did examine this program before I got into it it is also there is a no brainer for folks that are needed to call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nSo just kind of briefly review what we've been talking about for the last two sessions is\nHow old are you have to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two older every week I get calls from people that are fifty fifty five and ... my husband or my wife Seventy or whatever it doesn't matter both of you have to be sixty two and a state of Texas\nNow who own the house you own the house it's your names on the day that you're home just like it'd be financing regular house you own the house and then when you pass away you get your heirs own the house so I don't think it's somebody else's house just because you did a reverse mortgage that's not true\nHow much pain to chat me they're going to be zero in on ever make a payment and language and you go to having a hunting time is up there either and so you have no payments for eternity so that we just need all love Jesus Christ and and that'll happen for all of us\nOkay what if I have a mortgage on my home and that's the people I'm really reaching out for there's no reason in the world for you being sixty two year old or every month right and that's crazy ... check to the mortgage company or banker who memory and sending it to\nWhen I can rent it and give you a cash I mean I don't understand that if somebody says right you can keep making that three thousand dollar payment or I can racing in pay zero meant I couldn't get the word that I'm a fence a mouth after that I Want that zero I don't want that three thousand dollar monthly payment anymore if there's a way for me to\nGet rid of it and I've got a way for you to get rid of it but it takes a phone call\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred and I promise you I call you back on every single call her back I don't care how many people call\nYou'll hear from ray Massey MA and says he why you don't hear from my secretary you won't hear from my sister anybody else you hear from ray man see if you're not there you know the answer always leave a message and many times when it will take a message out text you so I Do want to help as many people as I can\nSee I mentioned the other day that right that's like a ministry to you and I said yes it is in a way it is I'm helping people\nWill not take cash 'em a equity and my left in what I Do with the funds and the answer is no\nYou can put it up with us if you want to saving the cat will pay you about six point two percent tax free not tax deferred tax free or you can pay off bills are illegal Bennett anywhere you want to cheer money\nYou can just sheer money just do whatever you want as bad as plain as against some on when you get the cash and not limited\nUh what if I Want to purchase a home and that's what my wife and I did not tell everybody we were in that same house forty years in London that house when kids drank and everybody had more fun\nBut now we're in her seventies and we wanted a single story in a smaller pool so we moved to Katie and David we could build as the home and we're thrilled with it we're not leaving there until we go to heaven\nAnd had no payments up there either so we have no payments for eternity and you can to\nUh so you actually can purchase a home what happened just make a down payment\nRefinance the balance and then there's no payments on that balance ever as long as you live there and it doesn't keep you from moving though let's say a month from now a year from now two years some circumstances come up you want to be in their grandkids or whatever you can still sell the house she pays sell it pay off your mortgage\nPhilip plenty of equity they use that equity go by another home\nNone of the reverse purchased for you so you just pay a damn pile of that one that has those payments again\nSo forget a sex is such a great program I I just can't imagine not call and if you have a mortgage or even your homes clear and we'll get an al ... and a little while because their homes clear and it's just as important for you to call because I can give you money on part of your equity in that house has already cost me a lot of money so why why wouldn't you want some\nCash so anyway I'm On a\nPurchase kind of still a vast you as you can still live at the savings account they call it a lot of credit growth fund and earn about six point two percent tax free\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you don't need a lot of money to qualify because\nYour payment is zero ... as opposed to that's getting a normal Marge let's say your payments a thousand they got to add that to your other expenses and then how much you make and so it's a you know those calculations don't have to be made when you're not going to have a payment so it's a lot easier I I've gotten people in and make twelve hundred dollars a month\nSo anyway a few uh\nWill call me a five to six six sixteen hundred and now they're talking about the\nPeople out there that have a clear house the whole idea of getting a clearer home are clear car\nIs so you won't have payments it's not so you could polar deed out or the title of your car and run down and show all your neighbors your homes clear if your car it's clear and then do you any good and says bragging but I'm going to show us how to make that whole clear\nMake some money for your retirement I mean uh say you can get a I don't what price your home is that let's say you get a hundred or two hundred thousand cash reverse mortgage\nThat if you don't need it to pay our bills just invested with us led an earth six point two percent then one day and say hey start sending me a thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month towards my retirement and get that every month tax free\nYou know when you're getting Social Security check you still have to pay taxes all that but you don't on the uh money for the reverse mortgage even if it's interesting pull it out tax free and I don't ever say tax deferred you won't hear me say that it's tax free\nAnd so if you have a clear home ... you know that how homeless costs you money even though you don't make a personal interest payment you are paying taxes you're paying their churches are paying the homeowner's dues you sometimes by root for fixing air conditioner pain or whatever that the houses are expensive to oh\nSo why not take some of the equity out\nTake some of that cash and put it into a savings letter urge six point two percent tax free but set yourself up for retirement or if you have some bills especially credit cards I recommend everybody pay their credit card bills\nImmediately know use the money for anything else before you pay off your credit cards 'cause usually those are the ones that can go up to twenty thirty percent ... goes but I go hide\nAnd a lot more than they should but that's another story so if you have a clear home for goodness sakes calling me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred I'd probably do as many reverse mortgages for people that have clear homes as I Do mortgages\nNow I get the biggest kick out of helping people get out of the mortgage 'cause I just see their face saying oh I don't have to make a payment anymore\nWell when you're homeless Claire you already have that no payment but you don't have that cash\nSo if you can get another hundred or two hundred thousand cash to help you in retirement that can't be a bad thing that has to be a good thing but don't be stubborn and ... and say oh I I've heard bad things on on rivers mores will\nJust called me I I like to tell me one thing that this is a man how this would be a bad thing for you it's not it's a wonderful program that the federal government a hundred percent insurers\nYou got that set up for seniors sixty to an older so if you're under sixty three don't qualify now when you hit the beach sixty two you can but right now you have to be sixty to\nAn older if you're married both of you have to be sixty two\nSo they'll keep making payments on your house and if you have a clear house\nGreat I'll give you some cash that help you and your retirement and don't have to make payments on it ever again zero payments for life but it doesn't restrict you from moving you could still moving so you don't lose any of your options all and trying to make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire\nTry to do is make it easier in our golden years as they say to retire and so you had to make some income my wife and I play in the money we have and that we plan on one day saying hey starts and that's about three or four thousand a month\nAnd uh that's got to be great for us and our retirement we get that plus to Social Security checks and whatever else rare\nAnd uh we're ... so I'm just trying to get you said I just trying to get interested enough to make a phone call not to comments I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to understand the program a hundred percent I'm not selling it I'm explaining it and it's up to you if you want to do it\nSo don't be afraid to call me I don't buy it I I don't we're angry I just tell it like it is and then you make the final decision\nBut if you don't make the phone call that's your fault I mean I Can't make a dollar phone I don't even know who you are out there yet until you do comedy so it's up to you if you want to make life easier for you and your later years\nAll you have to do and you're the homeowner would it be a whole
