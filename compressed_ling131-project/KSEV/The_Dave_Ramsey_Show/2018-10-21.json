S. or India and China\n[noise] when you start working out of school I seen you know some students go look on or do what I Love they don't think about benefits that will think about retirement plans [noise] um it's really interesting\nHow little it's thought about that and how impactful it in when you retire someday for me if I talked to a young person living today I Would say hope you have a good retirement plan it's great if they have matching put in at least ten percent to start raising ... percent a year over five years you need to be at Fifteen Percent\nWhat you often can't gauge and you really can't ask the question until you get an offer\nIs what is the one I mean how many hours for people in their face time what is the culture and the work ethic\nSo in South Korea\nIt's not unusual to work sixty eight hours a week that's that's more than eleven hours a day six days a week\nBut we all know at some point there are diminishing returns\nSo now the and the government has come out there and said hey you can only were fifty two hours a week\nBut the culture is you never leave your desk until the boss has gone home even in that space time even if you're not getting things done even if you're you're just on the Internet and they're having a hard time to get people to reduce the fifty two hours a week so some companies\nAfter so many hours from the day they just turn off the power they just turn the power off\nSo I Know a utility company utility type company in Houston\nNow I I don't think I've ever seen a perfect credit score and Tony ... [laughter] well\nWho's [laughter] maybe it's because people you're dealing with [laughter] that may okay so what do you think the highest credit scores that you've seen\nI've seen like an eight forty before and that was pretty that was pretty good\nOkay and what's the worst\nOh I've seen them down in the labor force\nYou to work at a ... [laughter] you know you can start to three hundred sets really got to be bad if it's a and a three hundred four is not much better and even in the ... it's pretty bad\nWow um to get the best\nMortgage rate is in a seven forty what do you need\nTo feel yeah most all investors will will give you the ... Senate forty there's some investors that will get a little bit I'm at a rate if you had over a Saturn sixty five and trying to find that mainly on the gender line anything about any learning at about four fifty three one hundred\n[noise] sorry it was just fun and I think American Express was involved in it um actually it was a new consumer federation of America\nThey said that fifty seven percent of adults have check their credit score and the last year so there was a time that I never ever looked at my credit score unless I got a mortgage loan and then you would tell me what it was\nBut now I see it on my American Express I'd look on line to\nSee it I'm Amazed how much it kind of folks up and down\nSo\nMore people are checking in I pulled up numbers to see in there's a there's a million different credit scores out there though aren't there\nReally are and um you know they can vary and the south is kind of very I'm not the kind of D.C spouses pretty close to each other and laugh it's a new marriage where one person has has come out of a bad divorce or something like that you'll see 'em pretty close together on credit scores\nSo you know we could do a whole show on marriage you would like to be equally yoked financially equally yoked with your credit scores part of the fighting it's all equally yoked spiritually and um\nI guess I could talk about looks too but um yeah we'll just we'll\nTheir credit scores for today so about ten percent of your credit scores your credit mix so I mean a a a mortgage\nIs probably you know long steady more than like a credit card or short term that I Would assume the length of time so like I'm having American Express card for over twenty five years recent inquiries is ten percent the percentage of your\nRecent inquiries is ten percent the percentage of your credit that you use thirty percent of your credit score\nSo here's a question um somebody had ten thousand dollars available on their credit card is in their percentage that the credit reporting companies like to see you not using\nRight absolutely and we've heard and of course she talked to a different kind of expert at we've seen the most I get it started to ... percent you want to try to be thirty five percent below your credit line\nOkay and then that's a big deal and missed payments you you know you must pay me ... over what seven to ten years that ... percent of your score that's true absolutely\nBrilliant in some point every parent should sit down with children and say hey look this is one involving credit scores is really really important it's another reason you pay bills on time so you have here's what I Want to talk about just for a couple of minutes\nHow are you there are ways to make your credit score better fast in there\nThere are so when we pull our pre approving a client we will go in the first thing we do is we review the credit report we look to see where they currently are they've got a really high schooler we don't we don't mess with it if they've got a marginal score and we want to get to that next level up to get better pricing for that client\nWe will analyze the credit report and find um different\nWays to pay down the balance we have a a program that we run and analyze it and says hey if you apply five thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or a certain dollar amount what can you do to get this credit score\nUm improved and so it will give certain ideas most of the time it's paying down credit limits that's right the big one yeah then when it is getting an accurate information removed from the credit report\nSo those are the things that we look at and then once we do that it gets that credit score but only takes about three to five days to do that\nOne ... yes it's pretty quick when she provided that documentation the other thing is that it it\nCosts about thirty five dollars a trade line says you as a consumer will have three trade lines when you're working with a mortgage company because they'd pull through all through various\n'cause we have for the metal door for trade line is each credit bureau\nThat threat okay and said there's there's a total of six that for improving six that can get pretty costly\nSo it's just one thing to keep in mind you want to make sure that um you keep those balances led because I don't keep your credit scores higher you always check your report for an inaccurate information and do not close account closed count 'em do not increase your FICA score it hurts it in some cases\n[noise] so when I went to get life insurance I lost twenty five pounds he got super fit for using the same logic you'd want to have things paid off do you think you're getting ready to read a mortgage rubber gloves\nI think so I agree\nEntirely agree if I got life insurance in a more he's at the same time I would be then that's it and financially responsible [laughter] that's right\nSo let's make its variants you've seen it in a married couple were like one was a rock star financially and one was it\nOh yeah I can be drastic sometimes [laughter]\nNames of couples you've worked with no drugs [laughter]\nSo okay here's a here's an interesting question if you you had couples in what has a great credit score and one done is usually the man that has a bad score or the lady that has bad score you know I'm just going to use couples for the purpose of that show in those little sense okay\nWell you know it's funny it's different you know what I find the one that usually pays the bills easily has the lower credit score and it's weird or the one that has the most debt in her name has the lower credit score than a than a spouse okay I think it's more the way it is on then that's what I what I typically see\nSo when I when I got married I wasn't worried about credit scores much but my wife went to a Baptist church I wanted to see if she was you know pledging to building program right\n[laughter] when\nMy daughter started dating guys to get married I'm thinking hey how much do we have in student loans\n[laughter] yeah I Do see a lot of student loans [laughter]\nOh my God I Know I Know a family who is um wealthy\nIn their son married a girl who was a school teacher and she had eighty thousand dollars in student loans\nAnd so the family and they love the girl they're all about the girl with the family had a pretty it's still having a pretty intense discussion this is our daughter in law do we pay off her student loans and they're going\nOkay well if we pay him off the Murray's last we assume it'll last [laughter] at least some do regard showing paid off immediately should we say hey you should teach school for three years and getting paid off we pay them off sooner will have babies sooner\nI mean it was like they came down to my office and sit down at my round table and wanted to have a whole discussion about we love our daughter in law she's amazing but we just found out right before the wedding to eighty thousand student loans\n[laughter] you know I sure didn't I mean yeah I can I can\nTalk through things I Can't tell someone what to do I do families would pay it off in a heartbeat if they could do families that could and they're like heck no I'm about to move on that let them work it out\nYeah reason I thought I Will tell you this clicks story I had a thousand dollar credit card balance when I was getting married my husband said you're going to have to get rid of that debt before we get married and I was like okay and I and I got rid of it\nAnd come to find out a month after being married I added him to my insurance because I had this great family discount yadda yadda yadda\nAnd months after we were married a in a State Farm I sent me a letter saying that they were going to cancel our insurance policy because of his driving habits\n[laughter] I quickly\nReversed it on him [laughter] so let me go get his own insurance he wasn't going to ruin my discount [laughter]\nThat's funny so your husband was talking about credit card a little bit you know the speed racer\nExactly had his own financial issues [laughter]\nI had someone in my office this week I Believe there was a State Farm and um they have a large house they pay them and they have one car in the car was in the hundred dollars a year\nSo they checked around and found out they can ensure the car for a thousand\nIf you want online monitoring artificial intelligence the whole bit he can be about a hundred thousand bucks a year for everything electronic we could also do it for a minimal minimal cost\nIf you haven't checked all the new cool things available again they're getting less intrusive less hardware more wireless more things you can do on your phone it's really amazing everything we can be done artificial intelligence is coming into it also ... no big deal less expensive\nProbably could thing to check out\nI should have asked Kelly about this one I had her on a few minutes ago but I Know she's in the ... and they have rules and regulations and you know a lot of these neighborhoods\nHave tight guidelines right that's how you keep the quality of the neighborhood [noise] floors more Illinois in Nineteen Seventy five\nWas by a country club near Chicago things are going on and they basically said no pickup trucks in our community that less there in the garage\nThey'll pick up trucks you can't park and pick up\nUnless it's in the garage but I find you fifty bucks so they gave out a hundred and twenty seven truck tickets last year so\nIf you live there and you have a big trucks off it in your garage you get a ticket you have to park in the church will some people have been suing them and then as you know the best selling vehicle in America has been the Ford F. one fifty it's been that way for years but here's a community where you just can't park trucks\nDoes that seem kind of crazy [noise] it is interesting\nThey probably did that saying look if you're driving a trade truck and your name's on it with what your equipment in the driveway at night some people are suing the drivers of America's favorite vehicle Kim Parker wheels outdoors buy homes enforce more Illinois now there are\nCommunities in neighborhoods here in Houston that you can't leave a car on the street overnight so in my wife and I first got married we lived in South side place who vote a small cottage and self I place um [noise] and you couldn't park the car on the street overnight and if you\nIf you're in a lot of neighbors or I'm Sorry if you have a lot of out of town against and you looked across the street you call the police department tell them they they probably wouldn't give me a ticket but they just try to do that to say hey cuts down on crime you know everything should be in the driveway of a strange cars in your driveway you're probably going to know\nBut the nice neighborhoods ... have more of those regulations even though can drive you crazy on occasion I got in trouble once my wife had a home in ... park\nI bought a John Deere tractor and you know being kind of the city guy with his first tractor before I took it to the farm I wanted to wash it and ... and paid a few parts I lifted my driver or a few days\nAgo park on to me they're like Hey Steve tractors can't park those new driveway hey let's talk about interest rates and this is really interesting every day to select group the Federal Reserve officials get together and try to guess worthy short term interest rates are going to get federal funds\nRecently they think that by the end of twenty twenty which is two and a half years short term rates you'd be three point four percent which means veer passions savings you get higher interest\nRate on it and it also means are going to be paying more for a mortgage or a new car loans are the things that go with it\nSo survey was done other group of people who are searching for credit card\nAnd folks looking for a credit card weren't really worried about the interest on the credit card because they said they'd pay it off every month\nThey were fooling themselves most people don't pay it off every month the average credit card debt today is sixteen point eight percent in fact one major bank ads from almost twelve to twenty percent to the prime rate\nSo literally I Know one big bang today has credit card interest rate is twenty nine point nine nine percent so if you're among the people that are shopping for cars and you're thinking of all pay it off to worry about it\nYou need to really look at yourself and go do I pay it off one out of\nThree credit cards carried by consumers has no balance to edit three have a balance\nNow uh concerning thing in general is the economy's good people are making money people were paying taxes what our government's going into more and more debt so you're supposed to save money in good times and then use that money in bad times if you spend all your money in good\nTimes and things get bad you're really not in a good place\nHousehold how they're handling it well we're having good times his household debt going down new household debt his record Thirteen point two trillion dollars in the most recent quarter\nHousehold that services now bigger percentage or one of the largest percentage as it's been in recent times to pay back that debt\nSo it's good times I Want to remind you and I've done this a lot lately don't expand by the big mansion and more cars in good times you want to hunker down do a good job\nIn a more cars in good times you want to hunker down do a good job save your money our government's not what it means I'm really not sure but rates are going to go up there will be stressed at some point\nAnd that was a great time to get ahead financially [noise]\nTraditionally cities have not been in favor of some one building a\nReally small house for the tiny house movement going on across our country and if you turn on cable TV you'll see people building these tiny houses often they're like two hundred square feet but with I I think there's a couple of aspects of this tiny house thing some people\nJust look at the cost of the house and the utilities in the insurance and the upkeep and everything that goes with it and they're like I'm never going to get there\nA tiny house all it's tiny give some hope it's something that can really get paid for well so\nCities across the country have always been against tiny houses look it's too little to look good but\nWhat Texas City is now welcoming tiny houses I Know you're gonna find a shock you don't give you a hit cities across the country working you would include Boulder, Colorado Los Angeles in Portland, Oregon what Texas City would be most like those\nUsa cities will in Austin, Texas so I have a friend that built the tiny house and it's like the coolest thing I'm not sure I could live in one\nThere's some people who will take your house on wheels and they just moved around\nSo tiny houses are big they're [laughter] they're popular up big and they're getting more common they're coming into some cities I Know a few people living tiny houses and they really simplified their life financially\n[noise] I've
