game tomorrow afternoon at two thirty\nRight here in our backyard a TV the stadium\nCould really get a win here there'll be in the top twenty five\nI can guarantee you that and I'm going to guarantee a cougar went to I I like the good reason that game Derek King has been playing great football quarterback for the University of Houston\nIf the cougars will get off to a fast stars and keep the pedal to the metal I think they'll be the undefeated South Florida bulls as the twenty twenty it's ranked bowls come into Houston\nThis weekend for a showdown or that's I Believe the game but either on ESPN two or ABC kickoff set for two thirty\nThe bulls seven at oh\nHaven't blown away their opponents this season and both the team coming in as one of the three teams in conference play that are still undefeated\nOr the bulls who are in the east cougars in the west or do they big conference game for both of them I think more so for the cougars the bulls who will still get their matchup of central Florida even at South Florida loses this game they will still control their own destiny in the ... in the eastern division\nIf they were to win out run the table the rest of the way within the American athletic conference for the cougars this would just be a huge win\nTo stay on beating in the west to help keep their chances alive and controlling their own destiny to get to the conference

James game Texas obviously in the driver's seat or at four no er and for Texas\nThey could've they Texas can actually lose the game and still control their own destiny\nOr having beaten Oklahoma\nAlready on the schedule and you look at all the other one last teams that are behind them that that could potentially a challenge the University of Texas they if you have to play him\nOr they haven't played West Virginia yet they haven't played Texas Tech yet\nSo if say a melon gr is unable to go\nA albeit\nAll indications are that he was a full participant in practice this week and looks like Ellen gr is going to be ready to start for the Texas Longhorns but if he wants to come out and have a bad game they happen to subdue totally gets Oklahoma State was and they still get West Virginia at home and then the real game against that sticks to control their own destiny in the big twelve conference\nAnd even losing a game it would be big for them to win at Oklahoma states and then if they split ... those two games against West Virginia and Texas Tech are they still have the leg up on you because they would have beaten and head to head\nWhich essentially could possibly knock you out of it\nBecause do you still have to go to Morgantown at the end of the year and they still have to play the red writers\nAnd the red writers are there are still very much alive as well\nOr even though they lost to West Virginia forty two thirty four\nThey still both get OU and Texas at home and logic\nAnd if they are able they were able to get those two wins I Would have the

we came to these conclusions yesterday these these devices were meant for one reason to influence the midterm elections in which way we don't know\nBut I think this is the reason why Americans of all political stripes whether you're a liberal or conservative Democrat or Republican they see what this is this is an attempt to influence the election and it's driving everybody to their corners\nIf you were anti Trump before you're anti Trump now these scares didn't change your mind same thing if you were a pro Trump or pro Republican or trying to stop Democrats you didn't have your mind changed by any of this so its mission failed in that regard\nLast twenty four hours it doesn't matter who did this I Would love him to be caught or her I Would love them to pay the price\nBut the point is that the ... the burden is on the president potential he has a higher responsibility and Nancy Pelosi or any of these people have to say this is incredibly dangerous anyhow trickle down blaming the media is not good enough okay\nFor a job he did say all of those things and you just admitted it in the beginning of your cell by\nAll because it was prepared by somebody else and put in the teleprompter okay fine but he said and he said it I thought it was rather forcefully\nSo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct just investigation and bring those responsible for these

unify ripped to come together\nThat's what he's been saying since he won election it's like the election's over let's unify what's become Americans and then we'll we'll save the political battles for the next election but the lesson never let it go ab with all due respect I Love you to death I really do\nBut to ignore two years of\nViolence two years of division of rhetoric two years of ... well you know who said it more ... than I Am because I take a long time to explain this in the last couple of days I've been outlining for all of you\nKnow the the\nDuration of the left the DVD and see how the left the violence of the left in this country since the election Donald Trump hack on his inauguration they burned down Washington\nVandalized buildings burned up cars marched on Washington

not just assuming that the perpetrator is probably all over the writer Trump supporter about the widespread functioning most of the media coverage that you've seen\nThe president is responsible so we've gone beyond even joke we don't know who did this we have no idea what they're real motivation was or what their purpose was to really Trump is somehow directly responsible for this as an incitement they're not saying that he built a bomb he obviously didn't have\nThe glass shards at home and that was constructed thing on his own well they are saying the robbers fortunately there were CNN covering for the other approaches Trump's hit list their car and those are the president wasn't taking personal responsibility for this\n... ... I got to explain that you guys you know the wording that is on the bottom of the TV screen they call it a tire on our CGI Cairo on graphic\nAnd buck was right CNN in the most stunning display of journalistic irresponsibility tried tried to say that all of these people who allegedly were targets of these whatever these devices were\nThat these individuals were part of Donald Trump's hit list a ... a show called journalist who was a fake journalist from fake news CNN actually wrote\nThose ... those words on a screen as if there was some sort of hit list as if the individual doing all this was was acting at the behest of the president it's complete your responsibility as juvenile whoever wrote those Cairo on graphics is a child\nAnd that is people climbing up the president has a direct positive effect on this\nAnd in this overall climate I'm Sorry but there isn't a quality here in terms of how much modeling the behavior and crazy rhetoric is coming from both sides of the president's fights back and that means the president sometimes really goes further than most people including support along ... miles on Capitol Hill mom's on the streets anti fall on both coasts\nPeople who are

danger they were never never never in any danger from these devices and we don't even know the devices were actually made to go off yet\nThat has not been determined but Wolf Blitzer wanting to push Chris Cuomo's silly inane biased talking points again he's not a journalist he's putting out talking points for left wing or Z on CNN CNN says we're news\nEtcetera BS Wolf Blitzer is not a journalist Wolf Blitzer gets faced\nWith a ... a Democrat parties and it's been caught on video doing so having wine yucky it up he loved him he's a Democrat he's a liberal\nAnd his line of questioning reveals his bias\nDo you believe the president should at least the courtesy to call the former president's Bill Clinton or Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and others and just as a courtesy tell them we're working on this because I'm sure you're the security will be so I\nI just took me to mention their names let alone picked up the phone and giving them a call that sounds exactly like\nCuomo doesn't it doesn't even mention that we really do drugs that are left as Democrats are are beautiful ... ... ... ...\nA\nWolf where were you\nWhen rice and was being sent to the president of the United states Donald Trump or you this concerned over his safety\nAs a matter of fact you weren't\nHe's talking to congressman or Chris Stewart and the congressman really in a very calm very measured response told wolf\nVery measured response told Wolf Blitzer that\nHis bias was showing\nWill if I just I mean I I honestly have no idea what the protocol would be on something that wasn't going to be professional courtesy would be I mean\nI I'm sure the bill Clinton and those of they're working on this I'm sure Secretary Clinton does when President Obama I'm sure that they know that he's concerned about this I suppose a phone call would it be a cruise thing to do but\nI I don't think it's I don't know that I'm willing citizen condemned the president because he has said their names specifically it seems to me that's maybe stretching to find something to criticize him for when there was much more important issues we could talk about regarding this\nHall yeah isn't that the definition of CNN kids stretching to find something to criticized Trump or anything to criticize Trump about CNN op tells Congressman Chris Stewart\nThat Trump is going after them Wolf Blitzer very concerned that the president's going after them because they believe they should be able to do as much unfair coverage without being called out by the person they're attacking\nOr not for congressman or with all due respect for president disagrees with you because he repeatedly says we the news media the mainstream news media are recalls fake news we deliberately go rock their hosts false information and I can assure you if we do get it wrong and a journalism and the first round of history if we make a mistake we try to correct it\nWe've yet she has nothing to do with that you're one of your first questions to the congressman demonstrated enough that you weren't necessarily wrong wolf\nThat's that's not the issue\nThe issue is that you chose a question that was a stretch in an effort to paint the president and the most negative light you possibly could that indicates your political bias in in a news operation you're not supposed to have it that's all\nNow where you are wrong by saying that Donald Trump didn't call up President Clinton well know where you are wrong when you said that Donald Trump didn't call up President Obama well no you weren't wrong\nBut how is it material to the conversation how does it how does it have a tankers darn bit of difference on catching the individual who perpetrated this\nIt is it you're you're focusing on something that you can criticize the president for instead of maybe I don't know running as soundbites like we have done and saying well the president said the right thing now is focused on catching the guy or guys or gals whoever's responsible for this\n[noise]\nThe way one\nFive I think I have a three way one five I can see me coming up at eight Fifteen [noise]\nGovernor Greg Abbott will be here folks will be talking to them

last one of those places man [laughter] you know I was a great deal of interest to shot couple shots you know and yeah there are years away\nBut why don't you don't want since this we're bringing up the movies and says we're bringing up Jack Nicholson ties I mean let's let's if let's say share you remember share from Sonny and Cher what if what if what if she confronted a Wolf Blitzer across Cuomo what my ... I see [noise]\nYou know I I Am positive that you are the most unattractive man I have ever met in my entire life you know in a short time we've been together you have demonstrated Murray low some characteristic of the male personality and even discovered or if you knew when\nYou are physically repulsive intellectually retarded morally reprehensible longer insensitive selfish stupid you know take a lousy sense of humor and you smell\n... you're not even interesting enough to make me think\nSo I think I think that is that is in a nutshell CNN right there [laughter] to search for liberty brother got a search for the liberty on a friday thank you\n[laughter] get searched for liberty [laughter] got to search\nFor the liberty on a friday the baggage appreciate the call I appreciate your wedding welcome to grow cells say they'll show morning\nBefore I make my comment [laughter] remember when the Steve police\nShot and the coach for the end of ... and you know a firearm banned by the left you remember when that happened a couple yeah I Do remember that\nNo actually the left never called for the banning of firearms when Steve squeeze was shot\nWell no I actually some did I mean some use it as an excuse to go after I I remember ... yeah I'm In Atlanta and that's not\nEnough but anyway here's my theory yeah well first of all the ... this is that you can as I said yesterday you can smell the expiration right have you heard a member of member limber liver the anti gun boy you know James Hog with or whatever that losers name is who's\nBeen in a in a ... David hog I Believe yeah yeah no cake was okay\nThis this whole thing looks really amateurish and it was it was meant to be I mean these these bombs were going to go I mean they had time or something that weren't working and this is a joke on well\nHow do you how do you put a timer on a bomb and send it to the male ... and ... I reliably hit its target I don't you know\nIn in ... and look people aren't phones which was funny that this is a good um ten miles away from this post office in in Florida where some of the stuff is going to happen right give gifts when high schools in that location\nAre you going to say Parkland a member of a do not be surprised well\nUh [laughter] you know I've seen a couple of means on on a Facebook that that show a David hog the um he and his Mary band of gun grabbers you just said they didn't receive a and a legend bomb [laughter]\nI I used to make them relevant once again in ... in New I hear\nI hear show jackass leaf screaming racism because she didn't get one ... of them\nYet while you know Maxine Waters got one so she can't credibly get out there and say that so I Would get thank you very much for the call them and I appreciate it to a one five I made by seven three eight to eight one five I made KFC being able to talk about the horde folks out a horde as you well know\nOr between seven thousand and fourteen thousand strong we have it confirmed that there are bad elements method infiltrated the horde and the president of the United states has committed us resources to stopping the horde here is the president\nYou after some very very bad for him the caravan us some very governmental elements within the ... of it\nBut I Will seal off the border before they come and gone bring out our military not our reserves and bring out our military\nNow I was watching Fox News yesterday Julian Turner who I think gives up\nWho tries very hard to uh play it straight down the middle not necessarily a Trump fan but not necessarily a Trump to tractor either chili and Turner says that the president doesn't have the authority to ... to close the border without Congress\nNow\nI don't know if that is true it all depends\nOn who you ask now closing down the border and stopping the horde two different things\nOr\nYou can conceivably stop the horde while keeping the border the ports of entry open now this is problematic because if you keep the borders open the hoard all the other day was dispersed and bum rushed the border\nOver several miles and try their luck\nAnd that that to me is a security risk and the fact that Congress will not sign off on it and Chilean Turner said it's not likely that Congress will allow the shutting down on the border\nSo then we'll know who to blame come election day but that that this is what this is why I Believe\nThat the first toward has been diverted to California because it\nAdds time onto their journey and\nIt will necessitate their arrival after the election so when you when I see the government the Congress not acting and primarily will be Democrats standing in the way\nWe won't be able to take it out on them at the ballot box okay so you've got the\nPresident saying that well he's going to stop and he's gonna shut down the border you got Julian Turner and some people saying that the president doesn't have the legal authority to shut down the border but you've got conservative review\nSaying President Trump has full constitutional power to stop the border invasion even without Congress Daniel Horowitz riding nets\nAre just as President Reagan's uh Reagan is remembered for ending the Cold War President Trump can be remembered as the one to end the war on our sovereignty\nWill he rise to the occasion here is a stone cold truth about our border we could construct a border wall as high as the stratosphere and it won't help much if we continue our self destructing policies of allowing bogus\nOr a St Louis to come through our front door and legitimizing the opinions of sanctuary judges who make then dozens of aliens\nPresident Trump publicly warned the government's among Buddhists El Salvador and want them all up and that if they don't take steps to stop the latest caravan of bogus asylum invaders he will cut off aid to those countries while this is a good first step\nIt won't deter the invasion unless unless\nWe stop the invasion itself stop the admission of the invaders and implementing and stop implementing catch and release under orders from illegitimate court rulings as we did in the previous caravan and countless tens of thousands of others coming with less pomp\nAnd and that would hold true even if the the border had a wall on it they just come to our points of entry surrender themselves get released into our communities\nAnd never show up for their hearings until and unless they wind up committing crimes\nMore over the caravan is already in the ... the head and through Mexico out of the ... the head of or Mexico that's the Honduran diplomacy is moot at this point\nAnd this is much bigger than the care of and we must first dissect what is actually happening at our borders and then they go through all this then they make the legal case about Donald Trump\nWhy good morning how are you sir doing well thank you why hurt my opponent's name mentioned and ah so I thought I'd call in a ... another chance for your audience is aware of me\nWell why don't you make me aware of you who are you sir\nI'm Phil Kurtz on the libertarian candidate running against Al Green in a a four way race which actually has three liberals and the libertarian and no Republican\nWow wow really really and you know I\n... that that's an interesting dynamic at one might think that Mr green is trying to stack field split the votes so we can get the plurality that's when it sounds like to me\nWell one of the candidates are Kesha Rogers actually ran a twice against Pete Olson and lost got the nomination for Democrats around and then last time ran for Senate nomination in the Democratic party a in a in a ... foot because she was not an old ... Obama fan so she was\nA warning and having him impeached and wanting them to do and you're a Democrat and looking at her nomination yeah so they're kind of get\nOut of the party so she's running it she's a La Russa Democrat and so she is running as an independent\nAnd then\nJohn Young man named brand Hernandez who's been out to him and services actually I'm not max is actually a good guy he was brought here as a a\nA illegal or one up to the age of Fifteen but his parents when they got citizenship he's been working for the city of Houston and health services are handing out or the health benefits and things like that for years and decide that you would take Iran\nUm nice guy very liberal very soon going to hire you know that\nWe'll wait a minute ... more liberal than al ... Al Green and not only is he a liberal but he's crazy I'm In the man is literally\nI mean he he now says ... and of course Mr green as well come on this program anytime he wants\nTo come on here and and and to make me on that but I mean this man has filed articles of impeachment against the president of the United states and many Americans are going what for ah for violating what we're doing now I understand that impeachment is is a\nPolitical exercise more than it is a legal exercise and nobody nobody doubts the left wing political desire to remove ineffective Republican president but still I mean going to this well every single time you get somebody in office you don't like I just think the American people get tired of it yeah I Know where are you on impeachment Phil\nWell when you look at 'em there's absolutely no evidence available\nFor impeachment and they and and what actually points that out is he actually came a Mr green came out and made a statement that well he doesn't really need to break the law for us to impeach him when he clearly the constitution yes actually says yes he does\nAnd Pete high crime and fully yeah high crimes and misdemeanors yes but I'm ... now you're you're a libertarian or why are you a libertarian\nWell since two thousand and six thirty four people or options or something like ... first time running on a national\nAbout but um I wanted to give people an option other than to the parties and I'm always a lot of young people that are running uncontested you know a sad\nThing right now Chris is there are thirty five seats in the U.S house of representatives better suited but Democrats that are going on contested and twenty nine Republican seats that are going uncontested ... which is Fifteen Percent of our direct representations with the U.S house of representatives\nThat nobody's nobody's going against these guys are in an election and people are screaming in a one term limits but right now it is people are just not stepping up and and getting into the getting into the fray\nNailing the libertarian since I got here let me ask you a couple of questions I'm sure so I Am a conservative\nI'm not a Republican I Am a conservative where do you when I disagree what policy does that does you knew he was a ... I'm always fascinated by our libertarian cousins or where do you when I I as a conservative and you as a libertarian where do we disagree\nWell it's interesting you say that because I'm actually on the conservative side of libertarianism\nPaul I'm pro life candidate uh-huh I'm\nPro liberty which means removing unnecessary law things like the state of New York likes to tell you what size Saudi or couldn't buy in California like tell you what kinds of straw you can suck it through in North Canton in in ... that would be funny except for its real right so they're real laws now\nSo the government overreach treated as you stay in the pro liberty stands up were very much about contradiction one of the places we probably differ with Republicans is the use of a of money or an especially recordings of the military\nThe military and you know I don't I'm not I'm not viewing the\nMilitary as a as a couple of years of the defense of says situation there was just saying we like to say I like our military to be a fireman not police\nGod's that I Know that that's not bad I I just see my my my view on the military is it needs to be the biggest ... uh most technologically advanced force on the planet so that nobody even thinks about challenging it never happened we ever use it\nA in an offensive manner ... not offensive off in some manner but the fact that it is a wonderful deterrent to have such a capable well trained force that uh you can avoid war it's the peace through strength mentality that was it was pushed by what am I ...\nWar it's the peace through strength mentality that was it was pushed by one of my favorite conservatives are Ronald Reagan ah where are you on any because I Am starting to warm to the idea of medical\nMarijuana and not just the time just smoke but the kind that you ingest as a way to help cat cancer patients as a way to help those who are dealing with a unbearable pain where are you on that\nWell for the regulation of marijuana one of the I'm a straight a lot of people just don't understand as we've already do have medical marijuana ear you're tractors for epilepsy mhm so do you sort of ... and then of course there is like a community oil and things like that\nYeah that that's what I favor I ... the smoking stuff I I don't I don't like the recreational marijuana aspect of it because I I think there were medicinal qualities that are legitimate\nFor uh uh the the female side of the marijuana plant on the male ... hemp hemp side is up a wonderful fabric and and uh a very useful a fabric so that that is one area that I as a conservative I'll find myself agreeing more and more with our a libertarian\nFriends fill Iowa who she ate you appreciate your calling look I I have to offer that was four and a half minutes we spent

intricate\nAnd replacing our current opioids which are highly addictive and very dangerous and it led to the crisis in this country that that maybe the THC line of drugs in it as you heard and that that by the way for those of you don't know that was a liberal Greg\nWho called in yesterday we had to knock down drag out but what you heard what you witnessed on this program your moments ago was a rare moment of agreement from two different sides of the political spectrum because and I think this is what we're missing in the country\nI mean Greg and I found a a unifying principle behind a common humanity because we all end your pain from you know aging bumps bruises that kind of thing\nUh but uh what\nI think the country had to be after is more unification ... around being Americans about some simple American principles and maybe if we can start focusing on those common American principles that we can find at least the ability to agree to disagree once again in this country without having to resort to fisticuffs or\nOr violence or what we've seen in the streets over the last couple of years I've got to get this out you folks on hold hang on I'm going to get to your calls you're in second before we get Governor Greg Abbott on\nI is coming up at a a quarter after so Russell make sure we get out to vote to accommodate our spot load and get out on time here but I wanted to bring up the conservative reviews\nEvaluation of Donald Trump's ability to close down the border and go after the horde and prevent them from coming into the United states\nAh inherent executive authority walk Congress writes conservative view about Congress controls immigration wants immigrants are legally admitted to our country and can also exclude anyone from a mission precedent shares concurrent jurisdiction on exclusions\nThe president can deport anyone he wants to without any authorizing statute it doesn't matter he can exclude anybody from coming into the country up front as the Supreme Court\nIt's glued anybody from coming into the country up front as the Supreme Court said in a landmark Nineteen fifties cage quote\nThe exclusion of aliens is a fundamental active sovereignty\nThe rights to do so stems not alone from the legislative power but as inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation and this is why our first one hundred years of the country immigration was entirely controlled by diplomatic correspondence through the state department\nThe president was clearly using this authority when communicating with the leader of a country of origin of this of this\nCaravan slash hoard\nSo even though Julian Turner may have been splitting hairs and when she said the president doesn't have the authority to shut down the border meaning closed it down completely shut down the commerce and all of that without the authority of Congress he does have the authority\nTo say are you folks from Honduras you folks from what the model you folks from El Salvador you are excluded from coming into the United states\nUntil the Congress does when it's supposed to do and does this work and reforms the law so that you just can't show up and say the magic word asylum and disappear into our country this was brought up on Fox and friends It's MORNING my friends\nThis is the ... are talking with Steve duty\nEverything's on the table the White House and saying they couldn't use an executive order much action to twelve of the rich and that's where the president would declare some migrants email a jumble for asylum because it would be contrary to national interests\nTo this caravan this coming into Texas remember this and that is\nThese images on TV and things like that these are are not people seem to beef up the typical or category people who are trying to seek asylum trying to escape or a country or this causing them harm because they had been actually hearing the flag\nOf the country they they are playing yeah so\nThis is ... and remember this also matters if if if this ... many thousand people are allowed across our border there'll be another twenty five thousand or coming after them and then another fifty thousand after them and so that the president was emphatic\nThat we have sovereignty in this country or that must be respected and he he was going to do whatever it takes to make sure that ... there's going to be upheld and almost say that we made clear that we stand ready to assist the president in any way whatsoever\nYou're probably already know about this charge to be a National Guard to the border and got them down on the border for a long time now and we will continue that\nAh but what we have several other strategies that we're working on as we speak\nOr to make sure that the state is working in collaboration with the federal government to make sure that this caravan is not going to be coming across the border into being into the United states\nAs Texas citizens first line of defense or how essential is it to you to have a finally have a partner in the White House and the tanks our national security seriously as as you do\nIt for one is essential for their safety and security of the United states but secondly as it was great to have somebody we can work with [laughter] you know a A R battled constantly against your minister ration or because they actually are promoted open borders\nAnd this is one of the great divide that we haven't discovered in ... and this was one thing that causes so much and thanks among our voters and that is you have people here in Texas but people in other states where they're frustrated and angry that our borders are open I got to tell you I was on the border yesterday and I was talking with\nElected officials are present or and they were very concerned and they were asking for state resources to help them deal with the costs of low people coming across the board of this was something it doesn't matter what your race or background or region is everybody in this state and I believe increasingly in this country\nI Want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect our sovereignty or you know and then somebody other people across the river was up in order to get out of the votes were across the state I was a built in\nTexas a couple of days ago when a woman came up to me\nAnd she says she was a recent immigrants from Peru and now she's very angry because she's or is that these policies of Oakland border policies are messing things up and destroying the American dream that she became a citizen or she says she did it the right way and now was being\nPushed is destroying the right way to to come here in ... here at a crucial to the American dream here\nI I couldn't agree more or less shot by the way Governor Greg Abbott our gas right now folks governor let's let's turn to politics if we can as you mentioned your on your on a statewide tour right now I'm getting out the vote on\nThis is no surprise to me because I remember ... your last election where you received fifty four percent of the male Latino vote but this [laughter] this story just kind of made me ... a little a little bit because your your opponent or somebody I called ... Valdez a movie about as a ... was ...\nAnd uh somebody I called ... Valdez a little movie Valdez you was rumored to be a law enforcement officer at one time when she wasn't losing a firearm\nA and losing track of her firearm just yesterday you received the endorsement of the national Latino law enforcement organization can you speak to what that means to use her\nAll the news a lot to me first because of law enforcement our respective revere and support\nOr law enforcement officers and we are as is elected officials and we as people need to support\nOr law enforcement officers as opposed to attacking them for simply doing their jobs but secondly ah I'm very very proud to have the support of the Latino community because as you point out that I received ... this past weekend\nI received the endorsement of the organization of Spanish speaking officers over in Houston, Texas and this was happening across the state of Texas because it doesn't matter if you're Latino or not like you know\nOr they want a governor who is going to be supporting law enforcement as opposed to being antagonistic to law enforcement and also I think they realized that my close connection with Hispanic community or something or the shows that are a respect and support or their their vision and their lives have been great set of Texas\nWell amen to that for now I Am not even going to even try to put this endorsement on the same level as the national Latino law enforcement organization but I happen to be the executive director of the conservative Hispanic society and Governor Greg Abbott you have my one hundred percent confidence in full endorsement you need\nTo stay right where you are to continue to do to protect us a standing I I have no doubt this was going to put people at the top right here [laughter] yeah well well I Want to I'm going to call the election right now yeah very\nMuch for your from your lips to God's Ears last thing speaking of the election I could you just detail for me how important it is and I've been trying to make the case but maybe you can butter is it how important is this one last time for conservatives Republicans fair minded independence even disenfranchised Democrats\nTo vote straight ticket Republican this time around\n... they'll give you a couple of reasons one is that we take the race for the United states and uh we have a candidate who wants to raise your taxes\nAnd pose more government regulations spend more of your money and open our borders and and that is better work and I know some people are already hammered with him but if people are like that to work it is going to\nPut into the United States Senate someone who is hostile to the president's nomination to\nThe United States Supreme court as well as other things like that and so it would be a sea change in the way to the state of Texas has represented but even more so\nAnd that is a weather is losing the United States House of representatives to the Democrats have Maxine Waters and that's a closely running or the United States House of representatives wherever the case may be if we would have to lose an election in the state of Texas especially the statewide level\nIt would begin to tilt the United states more towards this aggressive liberal of socialist agenda\nAnd so this is a fight for the very soul of the United states of America as well as for the soul of the issues that have made America what it is you know so there's never been a time more important for you to go out\nAnd cast your vote in favor of your values to make sure that your voice was heard to make sure we keep taxes on the right kind of white all at one last thing that is the importance of the rule of law\nThe rule of law upheld or these Republican judges that we elect a Democrat judges abandoned the rule of law we need you to vote up and down the ballot to make sure that conservatives or Republicans are are elected office this November\nYeah and that's what we've been saying ... chicken Republican is your family's best defense against the left wing extremism we've seen playing out in the streets over these last two years Governor Greg Abbott sir again I keep on hitting the trail hard as I Know you are and thank you for the job you've done and praised gotten a job he will continue to do sir\nThank you and thank you for your endorsement\nYes sir I was my pleasure my honor to do so do I want five eight five seven three eight to eight one five I can see me like I tend to take a one more phone call before we go to the break here as soon as I can find my column screen Darryl appreciate your wedding welcome to present and said oh show\nCredits if it's a\nHit on a key point that a governor outage aside is that we must do everything to protect the sovereignty of you know the United states and protect people yeah\nAnd I think some church to the border which I'm all for we need to have their backs that we need to have done everything before you know they see the horde coming up and I think that you know the one thing we can do\nIs we can embargo sales of refined products the oil and gasoline\nThrough Mexico I'm back which is like ... oil company has a fifty percent stake in the show or find right here in Houston where they bring up by\nRecruiting ha they refine it and then\nThat refinery cells in a refined part back to Mexico so my first thought when I came up with this idea was civil asset forfeiture which you know when I shared it with people that jumped on and they said no no no that'll tamped down investment here and they you know here in the U.S\nSo sure I I think we can't go using people out there right so yeah I I doubt it off of your family members are okay well what about it yeah embargo it might be embargo is a better term we're just not going to sell it to you we have a history of doing that\nOr maybe we chat maybe we just ah maybe we use the terrorists the tariff weapon say well you know what if you if you want to send your products to market here in the United states and I know that the president just\nHanded this this deal with Mexico but I don't think it's a it's a done deal yet in the president\nWants to utilize that leverage and say you know what that man I I I Would really have to go to the force has to have your acquiescence for the horde allowing them to go through your territory to harm America I really hate for that to get in a way of our of our newly negotiate a trade deal\nUh a debate I mean how can that be I'm just trying to get my hands on my head around those\nI have observed market ... exactly what you observed and then the the what what you're seeing is different polls\nYou're you're you're not seeing the same polling service they're using different methodologies their samples are different ... nearly universally all of them with the exception of Rasmussen they they survey and inappropriate number of Democrats in their surveys\nI mean a counter balancing a Texas\nA poll with in in in order to amount of Democrats\nDoesn't make any sense because Democrats are not a number of Republicans in the state of Texas so right but they still but they still use that some of these polling services as part of the methodology they they over sample in other words Democrats\nAnd even in places where it's not appropriate to do so\nSo what you're seeing is different pulling services with different\nLevels of expertise in different levels of integrity to be quite Frank so I Would say you're safe in assuming that that Ted Cruz is anywhere from five points up for just by looking at the ... the real clear politics average five points up to nine points out somewhere in that range\n... and I would think though that that's good but I still think that the almost the same level as governor Abbott because their spouse obviously a lot of the same policies and that it almost across the board so\nBut now I mean we'll senator and that happens yeah senator Garner's a lot of attention uh so if you were looking even though our governor is going to be is in a more local\nA how shall we say a more local or\nOfficial here in very high profile in the state senator just tend to have nationwide recognition and us so they're they're both at the top of the ticket together you know what I'm saying\nOr maybe it and it can be argued that Ted Cruz is maybe a little higher on the maybe the top of the ticket and this and this go around because it is a federal position and not the same position [noise] but um I ... it all depends on who you're talking too much school of thought you subscribe to there [noise] but um again that's why it's so important to go straight ticket Republican\nBecause it's their business will be much of a prayer of knocking off crews are certainly not governor Abbott with his his uh on serious or opponent\nOr um I I Can't even tell you who is running against the Pentagon [laughter]\nAnd do the name to be honest the ... and I'm not saying that to be the reason I just have no idea what this person stands for because I don't I don't go into anti tax anti Americanism and that's what this individual stands for a\nBut a lot like I'm trying to tell you is it's a down balance stuff that we should be concerned about that than equally conservative good folks who are fighting in the trenches day in and day out\nTo keep us safe and to uh\nTo to make sure that the the rule of law and followed that we are properly represented\nIn the in a state that's where we got to look at it as as the governor said\nJudge and salad conservatives\nAre battling the Strauss leftovers there in the old by the way for the record ... Jones trials technically Republicans\nAre battling the joke Strauss leftovers he and his Mary ban of Democrats up there so we we got to make sure that the most conservative individuals' possible or sent back to Austin and even their lives who call themselves Republicans we will at least have a little more sway over them\nWill have no sway over a Democrat thank you mark appreciate the car right you're up next on the course they'll say don't show good morning to\nA pretty short time I Want to make a comment first and I have a question for you but I Want to respond to you and I should but the one issue where I grew up with a guy from part is immigration\nA street the caravan hoard the number of people remember independent not ... the ... the same to me to grow up and quick it\nAh I think that for every man\nWoman and child if their blood you're allowed to come in here they must be fading\nThey must be closed most of the house\nSomebody has to pay for that and the Americans already here when I ride around town as the homeless people were actually hungry cute trashy all those things I Would think that we should be able to focus with all respect\nAnd I believe in God thank God will protect those people in their homeland don't come across that border that's my statement that's my comment is\nI'm my question to you is\nYesterday I called it we were discussing a black lives matter movement now you say something that the black lives matter movement a is a reason that cops have been killed and I ask what the comparison but\nAh the guy in Carolina I think it was North Carolina made yourself\nAnd uh how somehow got gosh killed one man shot four or five others he goes from taking 'em your weight got shot in the bank and you come to me that he said he wanted to kill Whitey and somehow I just quit my English and I was you know what\nI said that the state might eagle so please tell me what you get the white man that's what it sounded like a show maybe you were the one who was confusing ignored for putting me\nYeah I understand your understanding confusion I was talking about the individual who was black up in Dallas you know here at home in Texas\nI said you know I was I I was talking about the man who gunned down five police officers are far ahead with what he wanted ... who's a yes a couple of years ago who said he wanted to make sure he killed white\nOfficers that was yeah it was wrong and now he was proud he was a proud ... T okay well not a lot of black lives matter\nWhen you have a ... a member of which is what do you what I don't think that uh ... what do you\nHold on let me let me ... let me play something for you this is another black lives matter more than I Am [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nThat's a ... thousand black lives matter you Marjorie and here's here's king hold on your king noble he is a he is a leader of the black lives matter movement\nTo me what the Houston Texans brutal execution before the public record to me\nIt's an open season\nAnd white police officers and probably killing ... period it's open ended in common with a white man will be picked off\nAnd nothing he can do about it\nThe day is it time ago\nWho witnessed more execution and killing of white people in cars\nAnd we ever had before\nThat's black lives matter\nLet me one day I don't subscribe to that I don't condone it and just wrong\nI read about that right now I agree with you I agree with you a hundred percent and by the way your your commentary on illegal immigration I'm One hundred percent behind you one hundred percent\nAppreciate that we will something up I think more than we know however a gig on understanding the condemnation uh when a\nCockpit skill but first we it's a black lives matter movement yeah some of those bigger say most chip away level of of of disdain when a white man killed raped and you're not white may kill ... yeah that's\nTrue that's true yeah and my my point my point yeah my point to yesterday was this right\nIs that when a white sub kills a police officer and just because he's a thug because he's a criminal or if a black sub killed a police officer because he's a criminal that's\nThat's just ... something you and I can't get behind when somebody killed a police officer because he's a white police officer\nThat was the difference I was trying to convey when you when you specify as the man did in Dallas that I'm there to kill white cops that's the difference so when you're out there killing concepts bad enough but when you're saying not there to kill white cops there's that's a different level\nOf depravity Kenya when I read them that\n\nThey got caught up in the fact that somebody joked new word in the\nAt the end you get the quiet means nothing to me they got caught it black and Hispanic and any other either did it to that you have any family members go what was it hard to say\nThat family members and he is is\nJust because somebody say the word it means nothing to me because it regain actually black people getting killed by black people in the white people getting care about white people and so it didn't matter what we usually\nDo it it it it doesn't matter who did it you're right but when when you\nSay my goal is to go out and kill a white person or my goal is to go out and kill a black person on my goal is to go out and kill the Latino person that that says\nNow and again I don't believe in hate crimes I ... I Believe I I think you're right that is dead and\nI I don't believe in getting into people's hearts and in prosecuting them because of all of their hatred I Believe\nIn killing anybody and hateful act but when when you have is your driving force", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lance Roberts", "city": "Tomball", "day": "26"}
