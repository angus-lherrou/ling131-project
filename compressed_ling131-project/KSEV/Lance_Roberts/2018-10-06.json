complicit in this alleged assault and then what you said there's one scene ... ran into them at the grocery store accidentally she was with her mother they walk in the door and mark judge is moving from shopping carts and he acted a plot\nStar that almost like a dog up that high bar\nAnd the prosecutor did not rocks on that but they ... the the million dollar question will let me get a strike\nWe're we're we're involved or this guy you're claiming witness and did not help your moment of terror when you're undergoing such a traumatic of that and that's the vents that you say as a practice for the last four decades\nAnd it's this event that you say it's a ... for the last four decades\nAnd rather than have an uncontrolled emotional response is this person that was complicit in this off all of that all you could muster up with the say Hi mark it doesn't make sense\nWell yeah and and and again the way she described it in her testimony was Highmark\nAs they are ... ... it was very a son who's very flowery and she had a ... yeah she had a voice like that anyway that indicated that a very uh ... voice even though she she does appear to be a a a older\nAnd what what surprised me was let me get a straight his laugh\nAnd his abandoning you as you were being sexually assaulted hunch has haunted you forever you can't get the the laugh out of your brain but six weeks after this alleged traumatic event you bump into him in your first instinct is to say Hi [laughter] yes I that didn't make any sense to me either\nOkay now I don't know from what she testified remember now we don't know they we don't know at times we don't know a place right I don't think\nEven if they report and the fact that she reports the same detail back them or lack of detail that is probably not enough that even a ring a criminal charge is probably not enough evidence at that point and bring a criminal charge\nHere's this was a little this is all of a sound a little crazy for this\nAh but if you do your own research I found some stuff on the Internet last night that there might be a deep say elements to her involved\nFirst of all he looked at her voice mail lawyer with the beard and the glasses on the rise a is Michael ... lawyer friend in the face\nWow that's right that's right but the lawyer on the left that were cast as a Clinton or\nWell wait a minute so if if Sheila Jackson Lee was pictured slipping what we think is a pay off\nA to Andy McCain's lawyer I mean this could in snare Sheila Jackson Lee not only in this Kavanaugh debacle ... where the arising gym that because all we need is a theory and all we need to do with huge because ... and the Democrats America just the accusation\nIs enough um to to tone FBI investigation we're theorize humans we've heard today that it could be a ran giving Sheila Jackson Lee money to uh\nTo undermine artificial process or it could be Russia or China we're not sure which but it doesn't matter we need a full FBI investigation before the election of of Sheila Jackson Lee in what was in that envelope\nPot but now you bring up an interesting point that she may have been trying to influence the ongoing investigation by the inspector general of Andy McCabe conduct\nRight wow so\nAnd the lawyer who left the female lawyer is Deborah cat Clinton more\nSo now for\nA morning there than there was a story out that says the ADA American Bar association is now urging that the vote the host home\nAnd remember yesterday in the questioning I think it might have been Lindsey Graham but someone said the American bar association the gold standard Dave judge Kavanaugh the highest writing as an ethical standards of integrity\nAnd they did that wasn't and that was Lindsey Graham yes\nNow today they are urging the vote the post post for further investigation that the opposite\nNow if you go into if you go on the Internet you put in her name for the law's a Ford and CIA will discover that her father and her grandfather were high level the IRA offered it\nShe is a professor of psychology professor at Stanford University she is in charge of the CIA internship program at Stanford\nThe fact that she can't give ties daisy played playing those details that she gave them would make it easy to disprove her store the fact that she does it with the help makes it impossible to disprove her story\nBut if you look at her father and her grandfather her grandfather was involved in a money laundering scheme in the eighties for drug money and when Reagan started investigating it they had in a fascinating\nIt's all it's all by name her father was a high level executive at a bank funded black operations of the CIA which was like a hundred steps on the White House\nAnd his own partly by black Locke which I understand\nYeah I've seen I've seen some of this reporting Jim why don't you just get to the end bottom line is for me what ... what do you think is at play here\n\nI I Would say is trying to walk up with this operative her story each day to sign up for the call with this court pick and ultimately is the the him and Twenty one\nUh well I I think we we didn't need all the background on on\nMiss Ford to recognize that there are elements inside of the never Trump movement the deepest so called deep state who are committed to making sure that Donald Trump does not get a second term because there are far too many people getting burned further illegal activity and I think that ... that Mitch or the Kavanaugh accuser is\nIs one such individual it's all she's ... she's part of a a large machine a cog in large machine a vehement anti Trump hers and ... and I am a cement status who want to see a a government of buy in for the people put up ground into the dirt\nAnd I think that's what we're saying\nHey Jim thank you for the call them and I appreciate the two one five eight seven three two one five I think taking a CB Lewis I appreciate your patience with them because they don't show let's say you\nMorning a is a great writer for America a great friday I'm just kind of going through the whole thing first of all we can't ask the FBI investigate anything when they can't even get their own house in order for you to wait on that like\nWell wait a minute here in order you know who you know who brought up a a great point one of our listeners run of the great point that if the FBI is investigated\nAnd and and evaluated judge Kavanaugh six times and if and if\nThese allegations are true which I don't believe they are but let's just say that they're true that the FBI missed it all the six times what's another FBI investigation going to reveal\nHey they're lucky Simon right right right [laughter] right but I mean you know hey I Am I Am proud of our president the fact that you're standing up for America told the whole world you know we're we're we're back on top and\nFor her attorneys\nThe ranking member and our member of Congress and she stayed at a she and her attorneys did not release a letter which means the only people that could have release that that letter or either the ranking member on her staff where the Democratic member of Congress because Dr Ford told the committee those are the only people who had\nOkay so there there you heard Senator Cruz indignant he knows exactly what happened we all know what happened this was all league by ... and of course you're going to hear Dianne Feinstein of California\nWasn't me it wouldn't mind do you want to be using a ... and ... on ...\nHow how the media get it then how do I mean if if Mrs Ford didn't release it and are attorneys didn't release it and it was only you political hacks on the Democrat side who had that had the media get it\nThat is not a fair process\nAnd we should look to the facts not anonymous innuendo and slander\nGerman I asked her point of personal privilege to respond person Smith Mr Chairman um let me be clear\nI did not hide Dr Ford allegations be yes I did not leave her stories she asked me to hold and confidential and I kept confidential as she passed\nShe apparently was started by the press sell that to what happened she was forced to come forward [laughter]\nAs suppresses fault and who does\n... who's betting does the press do\nThe Democrats the Democrats\nIt just magically appeared she was being stopped by the press because your office linked it Dianne Feinstein that's the reason why the press knew what was there\nBecause of rumblings that came out of your office map or the other Democrat lunatic congresswoman\nAnd our greatest fear for realized was realized she's been harassed she's had death threats because of you\nAnd she's had to flee her home\nIn addition the investigation that's a Republican majority is Harold ...\nIs really nothing that I Know about other than a partisan practice normally all the witnesses would be interviewed sour that's not happened while the majority is reached out to several people they did not notify me or my staff that they were doing this\nThat's nonsense the Democrats made up their mind they were not going to participate in any of this they they didn't send representatives to any of the meetings except for judge Kavanaugh the rest of the time the Democrats didn't care because Democrats objective wasn't upon the fruit the Democrats objective was delayed delayed delayed delayed delay that was their agenda\nAnd they're saying is way or\nAnother one a seven to one for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so far to argue that we would not participate but not tell us what they were up to his somewhat disingenuous I was given some information by a woman who was very much afraid to ask you to be held confidential\nAnd yours office failed to do so as did the either the congresswoman office or yours either way into the Democrats feet\nAnd I held it confidential until she decided that she would come forward\n[noise] ... would would be the ranking member on\nCentral question please if I can talk I Am great respect for sugar Feinstein we work together on many topics of I Believe what you should tell us your staff to non Lincoln all I don't believe my staff would lead to [laughter]\nOh you mean what what about the the Chinese spy that was driving you around for Nineteen years I don't believe that yeah we we know how credible your step is Senator Feinstein\nQuestion directly but I Do not know that I Would I mean how in the world and get my hands ... ... is you know the staff have you have you ever have us staff or other I drop dead food you know I\nJust did just now just in the committee hearing she didn't\nAsk them you know ten days ago Twenty years ago did you did you did you leap is she asked them and the committee hearing once a Republican forced her to answer although she had a one of her ...\nHer pardon me well hey genitals reminds me I've asked her befall\nYes how convenient thank you Jennifer for saving the senile old\nBat thanks much\nDoing one five I think five seven three to a to point one five I K as evening she'd line\nAnd you can all here's you blind Darren welcome to Brazil say it'll show what's going on\nI don't know I Can't remember how much money tax money\nUp for\nWhat you're saying the money that Sheila Jackson Lee gave to the attorney of Andy McCabe and the attorney representing the cabinet accuser that most of the source of the money was from the butcher shop Planned Parenthood exactly\nThe source of the money was from the butcher shop Planned Parenthood\nExactly this taxpayer money doesn't deserve it\nYou know I think you're right I mean I I think that this this call this is yet again you know what we ought to save\nThese accusations so every single time the FBI is ... ... because we now know the Democrats say every accusation most deserves an FBI investigation we ... we we must wait until the FBI investigates one allegation against Sheila Jackson Lee and then we must have\nAnother allegation is on the FBI will continue to continually have Sheila Jackson Lee under FBI investigation\nOr\nAre you really would you be willing to put on oh now that they're going to put you on the road and ask you where you heard this so let me ask you let me

Jay welcome to the voice of Texans\nThirty Chris I'm Christian Church or a voice of reason out there and a regulation goers excess you make it seem like the major job would you do but um I can only imagine they'll chose in this little or\nNo thank you very much for that sometimes it's a bit of a challenge but these days there is no shortage of things to talk about to say the least so we'll get on your mind you they\nWere a couple things understood the average ordinary citizen concerned with all the stuff that's going on everybody I Know I'm hearing a lot of kids in school with same there will certainly certainly there so it's changed everybody sees that everybody's names\nBut ah I think we have to change or a warfare tactics so to speak and um there was a bit out there it's just so I'm ... and it says ... billion Christians\nAnd starting to generate a lot of support and the reason is I'm fighting with conventional methods against a liberal or socialists we're not getting anywhere\nSo people are saying hey we have to do something ... we're do something better you know we can get their selves a gentleman in a a a courteous to people and things like that there's anything that's not going to work\nAnd you know we are right but no yeah yeah yeah\nI think you referred to something that we we know is the end the evangelical vote when Donald Trump Donald Trump's never been a big evangelical person but what happens I think America and the and he even jungles realized someone is good and it's kind of as Mitt Romney was absolutely trashed and destroyed by these monsters and they don't care so\nThey sent his looks and we need somebody to fight back I think America over the last well let me say a lot of conservatives or whatever so they are and we won that battle and we're doing now and everything seems to be no we're not even close to being done you're absolutely right and they need to get fired up and remember these people are not going to relinquish power freely\nDear Bully ... will use whatever tactics necessary to destroy anyone who gets in their way of power so in other words\nWe're not done voting we're not done being activated and we're not done rallying the troops if you will because and this is a proverbial war of ideology and these people on the left they have proven just like you said they will lie cheat steal do whatever they can destroy anyone who gets in their way\nAnd the ... as if you were an evangelical Christian understand your way of life is under attack in this country by those people\nAbsolutely you know what honestly believe it was Christian gentleman was lower body works hearts family orientated\nThat's what this country great in the first place and people were taken for granted and I'm going to uh just suggest that people um take a look at that or the or says ... billion Christians 'cause it's cold or a billion Christians to praise the lord or on\nEaster Sunday in twenty hoarding and there was a a thing underneath that was\nA bright where we started ... older people to check that out and uh 'cause I I think we're on certainly here we have to change the fact that\nYou know I think well I Know I think we saw what unfortunately needs to be done thank you for the call Jim appreciate it appreciate the kind words as well I think you're right when you say we have to change their tactics clearly the Mitt Romney tactic\nThe ... and even as much as I Love Ted Cruz and we see how much more of a fighter years' worth he's always fought for us but he wasn't prepared for that kind of nastiness in in the primaries we saw snow a lot of it came from Trump now we see was directed\nAnd unfortunately it's like I said I Am all behind from\nHim actually when it comes to smashing the mosque these monsters on the less\nThey smash him day in and day out and I'm Talking about politics I'm Talking about the media the never farmers every day they trash this man every single day and then when he came back he somehow among [noise] unfortunately we need somebody like that just like when you go to war\nAnd are they going to go after him or maybe you know somebody I don't know it's just um [noise]\nI just don't I just don't get it I'm I'm a little older and I just don't get it I you know you say something bad about somebody you better be able to back it up if you can't back it up there and you know either don't say it or be prepared to face the consequences which would be slander which is I don't know\nYeah where do you know I mean what do you think I'm a little and I I think you're right on a couple of levels because I agree with you I tend to be a little bit more old fashioned I'm leaving due process it I Believe if you go and say something unsubstantiated you need to be able to back it up and if you don't you need to be prepared\nTo get smacked upside the head by the court if you will but that being said understand when you talk about laws on the books being enforced we have almost a virtually entire Democratic Party that wants that refuses refuses to enforce federal immigration laws they will ignore them\nOkay just because they don't like them and they will only follow the laws that they want to follow and then they want to pass the laws for the rest of us that we have to follow thinking about this they claim they want an open border basically the Democrats want to open up the borders get rid of them on California and in Arizona and New Mexico and Texas of course right here\nAnd went over the border and we know for those of us who pay attention\nThere were thousands of people coming to horrible ends in Mexico and they were being shot in my high powered weaponry they're being blown up they're having their heads cut off their hacked in pieces by these monsters that are in the cartels\nAnd those borders would be wide open for those people because they virtually are at this point not completely wide open but they would open up to that but these the same people
