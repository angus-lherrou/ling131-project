T. it has become a social justice academy\nSocial justice being a euphemism for the liberal agenda do or whatever the progressive orthodoxy is and every academic department at UT as well as administrative bureaucracies are become loaded with social justice\nWhich is just an open ended license for administrators and faculty to spin left wing left this propaganda socialism identity politics\nDividing the world between oppressors and victims\nAh it cetera uh and in pursuant to that we've seen removal of historic statuary a and a commitment to diversity which is the separate second second prong of red send us as ideological agenda\nYeah social justice as we all know ladies and gentlemen in the absence of justice and and now it's part of the curriculum at the University of Texas Austin ... is our guest right now folks he is a a writer living in Austin and he has been published in several publications across the screen land\nI was surprised to learn that a University of Texas at Austin law professor and a post graduate federal argue that Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed\nBecause Brett Kavanaugh wasn't on board with affirmative action which we all know is state sponsored racism I we've always believe in the south said will show that if you're going to stop racism the number one thing you gotta do is stop being a racist and affirmative action is a form of racism\nWhat is the University of Texas Austin doing tolerating this\nWell not only the two professors make this editorial and of course professors and anybody is free to express their opinion they wrote this and it was posted on duty a Web site as if it were the official position of the University of Texas\nAnd yeah so they're saying cabin on should be opposed because he's going to stand it it's going to stand between a duty and achieving diversity which again is or euphemism above word a label standing for affirmative action which is preferential admission\nOf people on the basis of their race or ethnicity who\nAre ... ah yeah as cool as qualified but also the diversity initiative at UT goes beyond that we have racial separate system has developed where we now have separate orientations for black students homecoming separate black homecoming as black student\nLounges separate black graduation ceremonies\nAnd the latest thing and this has come under funded us and I think is probably the most radical thing he's done so far is they've come out with a diversity initiative\nThat is going to impose I Believe faculty hiring quotas based on race and ethnicity and they put in charge of the most radical person working at the University of Texas Ted Gordon promoted him to be vice provost for diversity\nAnd this is the guy who's the founding had over ... sees African American studies department and it's insane he he believes that the UT fight song the eyes of facts are fondue is a racist song\n[laughter] and he got his and he tire him so why not let's hire him\nOh my God love mark route a time but I I look at mark Pulliam everybody is going to keep an eye on this and if anything else breaks if we start hiring teachers at the University of Texas Austin because of their

tell you that now trust me\nNumber to look at the rate and the cost before you go for a loan you've heard me say it in the form of looking at the right without the cost is like looking at one side

what's done and who does it for you 'cause it's gonna be your home that number to the amount of feller contribution comes directly off of your bottom line\nMeaning it lowers the amount you need to bring the closing much more effective than lowering the sales price right Chris\nWhy is that tell me why why is it better to have lower money and closing the lower money purchased\n... because the the loan amount that you get is based on the sales price of the home okay and so if you lower the sales price it means you lower your loan them out\nSo if you have a two thousand dollar reduction say you're probably going to bring three or four hundred dollars left to the closing\nThey were going to whereas if you have a two thousand dollar seller contribution you're going to bring two thousand dollars less to the closing negative difference between lowering the sales price and I sell her contribution is like the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit\nI Gotcha I Gotcha well
