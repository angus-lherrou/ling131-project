I ... yeah I I'm again and\nThis is something that the Mexican government the drug cartel run Mexican Government doesn't want to give up the billions launched Kevin and drug money\nAnd an agriculture to the right cat ill\nLegitimate and illegitimate functions of Mexico will take a huge hit if Trump is forced to follow through with this and they don't want it so they have every incentive to stop this caravan\nAnd you you know what prompts a vote for a Democrat is a vote for Moore caravans because the caravans are coming up this way because they believe Democrats will bring them into the United states thank you very much for the call Kevin I appreciated Andy Europe next year in the Texas what say you\nUm\nWhat they should do is what he's doing now he uh he put a shot out the Honduras Guatemala CEOs and said hey\nYou know getting money you're throwing these people around and they do the same thing with Mexico but even if it was even if they what they were trying to do was to get asylum and and they really how to you in case\nFallen soldier coming Mexico correct\n... that they're there the next to Jason country\nShort so not only is not on us it isn't it is the left\nThis will use any body they can to try to get back in power and that's what they're using with these\n... yes exactly if you you hit that you had the political the political problems right on the head because what success the only success I Would say the Democrats had against Trump wasn't Andy\nOh you're separating illegal alien gets ruined their illegal alien parents\nAnd that the president took a hit because of that so they want to replicate that jumps before the election\nWell I don't know ... ... I don't know if he took a hit\nOn that for me when I talk about I'm Talking about that I'm Talking about the the\n... the mindless mine numbed left us\nTo believe that everybody around the world has the right to come to the United states of America whenever the hell they want and oh by the way we can't go any place else we have to stay here we can't go any place else but everybody else can come here and that that that's how these\nThese left wing or the government run education into the universities have been instructed it's wrong it's inane but that's what they've been told\nYeah and and I look I understand there's a vote happening in a couple of weeks\nBut hey Mr Cruz this is your state that current event is coming to your state would you get off your toothbrush and get in front of a camera and tell them no way for them but ah you know even the ... the governor out on this worth lieutenant governor on this\nWell it is in my memory waiting\nOn my property taxes to get better for twenty five years ago from Ben Petrick\nWell well again it again and you can saint Joe ... Matt\nI mean I understand that but that's about ... what what what what do you want what do you want a damn pattern to do what do you want to let the governor to do fascinate Joe Strauss would that make you happy [laughter] [laughter] I'm gone I\nI mean I'm Glad I'm Glad he's retiring and he's gone though so there is this is why ... says well exactly\nExactly no more but again so did you do you realize how many conservative bills came out of the Senate to go in die over in Jones trousers house ... United or few fathom how many actually would've been great protects us but we're stop by that leftist\nChris I understand that but people who who want to lead you to they read a short look Trump Trump Trump became president almost two years ago ... and nobody was on his side hardly anybody up there was on his side\nWhen our bodies that is nobody lives and the ultimate look around you have do you have do you have a wall do you have all all bill yet hold on to say hold on you know wait a minute let me ask you do you have a wall built yet\nThat's the only ones that didn't the wall is only\nAs Obama tears deal with this whole Chris is Obama I don't I don't look listen let's go through this is Obamacare still with us\nNo three senators three senators\nNo I I understand that but Obama clear is still Obamacare is still inflating the nation let me ask you about the spending did you see the omnibus bill we are ... ... we're still spending our children and grandchildren into oblivion right now\nAnd Donald Trump Donald Trump ... again but what I what I'm trying to draw the parallel for Andy is you can get up there and you can lead only so much\n... and and the Donald Trump is the only went up there talking about these things about being serious on these things\nJust like the governor the governor the only ones match here at home talking seriously about these things but if these leftists who unfortunately have reins of power to they want elections to unless they come along and are forced to come along by their constituents there's only so much you can do\n... Chris I fully understand everything\nSo just like Donald Trump has done great things just like the vice president has done great things so far to the best of their ability to governor Abbott and lieutenant governor Dan Patrick done great things to the best of their ability we have got\nIndividuals' down there at the southern border where no one has said has them we got National Guard backing up our border patrol but and we're paying for it\nThat wasn't that wasn't or anybody else except for the governor of Louisiana Governor who made that happened and no and California New Mexico and Arizona don't have that\nWe do so you got to give some credit where credit's due in recognize the limits of their power there there are limits to government power in this country and in the state right\nChris I fully understand fully understand it but\nBut now you're going to see why knows what we're seeing Graham we have seen McConnell all of a sudden they have the the life let me okay I'm going to give you this you tell me why what year what our property taxes the rectified\nI have another little guy I haven't a clue I I ... I can guarantee you we don't get out and vote straight ticket this election and they'll never get lowered\nBecause you'll let you lead the Joe Strauss crowd back in to the uh the Texas House I can guarantee it won't get done if you don't get out there and get a a thousand of your close friends to vote straight ticket Republican I guarantee it won't happen\nWell I don't have a thousand close friends you have an\nAll out there live well I I look for each one of us has a sphere of\nInfluence around four hundred Andy okay and I want you to use every bit that you can\nBecause that's what's at stake I Know the property taxes are harming your family\n... let me let me can expand on my comparison\nFrom Trump and all the never Trump or is that are in the Republican side and on the federal level you've got governor Abbott lieutenant governor Dan Patrick here in Texas [noise]\nLet's hope it goes on the phone votes right because I'm On the east\nGermans made it here onto American soil I mean you've got you've got all your history there there were German agents that were arrested here on American soil\nOne ... so\nNow what about the Mexican military\nSo you know the ...\nThey've already been on our side or the ... the Mexican military the Mexican military is already encroach on our territory and as a matter of fact fired on our border patrol agent so so why why do why ... why would the United states military deployed to stop the military for a program on our soil\nOut enough um [noise] it was really rather\nOkay well again I Am going off president by court rulings\nBy the use of the American military and there was a neutral zone on the U.S military on the U.S Mexico border where they can be deployed don't misunderstand what I'm saying Ron\nI I'm not saying we can't utilize the military I'm just saying that you've got to be very careful because on the west wing death spot who takes over the presidency like the last guy\nCould one day utilize could one day utilize that private oh I Need to protect Americans from some for whether it be you right wing crazy people or whatever and they're there for your protection\nYou know there's there is there is a way to do that Marshall Law can be declared\nTo get the United states military on the streets but in the streets of US cities are on American soil it's problematic that's all I'm saying to you if you look at the history of jurisprudence if you look at the ruling that have been and I understand what the law says\nBut as you know or you should know wrong\nAnd the courts have made ... certain elements of our law and interpreted our law differently precedent hasn't been that I'm not saying it's right I'm not saying I agree with it I'm just saying it is what it is\nSo there are some water you got to navigate and just sitting there and the lively declaring well just do what read the text of the law while you know why some guys in black robes did that too when they came to a different conclusion than you did\nI I I probably agree more would you Ron then I Do with them\nBut it doesn't make this it doesn't make me dictator nor does it you\nKnow there are things you have to consider and coming on a radio program in blind the declaring well the law says this yeah I understand all of that I'm Talking about practical application and what needs to be done and I do believe there is a way to deploy the U.S military down that border\nI Believe that they will stand up to constitutional in judicial muster what you were in a couple of calls ago with Kevin let some left wing judge somewhere\nGoing to find a way to try to put a strain on that citing precedent as a hobby ... has been adjudicated over the years so I just like I said\nIf you're going to do it I Want every possibility of success best way to do it is either a neutral zone or straight on\nYour way one time I think I have a three two one five I can see the Tony glad you waited walk in the south into ...\nI'm a combat Carlos [noise] real quick [noise] or ... years coach ... but it is a ... year old [noise]\nReally I'm a court according to the there's an exclusion flick of all of the U.S coast guard\nYou know virtually all day long ago would have been an armed\nService the U.S coast guard operate under the department of homeland security during the time and it's not only restricted by law to comment on his act but at the listed authority to enforce federal law so they they are they are exempted from the policy kamikaze exception\n...

people say very consequential because it will determine how far the Trump agenda progress is what's your take on the political landscape\nUh I think we're a figure out of trust us right now I think it with politics there's always this kind of ... it was a federal that's constantly shrinking\nAh one direction or the other and uh with the wave media consumption is being changed I mainly being done by way of online I'm an independent broadcasts such so\nUm you're getting a lot of people who are now jumping into the conversation and jumping into politics\nThat doesn't necessarily mean they know

caravan of now four thousand people coming up in Central America timing with the election\nTo infiltrate or try to infiltrate the country illegally and overburden our citizens overburdened our system or he has pledged to send the military to stop them and now my understanding is Mexico\nHas now believe it or not this is the report now we've been ... by this kind of stuff before but the reports are saying that Mexico is mobilizing their police to stop this caravan\nIn their territory and\nTurn these people back around my question is how they get by your militarized southern\nBorder I mean they're border as militarized they're Mexican military is on the southern border of Mexico\n\nI um I tell ya ah something about this doesn't smell right what I think happened as Mexico said oh yeah we're just going to do what we always do\nSlough off our neighbors problems in our problems to the United states and then Trump uses the N. word military on the U.S Mexico border and the drug cartels went nuts\nThe agricultural community in Mexico went nuts and now all of a sudden Mexico saying we're going to send the police what are you guys think did Trump do the right thing should\nShould he have used to threaten to use the military do you do you agree with his decision\nShould he had to use to threaten to use the military do you do you agree with his decision\nAnd where are Democrats on this\nWhy don't you hear any Democrats getting out in front of the microphones maybe we will later today maybe Nancy Pelosi was asked\nMe neither welcome ... are they going to an antibiotic loud fang and killing that\nKj thank you for holding glad you made it to the ... ... what's going on\nThis or a you know I've been traveling through jak last couple of months\nAnd then I asked you help wanted signs from the store to see the aisle drivers\nSo little convenience store manufacturing I'm never see somebody help wanted signs ever from Del Rio begs right God Waco to download it on ... you know the Nineteen Ninety itself around around\nWhen I was growing up there I think that was Desert Storm\nThey added at checkpoints and that's our military arm German shepherds everywhere they had that at checkpoints solid show where we're at active war Desert Storm I mean\nI'm asking you that question\nWhy was the military there at the checkpoints\nI don't know are there are there are there and for for me it was amazing\nWell now now wait a minute and you know whose military did you say you saw\nOur our our military where they were they armed\nYes arm dogs every day I was able to go in and talk to a lot of soldiers wrist watch actually rocks game in one of the offices and I have a lot of questions like Nineteen Ninety\nNine Ninety but all I Am a Democrat or a storm yeah\nOK so point is we were in the act of war correct\nWe well we were we were in a state of ... yeah I mean I mean I I get during Desert Storm out so that that's a we're in a time of war and when our our military is deployed abroad yeah\nOkay so we were actually there at checkpoints that we weren't ever order or either the checkpoints thirty miles and miles and yeah\nI made a deal but yeah and again did you know what branch separate from where they come out for a National Guard yeah National Guard is permitted ... doesn't apply to the coast guard or to the national guard\nOne other thing yeah if you want to see all those help wanted signs disappear vote Democrat\n[laughter] yeah exactly great great point kj great I thank you very much appreciate it above you're up next year in the course you don't say it'll show let's say you are just made it is you is this me high\nYeah hey ah anyway\nI think Dwight David Eisenhower during operation what back in the fifties or support the military to round a whole bunch of uh illegal immigrants a factor and it was legal to call the Web by\nBringing back across the border of Mexico I bet you do it two or three times as you would do it once and they would come back in the year\nAnd the reason he was doing it because after World War two\nHe wanted the ah voice coming home from work to have jobs and uh\nYou know it's just not the exact same situations but these people were invading our country and ah you know it was going to look horrible if we sit in the military down there with women and children but we we got to do something to stop it even if we have to go into Mexico and help them stop it at the airport\nYeah and you know it's I don't remember reading at some point that Mexico where were they neutral in World War two\nI Believe so Chris further\nYeah I mean I think that again I think there may have\nThey're all they're always for your school because we don't want to they don't really have a military the drug cartels actually robots British country where we really should do's invade Mexico is go kill all the drug cartel people in the week that\nWell I'm not art but I think that's where I I think I think those drug cartels are afraid of having US military on the Mexican border that's why you're seeing the Mexican militaries\nAre the threat of using the Mexican meal a day or the American military prompting the Mexican authorities to try to stop this caravan because of all of a resident said I'm\nTemporarily take over Mexico like jeopardy took over Iraq\nI mean miles off this mess I mean yeah I have to stop it it's it's just it's just ridiculous\nYou know I'm tired of illegal immigrants too I really\nWhere where are you up at five mistakes it's two thousand and six with Bush and it gets old I mean that's that's twelve years we've been talking about the same crowd\nWhen a longer than that I mean we we have endured illegal immigration and Republicans and Democrats ignoring the people on this for the better part of four to five decades\nWhere everybody knows what's going on across the bridge as many stupid people image that can teach them how to vote Democrat\nWell that's a Democrat motivation you know what the Republican motivation is\nThat what she passed labor exactly exactly maybe it'd\nWe used to get it Chris but we'd go down there and get it when we needed it and send it back and that's the way and I'm from Houston we used to do that all the time go down to get people bring 'em up or let them work for a while and it took them back\nYou know we call our mobile responsible for their members\nWould arrow program exactly you you need to have orderly immigration I have no problem with bringing in foreign workers if he'll do the job for last so long as there is a responsible party and they're not allowed to say you don't become an American because you come here and work and you know and they quit her\nBabies when they come up here that can never aggravated\nWell well they well they can I'm not I'm not going to sit there and tell any human being and they can't I mean that's that's a communist China does ... what I Will say that yeah I I Will say\nThe fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment was designed for slaves\nSlaves was without it\nFor everybody including the char needs to go over to drop is it all of a sudden\nThere needs to have been malarkey the Supreme Court must be made to finally rule in the fourteenth amendment application to what you call rightly called anchor babies are and that that's that's not a pejorative that's not a ... that's not a term that applies only to Hispanics it applies to any organization it was time to be leaving or on\nA pardon me time these are doing it in California\nThey believe that this will cause some negative stereotype to take hold just before the election of mean Republicans wanted to turn away women and children who are seeking legitimate asylum which they're not on that southern border that's what I Believe it was a player\nWill enter you can hear you can prove that it is left with money I'm going to think that don't get me wrong it's great\n'cause we're not talking about the fact that the deficits friction to\nExplode due to the tax cuts we're not talking about the fact that all you're wrong there we're not talking about the debate over where the Saudis embolden trip through this or this diplomat because of their business charge that you're going to help your bags Oscar ready to run down to the border\nIs run by the way by the way you can't you can't have a deficit exploding unless you've spent\nIf you don't spend liberal you can't uh a liberal Dale you can't you can't explode the deficit unless you spent\nSo I'm not you it's not ... it's not tax cuts that they cause deficits\nIt's tax cuts if you don't if you decrease your revenue stream of course and you don't\nWell wait a minute wait a minute no no wait a minute and decreased revenue doesn't cause the deficit there's only one thing that causes the deficits are and that most cleansing that spending the money you don't have your operating on a flood assumption that every bit of spending that's done by the federal government is legitimate and you're wrong you're wrong\nSo you're I mean come on critics I quit my job and actually expanded the same amount of money yes my personal deficit will increase\nWhy doesn't that why does that concept apply to the federal government in your mind\nThat that's what I'm saying if they if they don't stop spending if they don't change if they don't stop spending\nAfter they cut taxes of course any ... of course you're going to encourage me not just common\nRight so what so what causes the deficit is it the reduction in revenue from because they're they're taking less when the American people's pockets or is it spending money you don't have you tell me\nWell it's a combination of both\nI disagree no not ... you don't get it that if you don't spend that money you don't have you don't get a deficit let me ask you losing your so you lose your job do and you continue to spend\nMoney that you don't have sooner or later you're going to pay the piper right is that our sponsor is that responsible of you to continue to spend money you don't have\nNo it's not\nNo it's not as a matter of fact it's a high degree of responsibility is not so sooner or later that the bill is going to come do why do you not think that that that same concept should apply to the federal government\nOr ... or are they going to offset the tax\nI did ask a question there buddy but how why do you not think that concept applies to the federal government\nAnd it does but you haven't shown me where they're going to offset the the the tax cuts\nIt but I don't I don't need to offset tax cuts I don't see\nEye as an American citizen I'm telling my government here is what I'm willing to give you see I'm the boss you see I'm an American citizen I Am willing to give this much of my personal income taking it away from my family's priorities to my government and here is that dollar figure\nAnd then you've got simmering little girl pans of both political parties\n[laughter] you're

priorities [noise]\nAnd then and then you can't have all your wish list you can have all of your entitlement programs you can have all of these these\nAh graft programs designed to keep all elected leaders in office what you do do is you spend the proper amount of money that is given to you by your boss you can't you can't go\nTo your boss right now Dale and say I'm going to spend money more money than you give me and my expense account you can't do that but you want to empower the government to do that and I think one of the wrong\nIf I've got a budget by ... and again maybe you're not have a different understanding economics 'cause if I have a budget and then I'm going to have less money coming in where am I gonna cut where am I going to cut in that budget\nAnd yeah so I didn't grow grown ups grown ups have to have that conversation Dale grown up to him I didn't ...
