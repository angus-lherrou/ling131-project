a credible we we identified ridicule their number one and accuser number two which is completely off the rails accuser number three who's ...\nClient by the way by the way ... could you have a minute hold on a minute Tucker Carlson was\nEvaluating avid nutty and what he means the Democrat Party and that this is what this is what the Democrats on the basket of biased press were saying about having a\nLot of it I Would be okay that is true and he seems to me and he keeps popping Donald Trump and all of them so can the mouse and each of them he maybe even the republic he\nReally didn't master the need for an apology for the last little leads to say I'm not already Michael I have you every where what is a lot to say around rather have a lot to say the Democrats can learn something for you and\nThen the Kavanaugh hearings unfolded for it and then all of a sudden you started hearing liberals comparing Avon nutty to Steve Bannon yeah he's\nHe he he is being regarded as the Democrats Steve Bannon some of your democratic colleagues had been saying that the Democrats your fellow Democrats case against you got this Kavanaugh was weekend by Michael ...\nBy a lot but I probably the best thing for ... I mean all the Democrats that have been flirting with him they've got to really be embarrassed look\nA lot of Democrats are saying and are you hearing the ... took what was a sympathetic case before and turn it into a circuits losing them the high ground you know Michael I have an audio surfaced comes to town\n... came in with the the sweating allegations of drug gang rape stuff that things have been much less taken as credible having that he did a huge favor to the White House\nSo there you go Avon out each client is going to be in legal trouble because she is made sworn statements under oath that she's now backtracking and she's gonna she's going to get prosecuted which is which is fabulous but Fred ... don't you find that turned about just hysterical\nI Believe that he has withdrawn from their case\nAnd I believe that he has withdrawn from their case so in other words [laughter] folders and he pulled his older stringers out\nWhat a skill and whether he ... he really is\nOne other comment about your financial lives that was on just a few minutes\nOf goes claiming yeah from Fox Business\nI don't disagree with her here's the point when you start jacking interest rates people start putting their money in the bonds and into a savings accounts and things like that why when interest rates are low\nKnowing that reporting or even your well not more secure and you're getting a better return on your money it's it's a safer bet than the ebbs and flows of the stock market\nWhat what uh Chris\nIf you don't have those avenues to put your money and you have to you'd have to invest in a shopping centers of park much houses office buildings you have to invest it and hard things that that employ people to build to do things\nIn it and it generates the economy\nIn other words everything benefits my mother used to go to Jake and put more money out of those things that were more volatile and making them into bonds [noise]\nThat's that's a fetch counterproductive because actually not bonds are not hiring anybody bombs are just sitting there are cranking away\nBut it's still invest it still investment capital it's still being used as investment capital it doesn't sit there and do nothing it in ... it's not instance\nNo no it's not instant but again there's also a problem you know Fred with saving in this country nobody has been able to start saving because interest rates are so low you're getting no return on your money\nSo now that you are getting a bit of a return on your money these ... and I'm not saying that everybody should be switching all of their money from stocks and bonds or into more secure\nA savings assets but it gives you a it allows you to diversify and still maintain a positive growth victory on your money\nIf you look at the worst thing that has happened to this country Christian that's credit cards welded been able to go out and borrow money on credit cards no no no collateral was loans\nNowhere no interest no interest charges yes\nOr no interest in in all of a sudden when you're late one time\nYour interest you're no charge interest rate or your low interest rate all of a sudden jobs twenty seven percent you know the number one cause of bankruptcy of individuals in this country if you look at the ones that have filed bankruptcy\nTheir biggest it is in the ... oh just\nShine here I'll sign just say I want a car and all of a sudden you have a twenty thousand dollar credit line or a thirty thousand dollar credit line\nAnd bingo you're in the whole\n[noise] no I I understand all of that dynamic to but again I think maybe your bud missing my point a little bit that free and easy money isn't the best thing and it costs you a little more people will start evaluating in his interest rates rise and I I think Liz struck the right tone the fed just needs to be more\nCautious and how it says we are on a glide path here toward raising interest rates\nIt also is the way I look at it as banking for the future because if we do get other economic downturn you're able to utilize those quiver is in the era that we were already in zero so or the the ... the arrows in the quiver ... we were down to zero we had no other place to go so\nIf we're building houses apartments office buildings in shopping centers how many people are we putting work versus sticking money in to bond funds\nThat's all going to get done anyway that's all that and but you know what you said shopping centers I don't know Fred that shopping centers are the investment of the future as online merchandising is starting to make the mall go the way of the dinosaur\nUh as far as uh purchasing mecca thanks for the call buddy to weigh one by by by seven three aid to a one five at a KFC let's review from yesterday\nHe's not seen him all with a political party that wants to destroy\nYou stand for what you care about that's why I Believe we are fortunate enough\n... you can start again\nThat's Hillary Clinton basically saying Democrats can be civil once they're in power but until then antifa black lives matter the violence the ... what we saw on University of Texas campus\nWith pro Kevin also having their science ripped from their hands and ripped apart by violence extremists\nAre that's going to be the cold today Maxine Waters moms showing up in restaurants driving conservatives out of those restaurants\nAre like Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Ted Cruz that's what we're going to see until the babies get a pacifier and they get power and they can tell you what to do again Kellyanne Conway counselor to the president had this reaction on Fox to Mrs Clinton\nUsually when she opens her mouth and he actually she than at least one half of the country and should get it again I think are different now it's a little bit dangerous I don't like the implication Harris one thing to college to formal game of all black people who don't have all the privileges that she has had\nWith her I mean the law degree into her marriage too much more popular [laughter] and it actually with the term she'll never I don't like that kind of talk and I am related to my mind off his ... he said he represent all Americans we don't run around\nAsking people what their party affiliation is when he's cutting taxes and allowing small they should be free of regulation gross\nOr do you guys get to the bar words he said that\nHer husband's actually popular Mrs Clinton's husband and actually a two term president that she'll never be\nWearing courteous to that and yes and I wanted to say something else I don't see all these democratic candidate banging on Hillary Clinton door around her anxiety na I'm dancing around when you get a certain ... city tour a hundred and twenty million dollars you know they're not they're not they're\nNot going to donate your son's censure on women and girls I I don't see her doing that so I think it's not just I was fortunate in ... a little bit dangerous to ask her to check that\nAt the generation the number one priority and you can easily see why that it was because of the social media because\nUh we put up a filter on Instagram that make our lives look perfect and so we have\nA as a generation generic movie has the desire for perfection and for happiness that that quite frankly isn't always reality and so those are some of the key differences that are in many ways shaping our world view of the way we see important issues and our culture in our\nSociety and and the the lands in which we're going to new uh the world and interact in in our communities and our nation\nThe college environment is exactly what I Would call\nBalanced isn't exactly welcome to divergent attitudes meaning it's it's predominantly progressive it's predominantly liberal and if you stray like Kanye West you you get ... that similar type of push back how was Gen Z\nA demanding or or are they demanding a change in that dynamic\nYeah that's a good question I think it all starts with a conversation right and so in many ways and many times we are simply not having\nConversations with generation the\nAd that I've made it to people from different sides of the aisle they have to come together and talk out their differences on how they would approach initially where Solomon issue and as you've said that conversation just is not always happening on university and college campuses and in more cases than not it's just not\nHappening altogether so that's where we need to start we need to start by having this dialogue you know we work with genes on campuses and and I was talking with some democratic didn't not too long ago and I said hey we\nWe agree but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a conversation and dialogue about the and it doesn't mean that I don't think you should be involved and and civic engagement but let's talk about the differences are of the two ... and that's what we need more of an our generation those\nThose conversations the dialogue and we have to be careful that we don't just let social media to take over and not have those real conversation\nThat's hard to have those real conversations in two hundred and eighty characters or less [laughter] right [laughter] exactly\nThe problem they need to be face to face conversations on campuses and knock but we need to get to\nAudrey jak or I guess right now folks president of I'm tomorrow nonprofit organization with a mission of engaging young Americans in civic responsibility on a hundred damages over our great land the baby boom generation I made reference human before they are by and large your professorship\nA Dutch changing but by and large they are those who are\nTeaching in our universities God help us all a how much of an impediment to coming together and having these dialogues you said a generation Z wants to have our the baby boom professors\nYeah there's certainly a big disconnect right now between the generations and that's a dangerous because uh my generation millennials an generation they need to learn from the generation that have gone before it's we say all the time and I'm tomorrow that there are proven principles that have been proven to work throughout\nThe history of humankind that we need to learn from uh and and our nation was founded on many of those principles so when you don't have the dialogue\nBetween generation you're not learning from uh the experiences of those that have gone before us now on the flip side baby boomers need to recognize that at the next generation at need that\nAnd there's been this low expectations that for millennials in particular and I think it's carrying over to a generation knee wear\nOut a little bit disregarded like they just simply don't need a seat at the table and that's going to be dangerous for the future of our country because we are very quickly by twenty twenty and make up over half\nOf of the voting population and our country and so if if we don't have a seat at the table or they tried to exclude us from that that even more dangerous when union it'd be a part of\nThe conversation and dialogue but one thing that that baby boomer can do and they can make that connection for the next generation there's a lot of of the millennial generation ... who are apathetic to the political process\nAnd so we need to communicate the message\nThat you might not like politics nobody liked politics but what we do like and what we are what we do care about are the issues that affect our lives the lives of people in our community and our nation millions of other people so\nSo long and the involved and have them pour in conversation not pick a new like politics because new care because you care about other people and you care about your community and naturally why are the next generation needs to be involved the baby boomer they didn't make that connection for the next generation\nYeah and you know it's a far too many of them are engaged in the politics of Tuesday so many people hate rather than actually thinking about steps two\nThree four down the line when it all means Audrey decker everybody president of I'm tomorrow I Am too M.

defend the nation that all this other discussion is moot\nIf you don't make sure America exists and of course you heard him he doesn't believe America has any enemies [laughter]\nAnd there's no amount

have done one thing which may be the Lynch pins and we'll see if the states are successful in suing at it getting rid of the individual mandate but we still suffer under Obamacare So you can't and and and the Republicans aren't talking about it\nAnd so you can't say that the Republicans have done anything miraculous for healthcare yet\nNow if removing the individual mandate causes the

look it up ladies and gentlemen ethanol may be worse for the environment than straightforward gasoline\nAnd our job is done this in an effort to say as he said increase the fuel supply which will keep prices lower\nAll well and good but it's junk and this junk science and it's a pay off to the corn states are we all know it\nYou know after the corn states how we all know what's going to happen when we start burning are few our food as fuel that food costs is going to go up and corn is in everything my friends and that's just not this is not good this is not great\nThis is not fair and free markets this is this is a problem by the way you know what it takes more energy to make ethanol than ethanol saves so it's not even it's not even good sound environmental policy\nIs however a pay back
