huge for another day\nAnd here's why I say this because\nNotre Dame can be one of those teams could be that team that that lockout another power five conference theme from the college football playoff\nAnother free to Notre Dame team will get in period\nEven though they won't play conference championship game\nYou guys know the history you know the the driving force behind that its Notre Dame they will want them in their college football playoff it'll bring ratings\nViewers you know the view of the top top blind viewership\nAnd that it's good for college football\nAnd if they get this when on the road against Virginia Tech and it's not to say because we see\nTime and time again every year teams that\nLook like they have an easy\nEasy run to finish up to the next up their toe once or twice\nA year to their opponent with all the Perry that we're starting to see more and more now every year in college football\nBut if they beat the twenty Third Reich hokey this weekend Blacksburg which is going to be a tough tough tough task for Notre Dame\nBut if they do that they they will have three remaining road games this season\nAt navy at Northwestern and then at us see in the season\nWith an remaining home games against it for the state who's\nHaving a terrible year and Syracuse\nIn Syracuse might\nBe able to give them a game\nAnd usa maybe as well\nWhen the undefeated Notre Dame could so a huge ranch\nFor somebody\nIn power five conference that might have one last to play the conference championship game wins their conference championship but doesn't get in\nAnd who knows what if we ended up with\nFive undefeated teams\nLet's say you had either Alabama or LSU\nAnd then you had Oklahoma\nAnd then you have Ohio State\nAnd then you have cleanse it\nAnd then you have Notre Dame\nBoy wouldn't that be something\nAnd it's not to say that it can't happen\nWhen we've got a long way to go before we get there\nStill the fighting Irish have\nIt gets to none of the the team that was three no\nUh within our division that was a monster when force\nAnd hopefully I won't but hopefully we'll get to build on that this week uh\nWas hard game were playing the duck Saturday at nine o'clock in the morning so hopefully I Will be back in time for the start\nOf the UT OU game\nNow works out great for you I just I don't disagree with you I Would say about the quarterback play a when you look at the two quarterbacks between Texas A M and Kentucky with a Terry Wilson from the Wildcats and kill him on a from Texas ain't him\nFor me in mind I mean\nGoodness both these quarterbacks do for our quarterbacks I think mine is I actually overall probably\n... and it's hard for me to say I think a\n... who is more lethal in the path in game because Terry Wilson nice to talk and run it more\nBut for me if mine would just be smart about his play\nAnd stop trying to force the football and making Aaron throws you know it it is okay to throw the ball away\nAnd punt the football and lean on your defense\nThere's nothing wrong with that\nBut when you're giving teams\nExtra possessions\nLike they did against Alabama\nYou're not going to win the football games\nYou're not good enough to overcome that\nAnd for the second street game here to to pick last week\nThat gave me a dark you shouldn't have been that close\nGive the ball the tray beyond Williams huge are tied in\nWith those intermediate passes over the middle\nAnd if you have to throw it away on third down the only way\nYou've got a good distance\nGood morning walk on the box\nYou know I don't know where that teach Hebrew seems to think that we're gonna lose on on a Saturday or I obviously has been watching the Yankees play it's a different team I'm I Will say Texas shouldn't one last week they gave that game away ah\nYeah we had that game last week\nAnd tell them ... got some some growing pains to do\nBut you know let's look at the number of quarterbacks that didn't you move fishers putting the pros I'm pretty sure Jim of Fisher knows what the hell is doing and is it different aiming paid where we are the number five defense against the run\nAnd we're playing at home so Mr Chief tipper I don't know what you're talking about you you you must not be watching the egg yeah we have we we should have ruled Arkansas but we didn't every team isn't out the bad game we've also played the number one and number two teams in the nation\nI I don't see what Texas and you guys lost the\nWell Texas has their their well okay hold on time out here in Texas has been two teams that were ranked in the top twenty\nYou can't you can't just credit ...\n... what were those of us the look how good USC is\nI'm just tight they had they had a meeting to team they beat the St Pete he's not a good team\nUh they they haven't been there kind of fallen by the wayside if you haven't been paying attention\nI'm paying attention\nI'm just I don't know I Know they know they got to win the game top twenty opponent you cannot discredit what they've accomplished\nI'm not saying that they're better than I Am going to say they\nThey they'll do is written wins we're not we're not quality wins in that they didn't just he had he was a and M. beaten\nNorthwestern state and Louisiana Monroe\nYes okay so and and\nI Am a bad Arkansas team so I wouldn't be timely my horns is I Would\nI Would be willing to bet Arkansas could probably be the most at least half or two thirds of the teams in the big twelve\nTwo thirds of the teams in the big twelve\nYeah all the bad ones including Texas okay\nI mean I'm you know Texas is not that you guys seem to think you're back which are not by the way and now has the number one recruiting classes of the nation how's Texas doing\nI don't know how to make her look how are they doing\nThe night\nWell no but I thought Texas was was the savior\nOf the state I'm actually not\nI just you know it gets if I let you know I'm ... you know this is a different coach a name has you know yeah again we had a bad game against Arkansas but we when my son was how was how how well ... what was the the uh this\nBut we went by seven points how was how how well what was the the uh the score against with Texas winning last week ... what was at school\nIt was Nineteen fourteen\nOkay so whatever I mean that was the quality of when\nI mean we have one who said it was a quality when well\n... I'm not to de ... torn about bleeding Kansas state they almost blow it\nYeah and the damn sure did\nWhat they were just like you guys against Arkansas you won the game\nAnd that's all the county we won the game you weren't going to be absolutely we when we won by seven points\nAnd boys is more than three\nThey won by five ... years kicking in their\nTwenty nine or telling them for doing you're correct no Seventeen the for the it was nice I mean if you want to know it was\nTwenty ... twenty four seven\nSeventeen twenty four Seventeen look it up\nOh you mean Aggie game yeah he's only twenty four Seventeen\nYes you're saying Texas won by three points\nIn Texas they when they went by five yeah live what's the difference they won the game\nTexas is not as great as everyone seems to think they're not they're going to get rolled with when they get to the meat of their conference\nPlay Oklahoma this weekend what ... absolutely ... and\n... and and like you said how they how they call that game\nAt at seven and a half\nOklahomans can be winning that game about Twenty one and half time\nI mean ...\n... but I Will say this\nI Hope Texas breaks column raise legs\nWhy because he's a Heisman Trophy candidate now\nBecause she looks come back like his daddy\nWhen they're on him [laughter]\nI presented to go and I got some other calls that I Want to get to cause I'm running out of time you'd morning woke up in the press box\nWell Russell and heard I just got to say I just hope that are over there in College Station this weekend they have a whole lot of chalk to write those scores Kentucky piles up and show it to the dead puppies\nThey're afraid to go one more one more good morning welcome in the press box\nLegged yeah why you guys may I help me out\nI'm not going to be about as a um it's got to be a good game in College Station Kentucky is already gaining a a a terrible reputation as cheap shot late yeah so uh an average just got basically shy away\nFrom that I really think that one guy talking about the FISA fans like those fears your son football games as a [noise] I think he's delivered some some fan of the world I don't think there's a comparison to bring the quarterback fun I think about well I'm On\nA focus and in a in a much more positive than if you're making process or\nJust because of his track record I Hope so I just felt the worries about it I think a farm in light of it to five wins this year\nOr five points or something in the ... or so and I think I probably agree with a little bit of a masters or and I know this has got to be my ... glasses but a nine whereas in a big fight a crisis six or seven of us and the FCC ...\nI I I I Can't see that it's a lot cover conference no doubt about it hey amount of time I proceeded to call

American is but so are Democrats right\nSo we're Democrats [noise] and then\nSheila Jackson Lee and make sure that the left wing activists the cannon fodder if you will has all the information they need to go after and get in the faces of Republicans and their staff\nThey are now I don't know why for the life of me the Republican challenger to Sheila Jackson Lee one come in this program in and talk about the level of people that you hire on your staff\nThe caliber of people you hire on your staff and that it would\nChange should she ... district change to Republican how this kind of thing isn't likely to happen because Republicans\nHigher individuals who would never dream of putting a Democrats life or a Democrat staffers life in jeopardy should win a political battle\n... folks trust me I Know there there are Republicans out there that don't have the intestinal fortitude to do anything\nI mean even fight for what they believe\nThey they don't have the they don't have the\nThe ... if you will to even stand up for the principals they claim to stand for the very idea that they would go after a Democrat it's just I mean can you imagine Jeff Flake doing something like of course not Jeff Flake and barely dead barely knows what it is to be Republican much less do something\nThat would put a Democrats safety at risk but\nHold no such morality\nThey answered a no higher authority in their own minds other than their own political power in government government is their God you've heard her say this show is Sheila Jackson Lee district\nFlip to Republican you would see an instantaneous change of attitude no longer would it be acceptable to put a family's life at risk by outing\nBy out in the addresses of these all these politicians\nIt would it wouldn't be acceptable if it for any of the reason the golden rule which of course Democrats are not familiar with ... for those of you or Democrats or the audience allow me to expand on what the golden rule is you see do unto others as you have others do unto you\nSo those with moral clarity those with a conscience those with those with a higher standard will say gee I\nI don't think this is right to release the addresses and the private information of Republicans because what if a Republican did it to me what I like it when I like to have my family under threat\nThere is no such governor there is no such

I Am slow mixed\nI Am up beside myself at the opponent Sheila Jackson Lee wouldn't want to come on and say you know what Chris I Would have a staff\nThat would be honorable I Would have a staff that would never dream of doing this to the political opposition\nBut it seems that the current staff\nIn Texas district Eighteen congressional district Eighteen\nThey followed the ... the lead of their leader they have the same moral caliber they have the same ideas of the golden rule or lack there of as their leader in that office\nAnd because there is no Republican out there willing to stand up to guess what she used in is going to have to enjoy this cancer for another two years\nAnd who knows Sheila Jackson Lee staff may get somebody killed the next time it by the way to all your Democrats out there\nIs that a up is that a positive for you would you would you be more willing to go to the ballot box and vote for Sheila Jackson Lee if her leach lead to the death maybe of a Republican senator if one of her\nOne of Maxine Waters nut cases take that information leaked\nBy Sheila Jackson leaves office [noise]\nAnd goes and kills a Republican you don't like like the crazy man did on the on the baseball field I'm Out in Virginia shooting at them what would you guys be more apt and Sheila Jackson Lee district reelect her if she facilitated that [noise] just a question for all of you in Sheila Jackson Lee district [noise]\nDo I feel free to call up [noise] let me know what you think about a congresswoman who employs\nIndividuals in her ... fear they would do such a thing\nOf course all said oh show by the way miss Jackson lead singer opponent one come on you're You're welcome to come on the program anytime the voice of Texas A M seven hundred [noise] KFC [noise]\n\nTroublesome I Am [noise] my friends you never know how much a good night's sleep is going to mean to you until you're not getting one ... expert sheltered all back when you live oaks and there's a way to get a good night's sleep renew sleep number three sixty smart beds they help everybody from parents of pro athletes\nImprove their performance who are proven quality sleep houses done state of the art sleep technology and comfort adjust ability they call it the sleep number of folks\nMine is eighty five the wife is forty five we get to adjust the firmness of each side of the bed\nWhy we love it you can't afford a bad night's sleep close but you can't afford a sleek number bed coming out during the fall sale save one hundred dollars on the queen\nSweet number three sixty seat too smart bet now only eight hundred Ninety nine dollars sleet number is the official sleep and wellness partner of the NFL\nShould drop on by a sleep numbers store near you ... boulevard and mission at in the ... five forty five south next Ethan Allen and red lobster and the Galleria Houston level one next to Tom shopping Kona Grill\nDiscovered in France asleep never bet it's going to make in your life\nHeavier nervously numbers darn Zella Grisham Seattle's engine\nWhat's worse than the roost that link I resent leaks actually spent hundreds of dollars to inherit if you get the ... thing in contracting Houston's number one roofing and contracting company\nWe get calls all the time for people who are abused fly by night contractors to repair their storm damage they spend the day on the roof collect your money and you never hear from them again and the ...\nAnd they spend the day on the roof collect your money and you never hear from them again\nAnd the ... daily put yourself through that use the contractor with a verifiable history have experience has writhing in contracting a plus made by the BBC terrified mastery elite contractors when G.

only for conservatives only to stand would would blink twice and this kind of behavior now it probably will most likely will certainly come out of this\nNow it probably will most likely will certainly come out that this this young man was prompted by senior staff of Sheila Jackson Lee office to do what he did\nWas and I mean unless unless he's been paid off to to shut up and just take this don't

the\nLogging of the basket of biased press now Mr Ellison is the number two Democrat National Committee and Mr Allison is running for the attorney general very high profile position\nIn Minnesota Keith Ellison\nHas been unlike Kavanaugh has been credibly\nAccused of abuse verbal abuse and physical abuse the attorney for the victim alleged victim of Keith Ellison\nWait a minute that's right it's it's the Democrats America there is no such thing as alleged anymore just the accusation is enough to convict\nIm or just the accusation is enough to convict\nSo the victim of Keith Ellison\nHer attorney was on Fox and friends this morning because the attorney is saying and Keith Ellison victim and saying Democrats are trying to shut me up\nDemocrats aren't saying oh she shouldn't be believed Democrats aren't chanting we\nWere there were ...\nBy the way speaking of which did you see the disgrace at UT Austin did you see\nThese weights of skin as a pro Kavanaugh rally on UT Austin campus they were holding signs the intolerance tolerant left showed up\nAnd started ... by the way there's of course all said oh your Facebook page you want to see this disgusting display the shame that happened in Texas these leftists on campus shorted grabbing signs out of people's hands ripping them up\nJust ripping them up just for saying I support Brett Kavanaugh they hate and violence and these people these left wing extremists Democrats it knows no bounds how and they started chanting\nWe believe in ...\nOh yeah do you believe Keith Ellison survivors you mindless twitch\nDo you where are you where are you\nHere is the attorney on Fox News this morning\nCameras more caring my hands attorney Andrew Harper Antonio we learned that the FBI does not want investigate that has not their jurisdiction they whoa\nWait a minute wait a minute winning the FBI doesn't want to investigate women I I thought we were told ... everything oh wait a minute is not the jurisdiction that's right the local law enforcement out to stop what are we wait a minute where do I never actually right we said the same thing had happened in the capital accusations\nNo police report was filed to this day the first Kavanaugh's accuser the third Gavin argues or they haven't found anything in second Kevin off users not even\nNot even being talked about it anymore because it was so outrageously stupid\nThe third ... Michael ... client [laughter] she may be under criminal investigation herself\n\nFor perjury Oh yes she perjured herself\nTo which I say throw her worthless but in jail\nFor the maximum five years a small price to pay for trying to destroy a man's life one lives\nAnd so as easily Earhart and Fox News rightly points out the FBI can investigate because of the FBI jurisdiction is a bear so it has ... in Minnesota and by the way it is\nA local jurisdiction doesn't want investigating explain what the latest ends and will there be an investigation\nWell thank you for having me or whether there'll be an investigation or not\nAh it will be determined by others are Karen welcomes any investigation she has cooperated with every investigation and she will continue to cooperate with every investigation for her and this is about two things about her personal healing\nFrom a very damaging and victimizing relationship than she had for a number of years with Keith Ellison\nA bows emotional as well as physical abuse resulting or out of the relationship\nWhere ... where are you\nYou hypocrites\nAll of you idiots that showed up at UT Austin all you George Soros funded more on ... where are you\nWhere we ... oh\nThe lawyer wasn't done is to know any second near the finish second reason that she has raised this is is because ah [noise] she wants to\nShine a light to women can come out of the shadows behind that closed door who have been in abusive relationships and she wants to help that voice or be heard [laughter]\nAlyssa Milano uh we are you guys know the uh the idiot actress from Hollywood Alyssa Milano big anti gun nut now she's a big anti Trump whatever she showed up on Twitter yesterday and we called her out on this um she showed up on Twitter\nSaying of Bill Clinton hold on a minute I got to find the exact quote because I wouldn't want to take the Hollywood princess out of context a heritage\nAlyssa Milano you know well noted political analyst Bill Clinton I Love you so much like crazy amounts of love\n[laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nHey Alicia limited let ... let me confirmed for you I Love you too I Love ... I mean you talk about crazy amount of low uh I well let's talk about some crazy amounts of love you and me what we get together for dinner we'll talk about ... miles a lover right\n[noise] I uh I couldn't let that go I said\nNotice how the left wing lives and adores actual rapists and sexual predators bill and Harvey\nAre great pals was hardly good to you listen to the quote help your career did you love him quote crazy amounts to\n\n[noise] um\nI just had to put that in their pockets of these these more Ron's these freaks of nature\nBy the way speaking Keith Ellison he jumped on radio yesterday\nWas asked hey you're going to continue there at the Democratic National Committee you know\nI have been thinking about that I Am I'm starting to wonder whether I have you know I I you know I I've been evaluated that recently we'll see um I I Need to put a hundred percent of our current energy and resources into the race and into my office you know something that I'm I'm ...\nReally say a hundred percent of my time into the rate oh no no no no he said race sorry refund\nInto my office show live from the middle of a concern for the rich should want to put it like this though [noise] um I Will be a hundred and ten percent are for Minnesota range of time right time without feel uh and so that it's something that we're beginning to get right now\nYeah well yeah value weight away or let's\nHave you ever noticed that the stronger or the victims or are the ones that when I was in he's stronger politician so they make sure the Democratic party would chew are up are spread around you know what the first thing to do the first thing they do they go running strike the Fox news or something to get vengeance\nI mean their party doesn't even recognize him any more they're ousted and then they'll go straight to the Republicans to get some justice and not find that the most hypocritical thing in a world\nThat's ... that's a great observation I didn't consider that can humid and this woman can't get booked and her attorney can get both on NBC can't get both on CBS or CNN the blackout to protect Keith Ellison among the basket of bias prejudice in full effect and the only way you\nCan get your story out is to go to Fox News when you say that Keith Ellison the number two Democrat in the country abused me ... it's insane\nYes it is and I find it crazy 'cause I mean if you look at the history of ah other victims up from the Democratic party that goes straight to Republicans to do justice and they're they're the ones that are actively active against us because they think the Democrats are for democratic parties for victims for just\nRick ... says yeah again you took me right where I wanted to go what does that say about these claims from the left of believing survivors it seems that it's conservatives and Republicans are the ones you truly believe survivors real survivor was\nHonored situation whoever's the highest honor the food chain where when Democratic Party\nYeah and and then if you are high enough in the food chain you get Democrats like Hillary Clinton destroying you because you make credible accusations of rape and a\nAnd sexual impropriety against her husband a thank you very much for the call buddy I appreciate it Mike you're up next on a cell say don't show I'm Glad you went\nAnd Chris how're you doing this morning\nI'm doing well sure thank you for being here\nAs a native ... who managed to escape about thirty five years ago you know\nHe's the author and we'll get elected because the brain dead DFL up there they don't they're not Democrats democratic farmer labor party rather than DFL is what they call themselves so it's just ... themselves from just ordinary Democrats there there there are a little bit there are step above its\nWeight or a special kind of stupid which everyone had\nYeah yeah if you look at it that way too I mean there that that the brain dead liberal voter in Minnesota is just a shame if the brain dead liberal voter id in district ... eat\nA bowl give it says Democrat after their name on going to vote for him I don't care I mean he he literally could go out and kill somebody you'd probably still get elected because that's the mentality of the voters in Minnesota\nDo you want to know what happened ... with with this whole thing or that the national the Democratic National Committee kicked down the investigation to the Democrat Party inside of Minnesota and then the Oh yes the Minnesota Democrat Party hired investigator and the investigator investigated quote unquote\nAnd found that the user had noticed there was no clinical in the accuser\nAny investigator actually work for the law firm it works for the Democratic party\nI Know are they you know so I mean it's like you know ... ... they were expecting so many to find something on your own ... you know that's ridiculous coke\nBut wait I thought they believe survivor I'm Mike I thought they believed survivors I really did I thought only\nOnly after survivor was asked by a Republican\nOr I or allegedly\nOr if you got all allegedly a route Republican and you've got to remember that because that's the brain that's the brain the brain power of the DFL people in Minnesota [noise] date well hey just eight eight eight if it says he fell out there the guy's name oh we're going to let him because he's got to be better than that nasty all Republican\nMike thank you for the inside information the insight into what happens up there in Minnesota do I want by by by seven three eight to eight one five I can see the is the phone number here folks yeah\nI think that that's that should\nBe our our goal\nIn taxes is to stop that what I described as a special kind of stupid that's that seems to be

I mean I think that you know what the other the Kavanaugh has to pay the price for something that happened to this woman that may be able to somebody he\nKnew he has no earthly idea who she is he hasn't given her a\nA a thought he may have bumped into her but he can't remember anything now and she can't remember anything about the details of this incident either so she can't even remember she can't remember the details so there's nothing to investigate and I think that's what this report is going to show that's up there on in the Senate and at the White House\nThat these these allegations of hers\nAre at best uncorroborated at worst had been refuted by even one of her close friends\nSo I Do too much beer involved because you know oh nearly like beer or\nMake anybody a rapist does it ... I was ... ... ... [laughter] yeah so I Know it was a little\nMerges you would put in your lab little ... go with what you do to get it you were to put in life man everybody leaving the states you know that'd be great and I was young group ...\nWell I Know what you know there there's a there is a um a cart or another Khartoum at a picture out there\nThat's floating around and social media Mike and it's a picture of a little boy I mean he must be three years old or something and he's being held it it might be as mom might be somebody a friend she happens to be a Hooters waitresses any place since hand\nOn her breath at age three right uh and the ... the caption read this young man doesn't know it but he's just ruined his chances of being on the Supreme Court\nThis is how insane this whole discussion has been going back to a young man's high school years he drank beer so that means ... he's not so that means if you've ever had a drink in your life you're not you're not eligible to be on the Supreme Court\nNobody believes that and I think that's why the Democrats are seeing their whole sinking it's\nBecause they're basically attacking everybody in this country's ever had a beer everybody in this country who would get angry and having are being wrongly accused\nOf being falsely accused he's getting angry and everybody's with him and the Democrats are bashing him for getting angry at being falsely accused this was back firing tremendously on the Democratic\nOr this or do play a little on the little girl's Republicans right now they're not showing leadership to me the room is like a bunch of liquor and a bunch of gee it's for somebody to each other and we assume that you're sitting there watching to see what's going to happen but\nI'm like this is all involved a new way to get back to look for those ... or last week about ... jobs back to to the United states do those more important to me right now are you ... ... to ... go out with your goal makers I really do\nOh Kevin Oh no I mean that the only thing that gives me pause is flick\nI think that um I think\nThat Susan Collins is more of a man and Jeff flick to be honest with you [laughter]\nI have no I'm Sorry I just have no high opinion of the soon to be former senator who probably run as a Democrat in the next election cycle are from Arizona my great conversation men do me a stranger always appreciated Kathy Europe next year on the shelves they don't show let's say you\nHi Chris I just want to I tell you what it's like and to be a former liberal and\nTurn into a conservative I'd really yeah I\nI grew up in a democratic family that um the Democrat rates go way back probably back to Jefferson [laughter] and ah my grandfather who was a farmer actually told all his kids that anyone that became a Republican when the phone by now [laughter] so all his uh\nHis kids didn't touch fess up that they were publications after he died\nUntil after [laughter] by the way\nThat is the quickest way that is the quickest way to breed Republicans if you're a Democrat is to say it's because kids naturally rebel against their pay out of it that's that's an age so um that that happens all the time but go ahead continue your story I'm fascinated\nWhat happened to me was first ah I went to college and I I Love the fact that they're coming down on Kavanaugh about suppose it partying he did\nA when he was in high school because when I was in college ah hedonism really ruled and I I blame the Democrats the Democrats encouraged the free love no men do anything drink drink drink do drugs\nAnd now they're on the side of condemning people that maybe fell into that trap which I don't think he did and then on top of that so in my saga I ended up working for the Democrats on the Hastings impeachment staff\nWhoa really\nYeah when I was the lowly secretary and I started\nSeeing how the Democrats for the most part we're treating the lowly people on the staff yeah and it really I thought they were for that I thought they were for the little guy and they did not treat the little guy well well you know one or two\nSo let me get this straight you buy the food and now the government is telling you what you've got to do with your food\nWhat what happens if the food spoils can we throw it out then oh I don't know on on all the ... power that our got accomplished that might not accomplish that\nSo you add an expense for the businesses that they have to comply with the government out so you pay for the food it's yours in a free America you ought to be able to do whatever the hell with it you want\nBut here comes the city of Austin do gooder is in the city of Austin who say well you know what now you've got to ... you got to increase your expenses you got to come up you've got to pay somebody to come up with a damn diversion plant every single year and then and then you've got to come up with the extra expense\nTo deal with your your property that you bought your food in a way that we think is appropriate that we're not dealing with toxic waste here folks were dealing with food waste\n\nWhich is the most insane idea that I think I've heard from ... ... and ... you know what\nThat saying something\nAnd this this ordinance ought to be fought the attorney general the state of Texas at a ... you can see these restaurants to own that you can't tell them what to do\nWith that\nIf you if you want to increase your trash services go ahead increase your costs the pressure of his his\nBut I for the love of for the love of Pete\nI don't get this is this government's job
