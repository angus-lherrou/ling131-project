start just re camping here that\nThere are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formula to different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so has to be converted into vitamin D three ... three is the activated\nForm so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith my self and my family

everybody\nOr your bothered by temptations one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your person\nUnless you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems will solve any of them immediately but as I say with complete confidence\nMaking across of Christ your own ... change your whole outlook on life it would bring you enjoy relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give you got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be\nAnd that's pretty wonderful considering what God has got to work with and the case of most of us\nIt's a pretty wonderful all around that God send his son and he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul's would say to all of us price did not send me to see how many I could baptize but to proclaim that gospel\nAnd I have not done this by the ... of clever words\nFor I have no desire to Rob the cross stitch power the preaching of across is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in his dying where I was like to watch who are being safe from that gas it is nothing less than the power of God\nIt is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the Y. and the ... will I reject fucking city or what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world so foolish\nPart was after the world is wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all who wouldn't believe\nFight a simple mindedness of the gospel message\nFor the Jews ask for me right give us proof and the Greeks and these are actual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the entire ... all of us who are cold weather Jews are gentile\nIs Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology\nI'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us minutes greasing right Lutheran our ministries the rapid pace of technology has not slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm I'm middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine\nAt one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that and to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all the sudden the technological advances started they started to you know kind of multiplying and their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need\nAnd and now today you know\nHow it is kind of permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and then also brings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriately as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better [noise] that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point to notice is the right point or my way of saying here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than six hundred people who lived in my town but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can't assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand the technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change and as much as technology\nContinues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we reached that message each week you're on the program and that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity\nIs the goal post really never move [laughter] it's a gene is already kicked up all and and the game has been one [laughter] um and for us\nThe message is the same the message that the cause of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God he's here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he once you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic it's something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nAnd in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people got\nIn the kind of the beauty of it in almost a ... know duty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that save the world from soon\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times\nSon of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and on the other a technological platforms\nThe real question that we should be asking is how to God's Ears\nAnd God's scenes in jeans as our identity as him in him we have a diet and written with him and when he looks at as he sees through that death and resurrection of it's on and he loves it and he cares for any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message\nThat the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the why this person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem then you know so you think that okay\nFinn came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that\nGenes or in in that son of God and his sacrifice in somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in ... back to\nAny any kind of step back from an eagle while how that is not how I Would have thought about that that's that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is the gods solution for a problem that transcends our ability\nHey I'm seven hundred KFC the Houston [noise]\nPresident Trump has announced plans to withdraw\nThe

Saito thank you for being a conservative voice for Trump\nTo ... to make America great again on KFC and WBAI ... best wishes Donald J\nBecause he's a socialist only with other people's money not his own\n[laughter] that's a good point you know um look it's unsinkable\nThat a back bench member of Congress with no statewide profile could run for the United states as a Democrat and re sixty million dollars yeah I'm One of a sort of secrets um or maybe hidden facts about but to his fundraising is that he's been spending an enormous amount of money\nSo we all know that he raised a thirty eight million dollars last quarter that's from July first through a September thirtieth\nHe spent twenty nine million in that period of time twenty nine million of the thirty eight man he spent um and and of course to those months were in the summer when things wouldn't have been you wouldn't have been spending that much money if you go back one quarter before that he raised ten point six million dollars but he's spent six million\nHow's he doing it he's spending it on a lot of things um some of them are probably was expenditures a lot of them aren't and one of the things he's doing is she hired Bernie Sanders is\nFundraising consulting group revolution\nThat has helped him raise all this money on line nationally from liberal donors and so look some people are getting rich off that to work um he is as you said not going to be apparently giving money to other candidates\nOr he didn't fit the debate is going to spend all the money but he also said after the debate it wasn't going to go negative and we saw less than twenty four hours later he releases first negative TV ad which was already in the can so I look I agree with you use an empty suit [noise]\nUm ... this whole thing has been a fairy tale there's really not much there and ultimately he is going to learn that this is not a progressive state is going to learn the hard way\nYeah mad McCovey Ike our gas right now GOP consultant Washington Times telling us a let me ask you about you mentioned the down ballot races and it just seems to be the Democrats national strategy playing out in Texas\nIt's not that they are taking advantage of our last election under under a straight ticket voting right and the idea is to create a cult like following behind that vacuous\nA vanilla type Democrat left wing extremists from every Democrat in the state to take out not the folks at the top but the base on the Republican Party which is the down ballot folks the judges that state senators and state representative when you've got\nWhen you've got varieties mama and uh what's his name Eric Holder playing in a state representatives raised up in North Texas with Matt Rinaldi odd you know there's something up here\nYeah look I'm strictly a building in this election cycle I'm I don't think that that that the Republican Party leadership including the governor and legislators state party chair James Dickey would have\nSupported that are they not thought it was a good thing for the future of the state so this is the last election cycle will see that Democrats have always voted straight ticket statewide at a higher percentage than Republicans\nOne of the messages I think you're going to hear from God rabbit lieutenant governor Patrick and others over the next whatever it is Seventeen Days is that Republicans need to go straight ticket\nOr we got to match their straight ticket strength as much as we can uh generally we've been in the low sixties they've been in the high sixties in terms of percentages of straight ticket voting\nUm if if they do voted a higher level of straight ticket and for whatever reason Republicans voted a lower level that is going to affect down bell races look if you look across the state Chris you've got I don't know twenty or so really consequential races you have at least three competitive congressional races one of which is in Houston withdrawn cold as soon as you know I'm\nThe sessions race in Dallas is very very competitive and then we'll urgency Antonio has been for the past I think he's going to win a you've got two state Senate races that are pivotal as well as ... out in ... county and then ... and then the Don how finds in Dallas\nAnd then as you rightly pointed out you've got the road all the race and and probably nine or maybe even twelve more a state house races that could go either direction so down about stuff matters um it's going to matter in terms of hunter and published we haven't house how many centers we have we have the three ... majority we need to move legislation without democratic support\nOr you have a number of county wide races for for foreign countywide offices in urban counties in suburban counties so there's a lot of action this election cycle and I haven't even mentioned the judges when yeah right really important so\nUh you're right I mean the straight ticket factor is going to be one to watch 'em and that's one of the things that I was concerned about a couple of months ago that there might be three or five or even ten percent of Republicans\nWho are thinking about voting for about ... because they were falling falling for his spell I don't think that's the case you more think Kavanaugh has radicalized a lot of Republicans because we do not want to give Democrats any power so they can even go further than they did in trying to attack of this decent and good and an honest person\nYou took me right where I wanted to go because we pay them from Texas politics and how it all plays out nationally and you know this blue wave that's threatening to wipe out Texas is blue way that's threatening to wipe out America\nAnd it is really been diminished in my mind at least as far as pulling and showing and just your general feeling public perception let me go down the list here you've got Cory Booker out there saying that candidate does America better than Canada or any candidate as American better than America to\nSoak up ... with her DNA debacle that blew up in her face you've got the Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent standard you've got Democrats actually saying there's no presumption of innocence in America and people are ripostes even folks\nWho are moderate Democrats on their side are certainly persuadable independence how much do you believe the Democrats extremism is undermining their their blue wave\nIt's a great question and I think it will look I think they'd been extreme for the last year and a half at least\n... and I think it will look I think they've been extreme for the last year and a half at least a trumped range when syndrome is now something you can diagnose um but but it really didn't didn't catch on and get traction and become shorter undeniable to the public until the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd I don't even know if it was it was ridiculous paid or from the Democrats in the community as much as it was these protesters\nUm the rights to peacefully protest is one of the great things about America but you know you know sending a sending poisonous material to the U.S senator or publishing home addresses of US Senators or trying to break open ended the Supreme Court are all these ridiculous things thrown people out of restaurants\nUm that's not what most people believe is is fair and reasonable and right in America through and so to see the Democrats a break the confidentiality of Dr Ford for their own political purposes and then\nCreate these other two stories in a way to try to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh knock is I didn't like Brett Kavanaugh but because they were worried about the future of the Supreme Court roe versus Wade or to see them be willing to go to ... to ... to that yeah\nI think really woke a lot of people are looking ... scares me truly scares me the Democrats could have any control in every in any power in January to should scare everyone out there listening you guys ran out you've got to vote straight ticket Republican you got to help these candidates it's so crucial in so important\nI agree and we didn't even men we didn't get to a left wing violence going out and showing up to prayer marches and kicking the garbage out of conservatives Matt McCovey like everybody GOP consulting he is the host of the Mac on politics by cats are always appreciate the visit themselves they don't show Thanks Chris take care\nYou bet do I want my by my seven three I Do I Want five I make K.

Saturday morning two yeah\nOkay so I thought we were going to start having a real nice little cool front and it was going to be British in the morning and things are going to be really fun and everyone was going to walk around with jackets on it and just a great time it means that great because it's not hot anymore\nWhat happened\nAh [laughter]\nIt was kind of nice a few few mornings it lasted but then of course it got hot and muggy again and that's what it's doing today but that short lived now here we are in\nThe latter part of October and that can mean only one thing cold weather's coming and the leaves are going to start falling welcome\nEverybody to the back yard a radio program on Michael Miller and what we do here on the show is talk one on one with you about your swimming pools\nIf you have a question that matter what kind of question it might be you might want to ask about your automatic cool cleaner you might want to ask about your eat or\nWhat kind of filter is the best filter system for your swimming pool I Need to re clashed or my stomach pool what should I Do the number to call is to eight one\nWell what should I Do the number to call is to eight one five five eight five seven three eight and pound KFC is a free call on your horizon we open up the phone lines up early so we'll have plenty of time to talk today [noise] all\nRight nice little we got a little bit of a cool spelled coming in uh I noticed immediately I had a few more leaves in my trees\nA I mean my trees down or pay a ... leaves in my pool that much yet though they're all still stuck on the trees still but that is short lived\nBelieve me and a ... if you have\nTrees anywhere in your neighborhood even though you don't have them in your backyard guess what\nThey are going to find their way to your pool isn't that funny\nI mean it's not really funny but isn't it strange how you may not have a single tree in your backyard venue the leaves and your ... what the heck is that where that is because our pools are a leaf magnets\nAnd uh the lease love to go to your swimming pool just like do you do I mean can you blame them you know I mean you'll have to go swimming don't you will why wouldn't the dead leave love to go swim\nAbout maybe not but\nI got some great news coming out next weekend\nAt all seven area local Texan tools they are doing a full ... fall polaris of it fail\nAnd they're offering thirty percent off parts all they're all genuine polaris parts by the way which maintains the warranty or October twenty fifth which is next Thursday to October twenty eight which is next Sunday you know there are open seven days a week over there that that the Texan pools they have\nI'm I'm currently a disabled okay um and I go and I find that really I mean yeah I really got to get revved up and and if I knew that um it's basically all I can do that\nWhole yeah I got to know what what what was the plaster they put on that pool for your doc\nI'm you know it's pretty well ...\nOkay um it's a federal okay good that's good to hear all\nRight so here's what's going on you are still in the uh\nSort of the [noise] the curing phase of the plaster\nWhich means it's the ph is going to drift up more often than it did and and it's not going to get it settled as quickly uh so what's happening is you're not pouring enough acid in that pool at one time to really bring it down and have put get stable\nWhen you say you have a ph of eight point oh what is the alcohol entity reading on that ... do you remember that\nUm yeah at the top and the um acceptable um high on the edge of a hundred a hundred and twenty\nOkay All right so we have some breathing room there I'm ... and did they you know what that is it's not bad yeah\nOK okay good yeah we got to be careful of that\nSo first of all I'm you're at a gas it is not going to be bad for your swimming pool and improper dosages\nAnd especially on a pebble pool is going to help it keep it keep it looking really pretty\nYes it's not good to leave that that ph an eight point oh because not only does it it's not that you're going to use more chlorine necessarily what you will but the chlorine is no longer is almost Neal as far as being a killing aged anymore\nIt's about less than twenty five percent\nAn eight point oh and the killing ... where it down at seven point for it's about Seventy five percent\nI'm not sure so so yeah it is important we keep our ph down in the normal ranges which in your pool I Would recommend seven point for rather than seven point six because it's a pebble you want it to the it'll help to keep a the cinema tissues product you're literally ching out of that plaster\nFrom hazing over in causing them the um\nThe the plaster to get kind of a\nCreamy looking so uh I Would say how many gallons of water eases pool\nIt's sixteen thousand five\nOkay and if you have an eight point oh then don't be afraid to pour a whole gallons of acid in the deeper part of the pool\nAnd maybe even walking around you don't want to pour it directly on his steps or a bench but you want a port in that area make sure the pool is on it and circulating do you have automatic pool cleaner in the pool yeah to polaris\nOkay make sure that's running as well that'll help to get all that acid or a\nCirculated all throughout the pool quickly\nAnd so yeah it's sometimes if you're just pouring a little bit at a time then it'll rise itself back up now here's something else that I Want to tell you about it you might be interested in there is a product called protein Supreme plus\nThere is a product called protein Supreme plus\nAnd a it's a product we though you're in Crosby you're not that far from where we are we're in Pasadena and we do okay we do offer delivery service but ... but I'd love for you you have time to come by bring a water sample to my store in Pasadena Miller pools and we could airline out\nYou're not too far from that way I'm sure you\nKnow we're not we're about five minutes from the beltway that maybe two minutes um\nBut ... bring water samples to to my guide 'cause 'cause everybody I have in the store there all\nThey'd they'd been clean and pools repaired pools they they're long term pool guys we really understand the ... chemistry if I'm there I'll I'll come out and meet you as well\nBut the protein Supreme plus is a bore a water or harm a nicer meaning that when you put that in the pool it's going to make the water feel incredibly saw for you\nIs going to make a when your your hair and your skin is going to feel great but the great thing about it is it prevents algae from growing\nAnd when you get it in the right amounts a few ph is already locked in at seven point for it helps to maintain and keep that ph at that level for long periods of time\nSo it's really a great product for the swimming and it's really a great product for your ph which in turn makes your Corey work better and makes you pool safer in swimming\nOn definitely going to do that\nGood good you'll never really liked this product I have it in my own pool and had been using the ... for Fifteen Years or there are ...\nCan I ask you another question you bet you bet I got time okay this is kind of one of those well it all depends questions [laughter] I I don't expect that exact parents are okay but I you know what we've got a heater in the pool\nAt sixteen and a half thousand gallons and it's a forty thousand a four hundred thousand or\n... yes it's a big one yeah um yeah\nWhat the average cost to keep you don't you want to say Thanksgiving the pool up you've got people coming down from somewhere I'm what order of magnitude what does that cost ten dollars a hundred thousand\nNo it's it it's in the hundreds or maybe not that many okay here's the deal I was just talk to my friend Tom bloom and camp the good good buddy of mine pool builder and a consultant now [noise]\nUm he was saying that gas is six dollars an hour to run your heater those four hundred thousand dollar eighty four hundred thousand BTU heaters I'm eating my little right now I have a thirty thousand gallon Google twice the size of years so I ... I'm having to pay out a little bit more but I'm using my pool exercise every day\nAnd so it's worth the investment to me you're I used to have a pool your size sixteen five\nAnd I did the same thing with that pool um kept a warm ... uh I didn't hear all the time but I I Would do it for like Thanksgiving for like Christmas Time\nIt's not that bad a ... yes there are dependent depending upon the ... the the water temperature and the pool depending upon how cold it is outside depending upon how windy it is outside all of that can contribute to how long that heaters going to have to run to maintain the heat\nThe key is when you're going to heat the pool\nMake sure the pompous running twenty four seven because if your if your company's only running eight hours a day and it heats up during those eight hours guess what happens over the next ... sixteen values all that heat and when you when you can keep it going\nCost a little more electricity I'm sure you probably have a very low speed bump on that pool do you\nHave you know I haven't noticed any change in cost\nAlright buddy that'd be good um but I'm a\n... by keeping the pump running the heat or won't run that often once it reaches that temperature it's not going to run for hours and hours at a time it might run for five or ten minutes an hour so maintaining it is a lot cheaper\nSo let's say you want to start eating the pool on Tuesday evening so it'll be warm for Thanksgiving Day and you were going to keep it a war for the whole weekend then you know you might be looking at a little over a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty dollars\nA year and I could be off 'cause like you said it's at the ... and ... that the question to me that is a a an easy investment because you'd start thinking about entertaining people taking them out to dinner go into a movie or you know whatever you're going to spend probably more than that\nAnd of course having the sort of rule of your backyard well you already know how much fun that is\nWhat would your kids outside of the house\n[laughter] investment right absolutely absolutely my kids are all grown now but we still have family with the younger kids and we love to have him into sort of cool it is a lot more fun if you're really appreciate you hey doc when you ... you know I'm usually in the in the store in the afternoons\nSo he could come by around three o'clock I'm usually their loved me\nOkay I'll ask some questions about the corona beach bad\nOh ha ha ha ha ha [laughter] oh you you know the corona beach bad well yes I'll be glad what\nWell you know I tell a no no disrespect the Coronado beach but my favorite band used to be ... and Dave\nOh sure no I I I Love all the way to Dave [laughter]\nWe used we used to um black sure when he when he was playing a chance yeah on a ... going back we couldn't wait for him to get off the wall climbing and they were like\nYeah I talked to Dave just the other day and uh he's playing again and we're trying to cause I started playing with those guys\nI I started following them to just like you did and then I said yeah I got to get there and play with you all and then we started playing together and we wound up being at Sam's Place every Sunday night for like years back\nWhen Richmond area was fun\nIt was it was back then that was back in the late eighties\nYou and you can check out all the ... and that can tell in at ... dot com that's polite dot com with one L or on the\nPool lifestyle Facebook page and actually to well um and then they were talking about going on they lively spent a lot of time on stabilizing say I want to find out more information on that we have a website called V.
