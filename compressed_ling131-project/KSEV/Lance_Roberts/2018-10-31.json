along with LSU and the University of Texas is the only teams to have at least three wins\nAgainst top twenty five teams so far this season\nOr else you actually have four\nTop twenty five wins\nAnd it really does and the ... and the big picture it doesn't matter because\nLSU is playing Alabama this weekend this thing will play itself out as it for all of these teams\nBut was just a bit shocked to see LSU ahead of a an undefeated Notre Dame during that does have some big when the season including against\nThe fifth rank team on the college football playoff list\nThe Michigan Wolverine\nOr that being said\nThat was the reason why the big hits graduate from me\nEven though I was you do have a monster win over the six rank Georgia Bulldogs\nOklahoma comes in at number seven on the team that I

face\nAnd they all know where you got your start over at Fox News and they all know how much money you're making they want to get rid of the first chance you get so she tried to make this intellectual argument is meant man today\nIn twenty eight teen can we get beyond this and she failed to recognize the history of blackface\nAnd how it was used to demean people of color back in the day and the knowledge that she would have been safe but she did\nSo um\nAnd oh by the way not only that but you know who else has appeared in blackface and still working it has not been driven out of their job a Jimmy Kimmel\nSarah Silverman now she's an alleged comedian all yeah they've all been in blackface\nRobert Downey junior did it I think it was tropic Tropic Thunder Russell wasn't isn't isn't that where he played a black man\nWasn't that wasn't that the movie but we didn't we just make reference to that I don't I don't think he was in that one what ... what what was the one where he played a up a blackface soldier he was trying to be black\nYou remember the one I I thought it was Tropic Thunder but maybe not maybe not but at any rate all of these actors are held harmless\nAll of these so called comedians are held harmless Hillary Clinton held harmless beta or held harmless by the left his press by the unfair bias to press Megan Kelly\nOut on her ear so let me ask you all of you or\nDoes this change the way you look at the fairness of ABC NBC CBS CNN\nShould it should\nThere aren't new people there anymore applying equally standards their standards that to how they cover you depends on your political affiliation\nAnd that's wrong that's the definition of bias and I think you ought to take it out on your with your viewing habits\nUh\nLike I said Megan Kelly I think step in it because she failed to acknowledge the history of blackface and then put it in the context of hey\nThis is twenty Eighteen\nLet's let's get beyond that let's stop telling white kids they can have black people as they are heroes let's stop telling black kids they can't have white people as they're heroes and dress up like them as Halloween I understand the intellectual argument she was trying to make\nFusion pull it off very well and they were just looking for an excuse over at NBC to get rid of her and her millions that they were costing because she was building up resentment and it's sad but that's how it goes\nA numbers let me give you I'm going to read these on the votes on TV on how to read these off\nAnd twenty fourteen the midterm election the entire\nMid term election and twenty fourteen non non presidential\nFour point five million people had cast votes in the state of Texas four point five million\nWe had eclipse that my friends the entire\nVoting in twenty fourteen we've accomplished at an early voting in the state of Texas already\nWe're on page right now and twenty sixteen the presidential election sorry presidential election nine million Texans voted pretty good turnout right basically doubled what we had done in the previous mentor\nTwenty Eighteen were already on pace to be somewhere between six point one in six point five million voting in his mentor all ready on ...\nSo what does this mean this means that our efforts\nOn of course now say it'll show in the conservative movement and talk radio and and up many of our when I called thoroughbreds\nRunning in these races\nHave been effective at meeting the Democrats' strategy of trying to get Democrats to go out there and just mindlessly lively pull the lever for straight ticket Democrats were telling you to be strategic and thoughtful about it\nTo no one recognize while you're doing what you're doing they're just being told\nTo go for the regime is the beta and vote for every other Democrat because you know data whatever\nAnd we can simplify it for our side basically saying stop beta both straight ticket Republican vote straight ticket Republican is your best defense against the beta your best defense against that the hordes coming up north or it is your best defense\nOr against socialism against high taxes against low productivity against joblessness that's your best defense you're if you want to defend your family vote straight ticket Republican if you want to sacrifice your family for the good of government go ahead and vote Democrat go ahead\nBecause the Democrats have pledged to take more money out of your pocket away from your kitchen table they've pledged this they will do it I Believe them may have pledged to open up the borders and stick you with the tab so your children will have less so that foreign citizens children can have more\nYou all about that now I have no problem with doing that voluntarily going out and donating your hard earned money to charity that's great are you willing to let the Democrats do it on your behalf so they can continue to get elected that's a\nFundamental question do I want five eight seven three two one five I can see the Desmond is waiting hello does when\nI was at a uh it's not surprising how that go a very good\n... feet for January ... war heroes or Dan Crane show\n... who was running for ... plus\nOnly support fully support Mr crunch he's great man\nHe's running ... congressional district the reason I say that is because a lot of people don't understand that on the congressional I'm from the state Senate ... house district members was John [noise]\nUm [noise] oh the television and said look I go to the polls on the coasts as we can do that [noise] another interesting thing\nWell hold on before you go on from that point hold on\nA must be very plain the or the Democrat Party Desmond has put in\nIn Latinos to begin with so even if you don't like Trump have to believe that somehow the Democrats are going to be there to protect you from Trump that is not there because Latinos know increasingly that Democrats have let them down south now says about\nHow much did they did this factor into the to the other is that it did to me I was never a a a a ... shall we say of the Democratic party but I Can't imagine how the trail and twenty ten when residents Obama had super majorities in Congress and\nHe had pledged to to fix the immigration system and they they punted rather than ... and they chose to force socialized medicine down her throat rather than keep their obligation to the Latino community how\nMany of the the left leaning Latino actually remember that and and that's why they don't trust the Democrats\nThey remember that but it's on a scale from one to ten that's about to enter my trip to Democrats well why not what what what's really I'll say I'll tell you what's the ten yeah it wasn't bad enough that rock Obama broke his promise Latinos are used to like most Americans\nLike conservatives who vote for Republicans on the promise that you'll repair Obamacare and it doesn't happen yeah Americans are used to be like to do it all parties across the board I thought you know that's not knew\nWhat was new was it President Obama went further\nAt and he actually deported three million people most of the multi now\nAre separated by hundreds of thousands of family dumped kids in foster care\nLied about it and tried to blame the Republicans for it\nUh it was the it was that was part of the Obama enforcement agenda that really I think this illusion may look you know\nAnd and all those Democrats who never said anything at all Elizabeth Warren's who never cared at all of our family separation when it was being done by President Obama now are inflamed because it's being done by President Trump's oh let's see let's have ... seen through that they're not going to show up in big numbers to vote for Republicans but they may not show up at all\nI say All right the second piece you wrote was largely critical of a man that I called beta O'Rourke you also had a few choice words for Senator Ted Cruz but by and large your your your focus your input as was on this uh ineffectual congressman\nWho was pretending to be something he's not\nYet and I wrote in my piece that just went out today\nOr yesterday and starts appearing uh newspapers around the country today\nThat look I've lived in Texas for five years I look at it is crazy Senate race where you have someone ... who says call me Ted you have someone who was born Robert Francis ... who says no I'm Beth though nobody knows who they are nobody has the confidence to be just so they want to be and who they were born to be a and I'd plowed into that\nAnd what I what bothered me is that the ... you know and the Democrats will hammer endlessly Ted Cruz and see them about the fact that he goes by ten of the post Raphael\nA and a and the reasons for that but they give a pass\nTo Robert Francis overworked because he's a Democrat mhm another example of Democrats getting away with murder and they're held to a much lower standard ... Democrats on the Kurds in the Latino community so uh I thought it was crazy that nobody people have talked about his name before obviously this is not new I've been following\nThis issue from Texas publications for six months\nBut what what new was that Latinos would create a narrative to justify the fact that they were giving him\nA pass and the narrative and somehow that that old ... the people in El Paso the adopted him to like you know they affectionate love him so I called the bathroom [laughter] no no that's not what happened is nickname was giving him by his father who was a a county judge al Paso\nBecame the physically because he thought that if his son ever ran for office it would help and there was a cynical political ploy\nAh early on and it has remained that and I just I'm dumbfounded by Latinos have such low self esteem there were almost flattered that some white guy wants to build up you know this is terrific\n[laughter] well I Love it I I refuse\nTo give him is culturally appropriate name we call him beta we've called him Ronnie\nCalled and Robert Francis or work we've called on the socialist the socialist candidate for Senate in ... in the state of Texas but\nYeah there is I I have family members named ... and none of them look like Robert Francis\nOr Rourke Ruben now but I think junior high gas right now your votes on the personal they don't show the difference in my mind and you reminded me of this and in our phone conversation yesterday between ... Ted Cruz has been Ted Cruz forever I mean as he was coming up through school as he was coming up he's been Ted Cruz instead of Rafael cruise forever and heat but what\nWhat Mr O'Rourke did was calculated his name as change like I changed my underwear go ahead until the phone about that\nWill think about that one of the reasons the Elizabeth Warren story doesn't sit well with me and lots of other is because she went back and forth between identifying with Native American and as non Native American depending on what job she was applying for right or that that is not good into Raphael became ... high school\nAnd she said because he got tired of you know being teased over you know the short a version of Rafael what's the lethal it he didn't like being called this and this is al ... whatever\nSo he chose to the long way from fail but he went there um but he didn't go back to Rafael when the time came to apply to college as far as I Know right right uh so in this case with\nRobert Francis Aurora run for Senate by the way he was Robert friends that work on that I got this right he was born Robert Francis or a dad\nWhat Robert friends that work on is that I got this right he was born Robert Francis or a dad to nicknames invesco\nThinking this would benefit him later in a cynical ploy right a sort of the equivalent of not black face but brown face so we're in and make you a cycle you know because it may help you later right there and he goes to college as an undergraduate at Columbia something I Know about going to Ivy League school\nAnd he went there as Robert Francis and he said why didn't want to be known as Bethel at Columbia because the white people didn't know how to\nPronounce Beth though now granting that because every liberal and television I've seen are announces Bethel right ah I I I'll give them that but he he goes Robert ... is he comes back to our Paso\nAnd then he comes back though again I Am not so concern a poke at post pet and Beth though\nFor a this identity crisis issue but where I'm more concerned about is a cynical ploy ah where people pretend to be something they're not and Latinos except it from one cat it but not from another\nSurely because there's a director's name I think that's silly\nYeah Ruben Navarrette a junior ladies and gentlemen the most red Latino nationally syndicated columnist in our land we always appreciate his visits\nComing up next now he and I agreed largely on on this segment [laughter] we're gonna have to we're going to disagree coming up next birthright citizenship will get into that on the court said oh show here on the voice of Texas happy Halloween everybody we're right back [noise]\n\n\nSaturday Night that eight and ten\nRight here on seven hundred\nBoy on taxing\nIt Wednesday already Lanny hey ladies and gentlemen from bill advisor dot com joining us right now Lenny happy Halloween\nHey how're you doing my friend a happy Halloween to you too and in case you're wondering I've been called when are you all my life\nYou're not [laughter] that's good to no good to know you know and and I was going to ask you how many people are finding some extra treats and what and how many extra treats and their Halloween basket because they have made a good decision to go with Bill advisor dot com\nCertainly shouldn't streets of new tricks here are big three winners from your voice of Texas last week Chris from humble Twenty one hundred and fifty dollars on his home in auto insurance Michael from Richmond Nineteen hundred and eight dollars on home an auto insurance and then Matthew from uh Houston proper Fifteen hundred a little over Fifteen hundred on cell phones energy and satellite radio listened to everywhere\nThat thousands of dollars in savings ladies and gentlemen you just heard from casual listeners\nLet me tell you that is better than getting a full sized Snickers bar inside of your trick or treat back and it's so it's so easy to do you go to bill advisor dot com or you just catch the word go to two three two three two three G.

presidential election just like they're going to be worried every time around because they know that they don't represent the majority of Americans and the majority of tech and\nI'm at a couple quick points earlier I'll just knock them off real quick Shaun White it a snowboarder or\nThe full jak characters are Tropic Thunder played by Jack Black and uh the Robert Downey junior character where he's playing a black and he's actually a character in that movie and that character plays a black man so it's a character planners care here which is kind of\nA jak but it is I Try to ... entered it it is Tropic Thunder and say okay right it say okay to do that a post in case you're just tuning in when we talk about this this whole again the cultural appropriation warriors are out there only to to to to attack people they perceived as being on the right or they they got Megan Kelly fired from NBC\nAnd uh you got Shaun White out there that skate boarder who\nDressed up as a fictional character called simple jak from that same movie Tropic Thunder and of course that's a special needs person and he is being blasted he's now apologizing profusely it's just you know what I don't understand why individuals\nNeed to apologize but all these movie studios the left wing latest they do need to apologize for creating these characters that just my observation\nI take offense loaded right and I just wanted to bring up another thing and pop culture that I don't know people have been following it on the west and Kansas oh and starting up what they're calling up like that which is a play on a black exit a kind of like friends that\nAre which is basically walk away from the Democratic\nPlantation is a lot of the language that they've been using and the website that they've launched a is filled with\nA Youtube videos of historical um politician decaying contradicting the Joe Joe Biden and Jerry Brown sending away to Vietnamese refugees back in the day\nOr and you just contradict themselves nowadays arguing against I'm sending away the the the word that is on its way but uh it it's a great website and see the message that he has is\nUm stop talking about race if it's something that divides us or the more you focus on something the harder it is not to think about it so we concentrate on the things that bring us together and make a whole country then that's where we are going to focus on the target and not on off basically\nThat's where we're going to focus on the target a lot of fish and I I wholeheartedly [noise]\nWell that's you know and there's a similar way to put that it's of course don't say it'll show actually I'm the first step towards stopping racism and just stop being a racist and so many of these liberal policies are reciprocal racism\nTo make up for other perceive racism and again I I Believe all racism to stop a in this country uh affirmative action for example is his racism giving preferential treatment to somebody because of the color of skin in the definition\nOf racism buddy I appreciate the call thank you Peter for winning as long as you did Martin you're up next on the ... let's say you\nGrades I I've been waiting since Friday to tell you this\nSo I'm uh my wife called me and she's like oh did you see the ring I'm Out of who knocked on her door and I opened it\nAnd it would be a two female [noise] one of them looked like Britain though for the amount of uh I'm trying to support the uh uh uh uh probably my wife oh did you vote vote for veto or better whatever his name is um anyways so when I got home\nUm there was a paper on uh on one of my one of my vehicle that I purchased from California that I get on your on it um I open up a paper and it says you don't support people from California with\nThese people are nuts aren't they are the the assumptions they make oh you're from California oh you must be a socialist [noise]\nAh oh you're a Latino you must be a socialist a oh you're a Latino you must hate America or you just just like they do does I it's it's it's insane it is in St Martin and great story thank you very much and you know what nothing illustrates veteran my mind\nOn what we're fighting and who were fighting Mike you're up next year on the ground shelter into show what's going on\n\nYellow Mike hello are you to a group there are also thank you\nFor a yeah I was on the street from maybe carry out her what she you're a good amount of support group it was it was fair was she said what secret on the radar when she said that a\nSanta Claus was white white get over it and I think that it kinda like no real people the wrong way what she said it in the ... like nobody more yeah so it it kind of had it for parents or your kind of had to put herself she writes the age of the group a lot and\nShe cannot survive you know again I you understand what\nPeople who are watching horror conservatives would understand the context in which he was talking now what did she say about the ... who is she said was white Santa Claus was white which is a way to work with why wasn't why Jesus was a Hebrew and he he had tan skin [laughter] I mean so you're a you know yeah it was factually incorrect I think I remember when she said that\nAnd you you know again\n... ... what she was pushing back ... is this notion that if you're white you get to be pushed back up on if you're white you get to be discriminated against ... every every every day of the week somehow you are an a target that's what she was pushing back on\nAnd and many of us when she was on Fox would understand even though we've found her her commentary not exactly informed especially when you say Jesus was white come on and really um but Santa Claus certainly was was has been depicted that way\nAnd that's that's not already been set up close you know ... you know where you get it out there and how old is your\nYes she when she makes the argument about black face\nAbout in the modern era when you know and she was making the point in the context of a little white boy dressing up as Black Panther who was a cool superhero by the way\nDressing up as Black Panther Halloween the cultural appropriators out there going oh you can't do that you can't do that you know I Am in many of these an intelligent\nLeft wing ers are things that will conned as an actual as an actual country [laughter]\nThat was to vet oh what a little white you where the cost goes yeah is it is appropriate you know I I Would also goes along with that but I don't\nKnow that all those across to them but you know come on and it's something we we we would go over the top ... it'll take all that you like to do the are blaming are good some of them going the Trump but it is that those are all\nYou know he he apologized and it's a fairly apologized so they'll do doing like that because that's not his photo just individual over there at this point it is more what are you going to do anyway regardless of what was the president\nSo you you know just everybody to have the chance to go through you know a trouble in this country not just to do\nYou do it at the chance so just go look at like people just speak or do you everybody go too even though like or like they feel like they're just shows that people said well I feel like I'm chosen to go both ways\nBut you know the great man I Will be you'd go on and become cynical another four years ago the thing is going right to me\n[noise] yeah well thank you very much I appreciate the call and you know what it's it's nice to know or do you have more of a level head to the phones over to NBC and as we articulated earlier ... you're just joining us Megan Kelly was pushed out of NBC for [noise]\nMore reasons than John [noise]\nHer slip off on black face and again she could have guarded herself\nI basically acknowledging the history of blackface in America but then saying you know\nIt's time to move on [noise] it's time to move on [noise] um [noise]\nThere's you can knowledge the [noise]\nThe history of blackface and how would denigrate it people of color in the past and also say it's perfectly okay for a little white boy the black panther [noise]\nIf for Halloween [noise]\nShe way one time I made by seven three two one five I can see you found the course Saucedo show on the voice [noise]\nThat and I was drinking the cooler than\nI Am and I understand exactly what you're saying\nAnd and you know what a ... now you tell me a you're a black man you tell me the reception you got from from so called free thinking loving liberals\nAre in your former party when you said you know what I look at what the black community has wrought and what we have we have yielded from our devotion Democrat Party for the last forty or over the years when you start pointing out the poverty the the uh\nThe abortion clinic on every on every corner in your community when you were a poet stuff out or they what do they say to you what do they do or what\nIt is a Chris is with mine I wore off of the problem that you\nYou have committed you've committed a sin you've gone against liberal orthodoxy and you know Democrats like you won their plantation Leo and they don't want to let you off\nYeah and and that's the biggest problem I see ... I'll I'll I'll shoot you was just you know just this route you know whatever Martin Luther king bought for the I it took that and just\nPut us back on on on the plantation where we're just waiting for things you know sitting around now\n... she said what's actually going to be admitted as one of the administrators you've got Al Green out there and one of the administrators are basically trying to keep the black community impoverished independent\n... these people these people are sellouts or an I ... and you know what people like nearly all yes I I as your liberty loving Latino have said people like you\nDeserve so much gratitude from the Latino community because people like you have shown what undying devotion to the Celtic people known as Democrats went what yields for their community I'm bound and determined not to let the Latino community go down the same failed road that so many black people were led down and that has a lot of credit\nAs long as we think that America or something that is wrong when we were always being that mindset\nAmen brother was like oh I I appreciate it buddy you have a great day Russell you're up next year in the course they'll say that you have all the way\nHey Chris too great a interviews this morning\nAnd ... to your interview with Ruben this morning I have a ... it to me it's a small point but it's just great continually when Ruben refers to people as Hispanic or Latino is a race and makes a distinction with white\nAs you will know Latino in Hispanic or not races it could be cultures or or identifying by a common language or heritage\nAnd if anyone who knows anything about Latin America knows there are wide variety of cultures and\nThe three races are incorporated into all of those communities black a Caucasian or if you use the term I learned in anthropology model or Indian culture Chinese Asian if you will\nAnd I would suggest to Reuben and to you that you stand on your own two feet and let Ruben aspire to be the most red columnist\nNot the most ribs Latino called columns and as much as the alliteration of the liberal liberty loving Latino is clever Chris I I I never consider you\nAnything but an American and there's no need to play the let me know Hispanic card stand on your own two feet and be a great radio announcer former reporter intelligent man I did this\nThis fascination with remaining in a culture to agree self aggrandizing is is not becoming to anyone and it's very divisive\nOkay Russell you you've you've given me you give me a lot to chew on so let me just tell you why I Do what I Do with his mind illuminates you because first off the other side is busy doing exactly what you just articulated\nAnd they have set up these predicates which are accepted by the basket of bias press which are accepted by the Democrat Party and promulgated throughout the entire culture\nSo it is my intent and I and by the way I agree with you when I get up in the morning my the first thing I see in the mirror as an American not all at the you know the reason why I articulate\nLiberty loving Latino is to draw a distinction you and and the decision is this that there are loud mouth leftist Latinos out their Russell\nAre there are there are like the Castro the aptly named Castro brothers for example I have nothing in common with them other than my common humanity and Latino culture that that uh that I have in common with them they are leftist they're anti Americans\nAnd that the the illusion that has been promulgated in in the press and perpetuated the press is that at all of us think like they do open border left wing anti American nuts\nAnd I want to distinguish myself because I think by and millions of other Latino Americans are conservatives love this country loved the rule of law and love the constitution so I Am going to utilize the weapons that they have used a silence and bludgeon us\nFor the past two or three or four decades and I'm going to use those weapons against them\nAnd I'm going to do it until we reach your ultimate goal when everybody regard themselves as Americans I Will use the very tools that they have set aside to destroy this country and I will use it to destroy them\nNow if that makes me petty and your mind I'm I I'm Sorry but I Will not unilaterally disarm\nIn the face of an aggressive anti American enemy and they are my they are my ideological enemy I Will fight them with every bit of tool that I have because the stakes will ... if I lose\nThe stakes for my children in the future of this country could not be higher if I lose ... those who believe like me whether they be Latino black or white doesn't matter if the conservative movement loses we lose America\nDoes that make sense as to what drives me what inspires me\nChris thank you for listening to my talk\nIt drives me what inspires me Chris thank you for listening to talk and I use the word pity I didn't mean to accuse you\nKnow I I understand but does it does that does that make you understand a little bit more in any way where I'm coming from it\nCertainly does and I and I have to say I love the voting ... news\n[laughter] God Bless your Russell you don't look at it and as we say goodbye Russell you are\nIs where I think this country needs to be\nWhere we don't see black or white or Latino or Asian or anything like we just see American that's where we need to be so you're on the right place [noise]\nBut I'm going to use every weapon the left wing has used against us against them until we get there\nI Will not unilaterally disarm [noise] in the face of the most extremist anti American Left wing Democrat Party that I have seen in my lifetime [noise]\nThey could buddy I appreciate the call\nDo you want five eight by seven three I Do I Want five I make ... you got to sell the it'll show on the voice\n\nYour home dream I'm sort of on the radio and she actually read several hundred am\nBoy sort of this is Dan print draw retired Navy SEAL in Canada for U.S Congress I'm\nAsking for your vote today\nNot in a career politician but as a public service\nSo my whole life defending the constitution and that has not ended\nI Will fight to reduce our that
