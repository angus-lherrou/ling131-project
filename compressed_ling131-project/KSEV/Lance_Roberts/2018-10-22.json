states in gathering strength centered event in court is wholeheartedly supportive lieutenant governor Dan Patrick and his efforts to do whatever we can hear in the state of Texas to to stop and mitigate illegal immigration\nOr where do you stand on this and how would you do anything different than what senator Betancourt and the lieutenant governor is not\nA I'm a strong favor a secure borders I understand that immigration is not delegated to the federal government in the constitution\nIt is reserved to the states\nOr in so that we have a responsibility in the state government of Texas to protect the people that just from innovations and that's exactly what this is where I'm from a federal court\nIs that I Would introduce a bill and work very hard to cut off taxpayer services from the state of Texas in subdivisions to non citizens I think that would greatly increased\nRevenues we have blown out of the treasury allows to excess which is my my issue and the other difference with record\nOkay so now you're contending that ... illegal immigration despite the constitutional reference is ...\nSpending ... ... illegal immigration despite the constitutional reference is not the sole responsibility on the federal government\nOr the constitution says naturalization is delegated the federal government not immigration\nAnd but it but it hasn't been any better than the war to gain read several times\nOver the years more than a century ago the Supreme Court said well if it says natural station then immigration has to be in there too but that's not what it said the the ... if you recall and Seventeen Ninety eight the alien and sedition acts um we're part of that was the alien act which uh\nWhich was taken over immigration by the federal government and that's what Jefferson in Madison went against\nAnd despite in his mind Supreme Court rulings you you still believe that they're not in the final say on this\nI have a um a group called Alita created a group called Texas constitutional enforcement and we we know that the founders did not intend\nTo be ruled by the judiciary the Supreme Court is not a Supreme Ruler when we were an oath to the constitution

believe are you talking about introducing a bill or to to address\nIs this security issue in the state of Texas how would you convince the thirty other members of the Senate not to mention the more liberal house to vote your way\nOr as opposed to those ... those many headwinds that those who are currently serving have had to deal with like for example in the house of Strauss thankfully were rid of him but there are other people who in their elections as well have to be listening to do they not or how how do you plan on steam rolling them\nThe reason I left the Republican Party and came to

knock 'em out and then from all over the truck and\nYou know before they get there are I mean obviously they're not going to shoot 'em out but I mean what what would be one of the plan of action\nWell ... what are the well I I've heard the president wants to staff the border with personnel to catch anybody who comes on through a it's an all hands on deck approach that you're going to be stopped and turned around\nAnd you'll be stopped before you set foot on American soil so you can't trigger the asylum claim that's why the president's been putting so much pressure on Mexico to prevent this from happening but there's reversing through Mexico\nComing up here's where the United states for people who want to break into the United states recognizing the deficiencies in our system\nSo uh the whole idea is to stop them turn them around and send them back the other way\nSo with several miles within so I mean you have like I guess several layers of guard literally walls of guards there to stop 'em up and all that I'm\nI Am sure there was a contingency plan at least there should be on it because I I Know the U.S military has game plan for this eventuality should we ever have\nA a a war for example were individuals try to use uh the corruption in Mexico as a as opening up a new front on our southern border should we ever gotten into a war and I imagine a lot of those game plans need to be implemented now to stop these these human traffickers\nRight because I Know that they said that they couldn't identify quantities but there was definitely a a\nA well not definitely I've heard that ISIS was just arrested and spirited out of Honduras so that's raising questions about how many ISIS fighters were able to infiltrate this thing before they were rounded up\nYeah so uh so that that's the game that maybe that will go into within Mexico several miles that's why they said hey guys will go into it here but you know back off because we're just here to stop the uh the ...\nNow that's what I said need to happen mark but I I don't know that that President Trump has had that conversation yet with Mexico's current president and the incoming president saying look if you guys won't do it\nYou know we're we're going to have to and we're going to do it on your soil so a ... and again don't forget the narco traffic are smart don't want us down there they don't they don't want the U.S military down there they have a ... a headache enough with with the border patrol they don't want\nA guys with automatic weapons and I'm\nA a heck of a lot more firepower appointed their way to stop their drug trade or you know frankly a commercial regular commercial visit the agricultural business all the all the the shutdown and all of that food will be riding rotting in boxes and Mexico will lose millions of dollars [noise]\nIt's obviously it's in their interest in I guess even that are are you're saying it to their answers to try and stop that you won't filter or something to come into their country\nSure is I mean I mean the drug traffickers are probably putting up a lot of uh a lot of a\nPressure on to their uh their puppets that they control inside of the Mexican government but uh I I don't it doesn't seem like they're doing much at this point\nSo that's that's my observation I mean this thing they could have stopped it at their at their southern border but they didn't did you guys see the video over the weekend these these\nIllegal alien wannabes just busting through the barriers and Mexico said who would ever oh they way to them give them a sack lunch on the way so long as you're going to the United states that's cool\nCool with us um I don't know\nThat we can say that Mexico has turned into our friend on this one mark but I'm just game planning scenarios and what effect that hoard gets here not seven thousand but if it gets here you know eight nine ten thousand strong\nThere's going to need to be a serious response from the U.S military el ... what we're going to get [noise]\nIs more hordes\nOnce the world knows hey all you got to do is overload the system and the U.S is full of a bunch of pansies\nA bunch of Democrats\nWho want you there who want to fly to America and destroy America with a bunch of people\nAsking for entitlements\nA Mitch McConnell confronted in a restaurant being yelled at having his food taking them thrown out the front door\nThat the left wing as long as it's mind and and many credit Donald Trump for revealing who these people are do you did you have any conversations with him that that allows you to do to understand because he used to be a Democrat that he knew these people he knew their vulnerabilities is that what we're seeing play out here\nWith this president understand people first and foremost right ... good at reading people and understanding what motivates them and what we've seen from the mainstream media and more importantly now from the Democrats is their decision to incite violence we saw Eric Holder said when they go low we kick them in the head\nRight that's what they think is working and when the president talks about mobster versus jobs it hit home to a lot of people working\nToday and you know I saw here's the meals and the secretary of homeland security have to leave a restaurant I start your own Senator Ted Cruz yet on the line at a restaurant what he's trying to have dinner with his wife I've seen Sarah Huckabee Sanders has to be thrown out of a restaurant can you imagine\nIf for one second that was happening to Democrats the mainstream media would be calling on the president to stop this with Maxine Waters does it with the Democrats do it\nIt's okay remember Steve skill leaves the house with was shot and almost killed by a deranged lunatic who was a Bernie Sanders supporter who want it to kill Republicans\nYou know that almost gets no media coverage anymore and all they want to do what they want to talk about the president\nTrying to go after people but the truth is that Democrats are out of control they they\nTheir their desire now is they go to town they go to cities they throw rocks through windows they light cars on fire and they say this is our way of protesting the antifa thing it's all about mobs and and they are cowards to be fair OK Howard they wear these masks\nThey don't want to be seen and when you bring him into court they don't want to take a mass off\nAnd the reason being is because they are cowards and the American people know better\nYeah and you know what if we said we're we're going to make a decision here in Texas folks to send a help to the president or a hindrance to the president made or work will be a vote for the continuation of the moms of a vote for the continuation of the violence\nAnd the lack of ... and the lack of civility in this country on Donald Trump has kept promise after promise after Palmer scoring and you were with them in the very beginning could you give us some insight on what what drives the president to continue the to keep these promises\nAnd then if you if your couch it into what we're seeing with his now seven thousand strong hoard coming up this caravan up toward the U.S Mexico border through Mexico or another promise he has vowed to keep to stop this\nWell you're right and and Christmas you know a this president has outlined exactly what he's going to do on the campaign\nAnd if he became the president to filling those promises whether it's renegotiating the bad trade deals that we've seen bring back American hostages from overseas putting people back to work creating manufacturing jobs growing our economy at a rate that we haven't seen in generations he's made those promises kept those promises\nBut one of the most important promises that he has made that he will keep\nIs making sure we're keeping our citizens safe from all enemies foreign and domestic and that means protecting our southern border that means if he has to do if it is required he will send US military down there because of the words words of Ronald Reagan a country that doesn't control its borders is not a country at all\nUntil this president has been very very clear\nLook the people of Mexico can help us and he wants to have a good relationship with them but you can't allow what is now a seven thousand person caravan to just send merrily walk through our border think as in any other country Chris this were to happen can you imagine what happened to seven thousand people trying to cross the border in Israel\nAll the Iran or in Afghanistan China any other country it would not happen you know\nNow I hear you I I Am I Am right there with you I think the vast majority of the audiences as well Corey Lewandowski everybody American political strategist political commentator

wildly unpopular and the people are going to go into the polls to vote against Trump then why are these Democrats in the state of Texas\nTreated why they doing this uh\nOur conversation continued back when I wore a a different had a journalist hat I did a report on how they're our government checks for everything guys whether you're a proper age to vote whether you have a felony conviction whether you're sane enough to vote but there are no government checks\nFor your citizenship and the Democrats have been fighting the conservative movement on this tooth and nail and now we know why because of

asked you suffered the hands of an illegal alien rapist or if your job is taken by an illegal alien coming into the United states the Democrat Party says look\nI understand you're going to a lot of pain but what's really important as me getting elected that's what's really important and I need these illegal aliens to continue to vote to vote for entitlement\nSo I think so I can give the American people any illegal aliens scratch well I live high on the hog\nMaking a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year and sitting on my ... and doing nothing that's what that's what that's really what's important\nThe Democrat Party wants you to know so much so ladies and gentleman they'll ... they'll they'll they will steal balance of senior citizens\nFill them out send them back in for them they will\nBe in the Democratic party of taxes will fill out the citizenship box all ready checked and then send them to non citizens any illegal alien household\nSee how the system works isn't that

the law\nIt violated the ah that law that stops unwanted solicitations coming across and I don't I don't know that it does because I think political speech is protected\nFrom that but he's suing beta

to me when he doesn't get anywhere\nThe unflappable Mitch McConnell are saying please excuse me I'm just trying to have some dinner I understand you're passionate about this kind of thing you know in his typical mellow monotone voice and only angers the extreme as liberal even more\nAny extremist liberal takes his plate of food\nAnd throws it out the front door\nThe Democrat the liberal Democrat mob this is when you vote today ladies and gentleman you're going to vote you either keep these people in power or send a message\nNow did you guys catch Nancy Pelosi\nShe she said something rather

minority leader writes Carlos Garcia house minority leader Nancy Pelosi appeared stunned by allowed protesters who yelled and courage that her as she entered into a restaurant in Miami, Florida\nUm\nUnderstand that Nancy Pelosi just got through saying that there would be collateral damage against those Republicans who voted against her and her Democrat Party kind of echoing Hillary Clinton saying there'll be no civility until we win\nSo\nThey were individuals cursing at her and she was walking into a restaurant\nCalling or an F ing communist now I Do not agree with the mob mentality from our side in it but I understand this is where it's going to go\nIf we continue to put Democrats in charge if we continue to vote for Democrats this is this is inevitably where we'll go because human nature being what human nature is\nThese individuals on our side will finally get fed up and tired of being graded beaten up told oh we've got to be the civil ones while that the Democrats\nGet permission to be uncivil this is where it's headed you\nWon't be able to hold back the unity and then you know folks want it goes when when both sides give up on civility it's over the Democrats believe oh weakening as in civil as we want but you you Republicans must be statesman always and I got news for them\nIt'll get a lot worse than this as the Democrats beat up Republicans and Democrats show up in restaurants throwing people's food out driving Republicans at a restaurant things will get worse\nWhich is why we have observed at Maxine Waters and Sheila Jackson Lee her office there bringing on the civil war\nThere's only one way they can go if it's allowed to continue and the only thing that will stop it [noise]\nIs a\nMass repudiation of the Democratic party of about [noise]\nIndividuals who say even even some of these Democrats who have a conscience\n[noise] and I don't know how many of the water out [noise]\nTo non citizens' homes why is that okay\nAnd then tell
