[laughter] I'm Sorry\nTo cut your way to go on and on for spring training because the thing like the old days most manning land on the dark matter in shape\nI'm\nYour native or at least two weeks or at least twenty games off the regular season that why you don't have no games on the snow at the beginning and you don't wound up like this issue as\nWell that yeah I was almost always said you know how you start to see the mid to early March yes you'll hearts and cold game in in early March ... at some of these new there's no doubt about that you have them anyway when we started in April so what's the difference and uh you don't need to play\nThirty thirty five exhibition games\nBut access that they should play two weeks to get your your starters for starters\nYour grandma two weeks that's that's fourteen days before they stick shake him sixteen Seventeen weeks ... days so little over two and a half weeks but you still why start in March late April\n... take twenty games ... regular season and the the the word of it over with a couple of weeks ago\nThere were I mean it's just I just I got\nThis ... ignorant watching baseball where they're blowing code and that's just that's not that's not what are called ... and they played\nIt most of the summer boards your back board the summer but more than a lot of planning and what you're forty eight degrees or something like older than that I don't know what it was\nLike here tell me what you love to hear that scenario attacking the ball to come out of the huddle\nLiquid hock this far left the court or even in the little slot since other guy he or she or her\nBeard out explore up for the go\nOkay so we put for a ride on you're putting your left for tied in a lecture side all you're left side number in the back and you

specialist\nWell he's been a huge disappointment here I was there the return specialists\nAh and he's he has stepped in a albeit in a small role at this point or two to filament that slot receiver for the Texans in an emergency situation last week or ... and no doubt will be called upon to do so again this week or this to tonight against Miami um\nOne night game to send them to the world series and I wanted so bad that this\nYellow or orange Red Sox [laughter] but I keep thinking you know a minister's better than kind of my foot down to the red Sox beat the Astros for the on air going to end the Dodgers for zero though there are so it doesn't really\nCame off to Canada and I would probably put them both on top of just like you said it was hot\nAnd then they are I mean they're they're ... and the other thing from Boston too is that where they're getting it done [noise]\nNot only off into believe what they're getting it done defensively as well their starting pitching David Price he's had his struggles in his career over the over nine in in what ten ten starts ... and in the postseason in career has has pitch brilliantly pitch to great games against the Astros\nA hit in the individual round of the of the er I mean excuse me they all the up and then last night to going six wrong ... giving up just to runs in three hits\nA in picking up the win for the red Sox last night in starting pitching has been great Nathan of all the ... that that great going to be had against the Astros as well they're they're starting pitching has been spot on a as well as the red hot hitting\nSerious serious mo Jo I mean that\nI Do catch a you know whatever game for whatever the left field or made on bugging them I mean I got to make that can start to a different game you know price was supposed to come in and you know he's warming up the night before are supposed to come in and they said we're gonna we're gonna watch in pitch by page\nMaybe an ending maybe two maybe three I don't know what do you go five to seven some yeah there are looking on but like five or six yeah everything's working on those guys uh I just wanted to comment also the other day said a\nShort baseball season

way to do that on some one fifty four to one or two it was a really positive for some chance over them but I Do agree with shorts on\nStrong smuggling something or yeah or there's that's overkill I I

there's no way that\nThe baseball season whatever short and that's just a I'm a fellow baseball first and I hate to be age but you know if it was what it is a little but hey look it up to the Milwaukee Brewers a switch with the Astros moving that's another story but\nYou know ... ... that's just not going to change the status of the house as far as soon as that forcing it on\nThe money in baseball the agents you know X amount of starts X amount of things and that's just the ever change that I couldn't see it I mean I wouldn't say it's just not apps\nAnd uh I gave the Americans that's going to be a tough game I\nHope they stop at a photo Patterson or whatever the Fitzgerald I get that sort of mixed up one of them\nWhat it is it's Fitzgerald\nIs Gerald Paterson I went to Michigan

it to keep your family safe\nTo send a message to the Democrat Party that the violence that we've seen the overwhelming violence and rhetoric anti American rhetoric that we've seen the last two years will not win the election is developed straight ticket Republicans do not reward them for what we have seen and where we are today\nRegardless of whoever's responsible what their motivation is the reason why we have bombs so called bombs being mailed out to Clinton holder Brennan over at CNN all CNN drama queens\nCNN or Russia was telling me I don't watch frankly Russell as telling me I'll

caught regardless of their motivation now well this play out in the midterms I don't think so\nI don't think so because to me it just reinforces why I had to vote the way I voted\nAnd I'm sure there are like people like Cuomo liberals who will be encouraging people to vote who already predisposed to hate Donald Trump in predisposed to hate or Republicans it'll just drive them to the polls so I think these incidents\nWill just further polarize America further drive people on both sides but polls I\nThink it's going to be a net wash and it's not the point the political aspects of the point but it's where Hillary when Hillary went there yesterday\nShe thanked the secret service she said we've got to come together just like President Trump did then she said then we've\nGot to vote Hillary Clinton no better than the me\nDonald Trump the president of the United states took the high road pledge the full resources to stop it's unacceptable behavior and whoever's doing this it's unacceptable let's let's be clear about that\nBut what I Want all of you and tell me is where do you think this is all coming from\nWhat is the scenario playing out here do you think this is something\nConcocted and put into place\nBy the left wing to gin up sympathy to say well yeah for the last two years we've been kicking the garbage out of Republicans yeah it's true but see their justice violent and and giving an excuse for them and say oh yeah everybody does it just like they did with the Mueller investigation remember remember the moment investigation was about\nRussia collusion with the Democrats have been doing during the entire time of Obama in the oval office collusion\nSo that the best thing they could do is throw up smoke and say we'll see Republicans do it to you can't prosecute us for it\nIs this a case of that some left wing or somewhere coming up with all of this to say to Republicans were violent too is that what's playing out here or is it someone do you think it's someone\nWho has been pushed too far to years of violence two years of living in fear two years of being told well yes the Democrat hordes or here you're just gonna have to accept them\nAnd by the way they get to perpetrate there they get to perpetrate violence with stand down orders from left wing mayors nobody's going to be there to protect you\nOr they can show up on the ...

Russia was telling me about the courage of left wing of Russia was having a conversation apparently off the air with a with a paragon of courage who was trying to give Israel that the Republicans are just the wrong way to go for so blind to Republicans\nNow you know what I I I'm not blind to Republicans but I'm certainly not blind to you Democrats and liberal extreme it's either\nI mean now this paragon of courage just left wing zealots\nWe didn't want to come on the air and and he just wanted to to light up Russell Cheryl Z here thankfully you all were spared from that because in typical fashion our political opposition lacks the courage to cite anything that backs up their assertion\nDo you know why\nDo you know why they don't come on a conservative talk well I shouldn't say this show probably more than any other conservative talk show entertains the left wing and engages the left wing and allows them to have their say\nOther talk show hosts just don't even they they get on the air and they got to lie to get on the air and once they get on the air that they're the conservative talk show host doesn't engage them to shut them down when we engage and we try to have a

fingerprints on it and\nThey want to undermine your rights and your liberties your security but they don't want you know who they are and they can't articulate\nThe reasons why you must give up your rights and your liberties for your own good because it bottom here's the reason why\nThey just want and they think they deserve power that's all\nAt bottom every single Democrat who is running for office Sikhs power and to tell you what to do with your life that's it and all the people that vote for them seek to give that power to somebody they perceived smarter than them\nTo run their lives so they have no responsibility over their lives\nThat's the caliber of individual we're dealing with did a wrestled to the individual was calling it happened to give their name\nNow okay well\nAgain that's the kind of person that probably wouldn't enlightened knew any way that doesn't have the the intellectual\nFortitude or the brain cells to put into words why I think liberalism is great\nWhy I

conservatism is the best way to go I\nCan also tell you why Republicans don't live up to that conservatism but right now ladies and gentlemen I Want you to know with a bomb scare what's going on right now our best defense in my opinion is devote straight ticket Republican\nBecause which every scenario that we laid out and for those if he was getting up and hitting a snooze on the alarm clock let me go over the scenarios again\nAs you all know we had so called bombs\nBeing ... none of detonated and we don't know for sure as to whether or not they were ever designed to be detonated some people observed to me yesterday that\nThere's a timer a timer on one of these bombs how do you set a timer on a bomb that you send through the mail and by the way the U.S postal service I Am told is that process these high profile packages they send them in secret service for processing\nWhen they go to Obama when they go to Clinton and other former officials\nSo today we wake up we wake up to Robert De Niro another anti American leftist receiving a package of one of his restaurant's one of his employees fighting so we're going we're going to get this from the next couple of days folks and the scenarios are are as follows\nThe left wing fails cabinet they failed with the the horde coming up they failed with all of their violence in their rhetoric on their intimidation tactics for the last two years as a matter of fact all of those backfired so much\nThat these so called blue wave has been slashed\nThat Kavanaugh hearings in particular backfired on the Democrats so badly that there was a a resurgence of the Republican Party\nAnd the narrative don't forget Donald Trump put the final nail in the coffin I Believe all the Democrat blue wave when he said Democrats are about mobs

look the right wing or is there a violin just like us vote for Democrats or where there's really no difference um and they're all of course the Democrats are also blaming the president for all of this\nAfter two years Donald Trump says what's your get punished that guy in the nose during a campaign event and one guy lays out a left wing protester during a campaign of it and that is equal to all of the violence and malfeasance we have seen from the left wing of the law\nAll of the violence and malfeasance we have seen from the left wing of the last two years from the shameful rhetoric of Hillary Clinton Eric Holder Maxine Waters pretty despicable actions have Sheila Jackson leaves office in releasing\nThe information the addresses of Republicans from the shooting by liberal nut

it for those write in a moment or access to them to America to a little bit ... that's the way they would have to pay or how these people right I Want to why nobody asked that question\nWe were hearing wait a minute wait a minute when did you hear yesterday da chest came out and verified that they have identified in the horde\nAre individuals who are known felons known criminals known dangers along with cartel members and they can't rule out and many of them speculate because they're they're trying having a hard time identifying them\nBut because Hondurans themselves had abducted ISIS fighters in on doing is that ISIS has actually infiltrated the horde as well\nYes I heard that but what I Want to know did they released it when they come from the opening of the shale and let him out of there so bent on coming to America although there are bills are being paid I don't want to stay in that country\nOr something yeah you know among the or they don't want to stay\nAnd did you did you see the video of payments being made there they're handing out cash to these people so I Know that ... that's a big motivator read that you Gary you're right man this is all this is also serving as a distraction from something that's hurting the Democrats which is the illegal alien caravan which we're told\nWill get access to the United states did you see William ... reporting down there and say he said seven thousand fourteen thousand whatever the number is by the time they reach America They're going to get in if past is prologue\nUnless Donald Trump does something unless the

crime do you know as so many of these people are coming across the border illegally than the criminal element is coming in as well\nThe double standard the loss of presumption of innocence the\nWhat the Obama administration got away with the Trump Administration is having to deal with it having charges fabricated against them\nIt's\nIt's the the ... the violence in our streets that Republicans are saying well you just got to sit there and get beaten up\nThat's your job that's how you show your statesman like this there can only be pushing so far\nAnd there is a scenario where this guy or dies or gals said we've been pushed to far we've got to leave room for that scenario until we know more my gut tells me that's not the case\nMy gut tells me that our side knows the political stakes and we go down this road it's the end of America\nI think it's more plausible this is a left wing or left wing attempts to change the conversation my gut tells me it could be an external left wing

Virginia area I grew up just across the mountains and\nI went to a school called Robert elite high school and they should have just a part of society down there and you're absolutely right the whole thing began as protection of history that's what all the flood it got picked up and he railed and\nThat's what happened um so for first of all there are ... you know zero people like that and the area um anyway second point is it leads right into that that what we're seeing these bombs uh they're false flags I mean the timing of it\nAll of these things if you look back historically across let's just said about three years every dramatic thing that's happened in politics or that had an influence on politics\nCan be traced back or becomes inconclusive as to who exactly did it but it always leads back somehow to the left and that's all I Want to point out with this is one for the last time we actually heard about a credible attack from a right wing or that was of this scale I Can't remember one\nNo I Can't either I mean I guess if you want to call Timothy McVeigh a a right winger I suppose the Oklahoma City bombing and what and what what happened there but I mean I Can't like stretch but\nYeah it was more yeah well he was more of an anarchist than a than a than a conservative and of course conservatives are primarily a fixed and here in to the to the constitution which was

there supporting them right or they don't they don't fly under the banner of black lives matter as soon as this individual did up in Dallas\nSo in one member of the group which is the way it used to
