I'm sure once you get to the game ... and you're in the stadium and he said the cowboy fans area it might take it on\nA ... a bit of that a bit of that old rivalry feel\nBut let's face it these two teams have not done anything in the NFL to garner\nThe respect to to the degree of that kind of hatred word you know you start rag and all of them are just it just doesn't because he two teams haven't done anything\nAnd the Texans certainly haven't been here in the cowboys who were fortunate to get a win last week as well just as equally as the Texans were\nBut gets a bad football team in the forty niners\nI'm excuse me for the job was to give the Detroit Lions so you know\nIt just doesn't have that that same field for me like it used to ... or you know more so I guess when it with the cowboys in the Oilers\nAnd I'm just going to be a tough tough so the Texans pay at home we know the all the history of the Texas on prime time they don't play will and prime time when the lights come on a they fade away\nThey are not good\nFact they're abysmal their record I I\nLost it here but it's not\nBecause look at how much about what I say oh you have an effect\nOn what it is that just tells you after a while I'm\nListening when he when he spoke and said he dialed in ... even when he was in Cleveland and they in the garbage years in Cleveland has been good that he went through with with the Cleveland Browns when he was dialed in and healthy and was focused in his mind right he was incredible he was unstoppable\nThat's why you know Cleveland stuck with him for so long because they knew what kind of a talent he could be\nAnd why they gave him chance after chance after chance because they they did not want to lose that kind of talent on their roster and and you know now that he's in New England maybe they can keep its head on straight hours or I might be willing to especially we giving with uh the rookie running backs Sony Michel ... and James wider running back\nA would determine if they can stay healthy it might be one of their better often says one of their better teams I Can't say that because defensively [noise] they got issues on the defensive side of the ball does New England they do yeah\nI understand that but when I was talking to some of the car\nTo intercept Stillwater yep we have a four part\nWhich is a reason why a lot of people feel like now the original reason why a lot of people feel like the only team that\nReally has a shot at knocking off the pay the patriots this year is it seemed like the Jacksonville Jaguars because their defense I can put that press coverage on you and they can also get after you're on the quarterback and shut down those those those short intermediate quick passing lanes are like we saw them doing A.C Thompson game last year\nUh we've seen that before I out of the jaguars and they've already beaten down the patriots this year in Jacksonville so are they are a team that that could be a threat they only kill you feel there is it's which Blake morals will show up\nAnd it was like oh\nYeah there are markets Lawrence or not the right\nAh yeah I think so I don't remember his number on top of my head\nThat guy that guy that all that stuff that sooner or later and stuff\nSo yeah oh I Know it's trust me I Know it's their lives and he's not the only guy that can bring the pressure either listen there there's there's not ... on that roster from the Dallas Cowboys\nHey I appreciate the call to a one five five eight five seven three eight\nThen you're going to have to start out fast and really can they hold it do to ... and we've seen kind of both in instances happen there for the Texans\nI but we'll see yeah the patriots last night or getting the job done and get the Indianapolis Colts thirty eight to twenty four the two teams combined for twenty eight points in fourth quarter resort to touchdowns were Indianapolis I actually made this game it'll twenty four and a three\nAnd a half and newly er Indianapolis would score\nExcuse me the fourteenth on extra points\nTo actually pull it within twenty four Seventeen\nOpposite Andrew Luck would give the ball away again and the patriots which for two more times or to seal the deal the culprit scored another touchdown late or in garbage in garbage time\n[noise] but in the end it's Tom Brady who through for three hundred forty one yard three touchdowns the too big that neither one of them were his fault as they both came out of the receiver Santa Cruz Hogan and Rob Bryn ... the last night and Andrew Luck who did\nSlides indicted sense that patriot second is what I'm saying there there are some deficiencies there in New England armor they their defense is not not nearly as good and you could contribute a lot of that to the fact that map Patricia there is no longer there are decent the coordinator\n... pass for three hundred and sixty five yards and three touchdowns fifty nine pounds attempts that showed her a major luck obviously feels pretty good right now\nAnd then coming onshore we're going through a bunch of patches last week against the Texans as well excuse me\nI'm a big win for the patriots now they get ten days prepare

gaps\nIn the voting numbers have the gap has gone and we're seeing not only will we keep the Senate which that was never in in jeopardy in my mind\nBut but the house races are tightening up quite a bit and and this is this is simply because while the media has put a great significance and a large portion of the coverage\nOn the protests and rallies and sit in here in Washington DC the heart and soul of the American people across this country you see many of them at these Trump rallies they they are mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore\nAnd watch her yeah in the end for them

is the consequence of Democrats who were asleep at the wheel on not just nominating the wrong person but not putting an emphasis on the extreme extreme value of the Supreme Court nomination\nDonald Trump did a lot of the Republicans did for that matter but Donald Trump\nNot only a promise to have ... justice was on the Supreme Court gave out a list of qualified incompetent nominees to make it to the Supreme Court and this is why he was one of the many reasons to be honest Christmas was that the number one reason for me as a conservative was the Supreme Court\nTo have justice is just like Neil

what to what their core being is their core being as ruling\nTheir core being as force their core being is I'm smarter than everybody else out there so I'm going to do either me or I'm going to vote for people who want to control everything 'cause that's the superior way to go this is the age old debate we had been treated too in human history Spencer\nAnd it was where they serve it says I Will not be ruled where the liberal says I Want to rule you and that's where the conflict comes\nRight and that's why they lost so much because they know that she will follow the constitution which is ... named tools to coach\nThe touch afford to have not all they have to do with in in the courts is persuade you know five people that's it and they get their way up when you put it up to uh the\nGeneral
