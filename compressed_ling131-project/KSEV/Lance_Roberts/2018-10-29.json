expected and says I suspect arrested and is that as a bombshell suspect outspoken supporter from the headlines on the Washington Post and I went back and looked at the post from\nLast year after Bernie Sanders supporter attack of Republican baseball practice was severely wounded staged glaze no headline there about outspoken supporter of standards so I guess the question is is it fair to draw that kind of Lincoln front page shops fact outspoken supporter of Donald Trump's\nOkay there's Chris Wallace awakening the fact that there is a Democrat a liberal bias in the press\nAnd he he you hurt and he said he was shocked he was shocked to see this level of level of animosity toward the president toward Republicans tore conservatives and of course you when I deal with this every single day then later on in the interview\nLater on this panel Chris Wallace undermines his own argument by insisting that somehow Donald Trump is contributing to this to this atmosphere\nBecause it didn't seem this week 'cause if there were two presidents first of all there was a teleprompter Trump let's take a look\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America come out whether or not I don't [laughter] and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBut then there was Twitter Trump here he is a free fourteen am friday morning and\nAs if that makes a difference maybe doesn't require a lot of sleep he is he is an older gentleman as you we get older we require less and less sleep the fact is that the three fourteen in the morning is says exactly what\nWell why is that your main or important which should be asleep maybe maybe he's driven Chris Wallace maybe you've got to bed early maybe maybe he's an early riser\nI actually kind of think it's nice to know my presidents up at three fourteen in the morning\nGetting to work working on my behalf\nFunny how lonely right on CNN and others can criticize me well even blaming me from the current state of bombs yeah when I criticize them\nEven blaming me from the current state of bombs yeah when I criticize them go wild and scream it's just not presidential do you think it's fair to say that there were two very different presidential towns here\nThat's no I don't know where where where Chris Wallace is coming from he acknowledges\nThat the unfair treatment the Trump gets from the press when Trump calls him out then of course well us as well it's one thing for me as a journalist to call out the press something for you Mr President you should be able to do it\nI I don't understand his his point was to different ... she's a\nOn one hand he's saying that we there's no there's no room for political violence and then and then he turns around and blamed the press last time I checked Chris swallowed the press wasn't supposed to be\nPolitical unless you're willing to to admit to me now Mr Wallace and that they are because we all know they are\nBut I don't understand this this motive criticism from Chris Wallace\nJason Riley had one of the best response is I think\nThat really slam dunk this whole argument the reason why Donald Trump is up at three fourteen in the morning is to counter a message that is being put out by what Chris Wallace already admitted to an unfair press\nIf you want to know why Trump won't give up a Twitter and social media that is why that headline is alive [laughter]\nHe does not trust the mainstream media to treat him fairly and he is going to continue to use social media so long as the mainstream media treats them in that fashion and his supporters are going to appreciate has his of social media I think that as an exhibit a right there [laughter]\nNo kidding and why shouldn't he this is why I you know my only caviar with Trump's use of social media is when it steps on his own message otherwise go for it otherwise it is your direct link to we the people\nAnd he ought not be ashamed of it and as Jason rally points out because you can't rely on fair coverage for the basket of biased press it's essential\nYeah I I and the the other ... nobody was killed in the bombing in in a bombing incidents and we don't know whether or not these these devices were actually meant to go on my but I Know but\nStill the president is they're trying to a thousand leaders of our our our I think I don't know if the federal laws that allow or that's my personal opinion I Know they weren't killed by the worst that go up and they weren't hoaxes and they weren't there to assassinate leaders\nYeah you know what I think I think at the very least life life in prison would be appropriate because each ... each person what we had a total of ten bombs each individual he sent in each person the imperiled I think that should be a separate charge I mean this guy's this guy's going to get the book thrown at him and I and I and I hope it does\nI don't want to waste our tax dollars putting in Britain I Want to let him do that but why do you\nThink that that's a that's a that's\nA good point you know one whenever somebody talk to me about the expense of of housing and feeding and caring for these individuals I mean let's let's let's not mince words what this guy did was a direct attack on our on our democracy on a Republican\nExactly well let me let me say this about the media because you made a really good point it is true that our constitution guarantees the press the freedom to report but that is not immunize them against criticism\nFrom of course not of course it does it\nAnd that's what they think they think because they have the second they had the first amendment right to be with a friend that the that the media today believes that Indian address them from criticism\nAnd sang by the way can I make it at your home and tell the story about what I did with the Democrat morning news\nI mean they had a reporter that had done a story and this was a couple of years ago and I remember calling up to the the editor of the paper the time it was a female and I said I like to have your reporter come on and explain the story because there seems to be some inconsistencies ... and I want to talk to her about it and the\nEditor said to me I'm not going to make my reporter available to you\nAbout the the the ... and arrogance of this woman was a we ask questions we don't answer questions\nAnd and then that is this is the level of arrogance and the my poop don't stink attitude\nFrom the the majority of the basket of biased press today and they've not earned it\nBecause ... mayor out and out biased if they were if they were ... a fair Mike and they were delivering a a a fair product the treated everybody ... you know at least they'd have something to hang our hat on but they're complete an auditor idling unfair not ... I Believe they deserve to be questioned\nAnd it it's our civic duty at citizens not only trick question\nIt's our civic duty at citizens not only trick question on government but it's a question are fresh\nAmen to that I mean I I don't believe they're immune from from criticism and I don't believe they are immune from being held accountable\nI agree ... thank you so much for your service you do a great job\nOn my thank you I appreciate a great point saw Katie Europe next walking because they'll say they'll show what's going on\nI'm Wondering and called out on my right now so I\nWill answer your own question why hasn't Sheila Jackson Lee and why hasn't the Congressional Black caucus condemned the Louis Farrakhan for his latest comment about Jews being termites why why do you think that is\nOut there but they don't care and I want to blame Trump when I'm On a on the wires relationship Jeremiah Wright and went on\nI Know for for ... don't forget Obama's animosity toward the the Jewish state of Israel how was he was completely undermining our allies Israel don't forget it was Donald Trump who put who moved our embassy to Jerusalem and and\nAnd that's how I Can't touch\nBenjamin Netanyahu Benjamin Netanyahu yes you\nCan actually a shell fire sell on ...\nMurata Rocco bump you have a rock Obama was one of the most anti Semitic presidents we've ever had and uh and his hostility toward the Jewish community his hostility toward Israel was was open for everybody to see our relations with the nation of Israel we're in an all time low during his occupation in the oval office and everybody knew it\nEverybody knew it private but\nHe caught on it and show a Muslim time I mean so frightening\nRight and and how many how many of the folks in the press reported on ... comments to begin with how many of them at ABC NBC CBS and CNN buried\nThat video of Louis Farrakhan as a matter of fact unless you watch Fox you didn't even know about it because the basket of bias press protects the Jew haters\nABC NBC CBS CNN because of Louis Farah ... relationship with the Democrats because of his relationship with the Congressional Black\nCommunists because of his relationship with Iraq Obama they'll ask their picture together smiling and oh yeah just young it up because of his relationship with Keith Ellison the number two Democrat in the DNC\nOr who Alison refuses to this day to condemn Louis Farrakhan that's the reason why the press will not report on this growing troubling strain of anti Semitism inside of the Democratic party they're trying to protect\nDemocrat Party from their anti Semitism instead of like Alan Dershowitz who was a Democrat ladies and gentleman and a Jew who said I Am very troubled by all this and he should be to a one sided by making seven three two one five I can see Jerry I appreciate your patience welcome to ...\nI think we should stop on it for us what it is\nTheir socialist communist that's all they are you watch on TV about uprising of Lenin the style and that's the number one thing they did was to train the news that the people are of the Soviet Union heard what difference do we have the right now none\nTheir socialist communist that's what they are really strict on them that\nWell how do I differentiate between them and the Democratic party because if I call I call them if I call them socialist communist well that's that's just like almost every other Democrat out there\nThat's what they are [laughter] well I'm sure I'm I'm I'm ruining their American communist I I'm a\nI'm a communicator I've got to tell you about which group we're talking about and of course not mountain maybe we can modify basket of biased to\nTo reflect their socialist communist bent which of course was the candidate they supporting the candidates they protect but ah Jerry let me just did was it a surprise to you to see the completely biased headline from the Washington Post that seem to catch Chris Wallace off guard this weekend on Fox News\nSunday I watch this this weekend I'm just more and more and more just Chris Wallace I Want him to be\nA reporter but he's not sure he's a liberal so he's a communist\nWell we know his dad and we know he are registered Democrats and they're now just because you're a registered Democrat doesn't mean at least in the past and didn't mean that you couldn't be fair in check your biases at the door I think among the basket of biased press\nChris Wallace is probably one that at least\nTry to get a half hearted effort at objectivity else he wouldn't have pointed out that the disgraceful\nAnd biased headline of the Washington Post but remember it's almost like a fraternity miss these members of the press they're all protecting each other and they won't criticize one another even even when they step out of line it's up it's it's insanity really at least Chris Wallace had the\nThe wherewithal to spend what did you spend two or three minutes this weekend saying I was shocked I was shocked by the Washington Post headline you folks thank you for the call buddy I appreciate it here's what Chris wild\nSet off by it I fully expect into this I suspect arrested in a sentence and bombs up some second outspoken supporter from such the headline on the Washington Post I went back and looked at the post\nFrom last year after Bernie Sanders supporter attack of Republican baseball practice and severely wounded ... know headline there about outspoken supporter of standards so the question is isn't fair to draw that kind of Lincoln front page yeah\nIs it fair and of course many of us would say no no it's not fair and this is what they do in the basket of bias pressed now Chris Wallace was the only one did Chuck Todd pointed out [noise]\nWho used to work in the Clinton more room over it ABC [noise]\nNow falafel just pointed out [noise]\nDid did did anybody else in the press say look\nWe've got a police ourselves\nWhen one of our colleagues steps out of line and harnessed she's the rest of us who must stand up or they don't they protect shove it so that the next person can write it clearly biased headline and get away with it [noise]\nBy the way many

who do still brave looking at that paper\nCan tell me whether or not they're headline was fair\nOr justice blatantly biased\nAs the Washington Post and again it's a comparative analysis ladies and

our our experience has is somebody we found a program before and uh he was our our go to guy went up when I heard about the atrocity in Pennsylvania the synagogue [noise]\nAh we wanted to get his comments because this is in my mind this has been a longtime building a we have seen during the occupation of the oval office of Obama\nArrives in anti Semitism in the United states has been sanctioned and excused by the Democrat Party the Democrat Party Congressional Black communists refusal to condemn Louis Farrakhan an anti Semitic comments they just they just flat out refuse\nAnd Keith Ellison the number two Democrat\nHuge and Keith Ellison the number two Democrat\nIn the um the Democrat Party at the DNC he ... around with Louis Farrakhan he's the first Muslim elected to Congress any hate Jews he's he is a racist and an anti Semite\nAnd this is tolerated by the Democrat Party and I and in in a in a disturbs me greatly and I knew that a A R e Spiro would have a commentary on that as far as collecting data\nOn all of those on the left who celebrated the shooting of Republicans\nI don't know that the FBI at that time\nBecause remember this was\nDuring the period where the FBI were they were cleaning house or the FBI from all\nThe Obama holdovers so some of the Obama holdovers may have wanted to\nMake sure that these individuals who were cheerleading\nThe killing of Republicans or didn't get the proper scrutiny or perhaps in the next shooters\nOr would they would come up to target improperly and you know on American fashion their political opposition to firearms\nOr I just I I Can't I Can't tell you whether it was done or not I don't know I didn't hear of reportage then I got to be honest with you I didn't hear a reporter at all um one would like to think that there was some person of responsibility\nInside the government the time they would have taken note of individuals who were logging and praising the gunning down of\nRepublicans but I just I Can't tell you that I Know thanks for the call buddy and they give it the kind words I'm\nAri Shapiro is a is a favorite of ours mark appreciate your patience welcome to

don't need guys that you got your church just absolutely ridiculous\nThat wasn't Bloomberg was a that was that was the communist up to ...\nTo bond you I'm sure a Cuban yeah they did it on the ashes the idea of what the Democrats and for ... you know this has been a clear clear view I Would say of the Democratic party and what their structure is what their intent is marked down from\nYou know you look at the the the ones that are declared their socialism or it's Bernie Sanders two years ago\nThey're not hiding it any more than ... years ago they were hiding you really do the last couple of years\nThere have you looked at that you know you're like you're giving up on both parties quite honestly or to\nKeep our democracy when Britain and Marshall favor their conservative in in the moderates in the Republican because I haven't heard the our noticed any inherent\nSupporting the socialist\nParty of any or whether it's a socialist Democrats the students are social stem democracy and all that it you know you look up the definition basically socially want overthrow our freedom and democracy can throw it out ... and the distribution of up and baseball\nThere's the other is the economic side there there's the economic side\nAnd there's political socialism which is which is fun too but look I mean\nYour what you had to go in and wanting\nWhat you said about ... market let let me put it back to what you said about Republicans 'cause I Want to focus in on that for just for a minute here because I and and what what it costs me as a conservative to leave the Republican Party\nWas not the fact that they were advocating the positions the ever growing anti American positions the Democrat Party whether it be socialism whether it be communism whether it be what they're doing in the government\nRun schools it wasn't that he was re indifference to the Republican Party led with seeing these seeing these activities happened from the other side and just saying oh well we just have a disagreement ...\nNo ... and you know what the only person to restore my faith ironically enough on the Republican Party was a newcomer to the Republican Party but the name of Donald Trump a man who said look I'm not going to apologize for being an American I'm not going to apologize for being pro American in America first\nThe way the Republican Party had done up until that point they were apologizing they were acquiesced thing they were they were count telling the Democrats and I and my belief mark Donald Trump showed the Republican Party had a fight once again\nAbsolutely and he gave the emphasis to that democracy and freedom and free enterprise show\nYou don't get up and down and it was given to them or not you still you know you look at from in all honesty from your first one performance they take out any of the rhetoric and news at any personal but he he done in the past but you know ... he's the example by\nA example of a first in the United states can take up a business\nWrote to the point that again in Britain the United states what a week for a fashion or democratic society that every opportunity under freedom of the constitution that date irritability and go to be friends\nAnd then you know and if each it'll cherishing value that system that the epitome of like an individual country to state and in state that poor front take that responsibility it's amazing to me that they can to years\nAnd I didn't think that we were that perceptive to change that quick but look what he's done officials altering which I guess that's it because you don't hear too many people were getting it based on the economy unemployment employing people people welfare\nAll the things he's done in two years after him another eight years\n[laughter] here's your day out more
