Mr Trump told actually oh guess what\nYou don't you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it with an executive order the president continue\nNow I Know what's going on here there's there's some political gamesmanship going on here what the president is doing is he's going to force the left wing\nTo do with the left wing doesn't want to be done\nOf the United states to reject the border will end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nPresident or the United states ... executive order will end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nThat will of course trigger judicial review and the president knows it and his advisors notice\nYou guys know that birthright citizenship for any Tom Dick or Harry breaks it of the country or overstayed their visa has never been challenged by the Supreme Court there's never been a ruling guess what this executive order will do\nUnlike Brock Obama Donald Trump\nHas the courage to put his\nPen to paper and make it an official executive order remember the executive inaction memo the rock Obama issued basically creating law he never put it in the form of\n... a an executive order that's it couldn't have been challenged by the judiciary and couldn't have been reviewed by the judiciary if it had been Brock Obama's command to the federal government not to obey the law when it comes to illegal immigrants and deporting illegal aliens\nUm it it would have been challenged immediately so he just whisper it in Jay Johnson and all the secretaries years to implement what he was saying it was a mental and that's not subject\nTo judicial review it it didn't really have the force of law now he had an administration that was full of a bunch of law and city it's\nA bunch of unconstitutional anti constitutional neurons who did everything this guy said and would violate the law and violate your rights for him their loyalty wants to residents Obama not to the United states of America\nAnd they do to fully complied instead of saying no I you know what the law expressly prohibits me from from doing what you're asking me to do Mr Obama\nAnd uh they went along so here comes out job\nI think that birthright citizenship is wrong and he's saying he's going to stop it felt trust me the president knows he doesn't have the power to do this he doesn't have the power to do is I I guarantee you the president of the United states does not have the power\nLooking back everybody for self it'll show high on your liberty loving Latino herself said oh glad\nYou made in the program do not mistake me for those loud mouth leftist Latinos out there actually love my country and I love my state and the United states of America and the great state of Texas is why I Am one hundred percent in favor\nOf eliminating this idea of birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens\nThose who break into our country who\nViolate our sovereignty should not have\nThey or their progeny be rewarded for doing such a thing uh\nI Believe in an orderly legal process is the reason why people come here is for that legal an orderly process and the stability it provides those of you who say that illegal immigration as the way to go\nOr you're just at wrong you're just dead wrong\nAnd you're threatening to turn this country end of the very countries that many of these illegal aliens or flame now do\nYou agree with the suspension of birthright citizenship\nThat so many questions to weigh one five eight seven three two one five at a KFC don't forget bottom of the hour folks will talk about their horrific shooting in Pennsylvania with Bridgette Gabriel she has made a career of fighting these anti Semitic refunds whether they'd be\nIndividuals like this range Jew hater that did they pulled the trigger or their ideological cousins in radicalized Islamic fundamentalists terrorists\nWill I'm getting all that coming out in the meantime Willie glad you made it work in the course they'll say they'll show what say you about birthright citizenship sir\nYou are in the ... you know saying oh I\nWonder what does it make any what doesn't make any sense\nYou're going to get rid of this I'm trying to find it you know what maybe\nYou've argued that goes to me I'm going to shoot\nI give them a\nBecause I remember that the idea of\nOf leaving our borders wide open and susceptible to attack is is relatively new I mean our founding fathers and those who had put in the fourteenth amendment could never have conceived a country as stupid\nAs our country has been really in the last fifty years to allow rampant unchecked unfettered illegal immigration and they ...\nIt's been years to allow rampant unchecked unfettered illegal immigration and they never would have considered that that we would elect people so stupid and so at the Arctic as the Republicans and Democrats who have allowed twenty twenty five million illegal aliens to stream into the country\nAre saying well if you if I were to no\nNo no I understand you're all persons born or naturalized in the United states and set up to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside no state she'll make or enforce any law which shell abridged the privilege\nOr or immunities um since since the United states north of the state deprive any person of life liberty or property okay\nWhat what a construction as judge will do\nIs take the fourteenth amendment and as a as a badge of other amendments ... the fourteenth amendment wasn't just\nA past to address this but I think it was a it was three or four amendments of memory serves there were passed to normalize the citizenship of freed slaves so any construction the judge will take the actual history into account not not not not\nSaying that oh well we're going to apply what they were doing you know back in Seventy and eighty nine I'm\nAt to amend the constitution to today's standards were not going to do that we're gonna we're gonna go with the original intent of of this amendment and the original intent is clear it was to rectify\nA America's a black guy of slavery so ... and they would rule citing the contemporary their contemporaries in the judiciary and in the Congress of the time that passes or the pass this law or there's some edited\nIt yeah and and that's what you call them originalists that's why you call them construction is they actually don't ignore history the way the leftist do\nWe get a pretty high buddy thank you very much will it when you go to Alan what do you say well can the president said oh she'll birthright citizenship in or out\nChris Lee and never should have been put in in the last hundred years okay a number one it's a it's a simple change\nIf you were born in the United states with at least\nOne of your parents an American citizen you are an American citizen if not you are not\nI don't care if they're over here on a work visa or a blue car paint card or whatever you are a citizen and ... and ... at least one of your parents are a citizen [noise]\n... yeah I think that that's that's one interpretation I'm not exactly sure how this is all going to go down I don't necessarily object to that Alan but if somebody's over here legally and has a child their intent wasn't to have a child or to be an anchor baby and\nThat they that the parents can't and there and they need to be some sort of ... education on this to the parents can't use the child until they're uh adults as\nAs as an anchor if you will to to get into the United states they they must they must follow the example that Brian bill Braves mom did taking her son back to Australia and going and living there until he's of legal age to come back\nI mean look at what the Chinese were doing hotels over in California that they were flying all these women over two babies\nHospital babies and then flying back and now we've got all these American citizen babies that are now back in China that are waiting to come back over here and get educated and everything or here in the United states that where you will be paying for because now there are American citizens\nYeah no and knowing the communist Chinese they're probably being trained in indoctrinated over there to to work on the destruction of the United states wants to get back\nBut I mean my my ideal is you have to have one American parent if they're over here and they're not an American citizen they\nHaven't gone to the trouble of being an American citizen so why shouldn't be an American citizen\nNow this is I'm a ... this is something we have to do I believe in our defense Allen because there are bad actors out there who are now taking advantage of\nOf our elected leaders silliness their irresponsibility on illegal immigration and uh I I think we have to stop it and I you know kudos and Donald Trump for being well the first president in my lifetime you know to address this directly and you do you agree with how this process is all going to work out\nOh yeah oh yeah I mean you know a lot smarter than what people give him credit for is not um Donnell is that one caller keeps on coming in you know he knows what he's doing he says stuff for a reason and what do you think that was a dumb comment or not\nIt does it for a reason and he's doing this to court and the legality this law\nThank you for him to do things you had to call thank you very much odd to I Want five eight seven three eight to eight one five I can see Tom let's say you about all this\nVery ... um that we have a principle of law that if you do something if you commit a crime than anything you do some scripts and can committing the crime is null and void\n[noise] I'm not I'm not a lawyer a I'm not even I don't even play one on TV but I live in you know I understand that yeah I Know right I understand that the concept that you're articulating but I\nI just um [noise] I don't I don't know what the legal term for that is but I but I Do recall something of that nature that it's that the the the fruit of the poisoned tree tied up a rationale and I don't disagree I think that that that applies here\nAnd then you know with with respect to the folks that do come here legitimately um you know they they can't come here without the government's permission so you basically say you're you know within two or three months that having a baby avenue here\nSo you ... do you realize that since birthright citizenship me came\nIn vogue that has never been a Jew dictated by the Supreme Court the Supreme Court how to never ruled no it has never ruled on this so that is that is what I Believe Donald Trump is forcing he's forcing the Supreme Court to finally make a ruling on the fourteenth amendment and its application in it I mean all\nThey could I don't think it's going to work at the way you think oh I I use ... that's a very simply written amendment and I don't I don't know that you're going to get ... I don't think it's reports been ruled where they're going to rule\nOr well now why do you say that now that it's a majority constitutional court\nOr I mean you just read the simple language of the of the amendment or um it's pretty clear if you were born here and you're a citizen something\nRight I've heard of him on the conservative ... no I understand I understand the amendment\nAnd just doesn't seem to me that you're going to get past that amendment so you got a lot from other principal\nWell again up and they they're they're going to go back and look at the history of the amendment why it was passed a they're not going to say well we understand the founding fathers intent was to free was to give citizenship to the children are freed slaves but we're going to ignore all that because the taxes this\nI don't know how to an account they don't want to talk about it and this is exactly why and my new book rise I my book came out a few weeks ago it's titled the rise and I thought well cries\nBecause people need to understand what's at stake in our country I have a chapter in the book titled the left is Islamist coalition\nI have another chapter in the book that talks about the stream media\nAnd what they're doing and and and how they have turned against our nation and how they were stories\nOr sweet stories under the carpet if it does not serve a quote their party or their talking points because we have seen as one of the box right now\nThey all talk together so that the Clinton would say something about me I Would say something that happened to those would say something the Washington Post let's say something they walked lock stock and barrel and they used the exact same same talking points where the exact same more than the exact same verbiage\nSo when it doesn't serve their interests when it doesn't serve their agenda and there and gold because let's face it they are focused on an end goal and that is ...\nRetaining power or thinking back to our in our country and they don't care what lies they have to say what stories they have to three asleep under the carpet what they have to cover as long as what ever they say will get moving forward\nAs an army towards the end goal and this is why we're not hearing condemnation from the mainstream media we're not hearing that has come out even from leaders on the Democratic party and that needs to be exposed and the good people uh crafts people who love America\nDon't believe in equality under the law believe that we are all equal in the eyes of God\nWho believe that we need to come together and save our principles and the foundation that made this country great we need to come together and Ron is in defense of our Judeo Christian values and freedom\nBecause his own values and freedom is what made America shining city on a hill a beacon of light to the world and that's exactly what we need to get back to we need to understand how\nOur enemy is organizing how the left has turned against America\nHow they are building coalitions with Islam is like Sarah can who used to like and then that that rhetoric that is leading the violence that we are witnessing right now in our country whether violence against Jews whether violence against good between Arctic Americans\nWho just show up around the way the American flags and say we put America First and we serve I Want and they should have first and we want American people to be I I\nServed first it's those type of people who are backed by the left but we need to understand what we can do as a miracle loving patriots and how we can take

share it with your friends\nTo donate it the public libraries in your community that's how we're going to be able to take our country we can no longer to sit on the sidelines and watch what's happening to our country and shake our heads and say\nI Can't believe we got here how do we get here well now we know are we are and we know what we need to do to look forward to protect our nation and thing back our nation\nYou know I there's been a few loan voices and the one that springs to my mind the eight years of Obama\nDid many things do harm this country but one of the things it seemed to do with the Obama administration seems a mainstream anti Israel anti Jewish and the strain inside of the Democratic party and you know and granted to put it yeah Alan Dershowitz who was a law a lifelong Democrat who was a Jew and so\nHe was alarmed by what he saw and one of the few voices in and many in the basket of biased press banned him from their air because they didn't want him to sell these alarm bells about this this\nCancer a strain on the Democratic party that now is alive and well of anti Semitism you saw the same thing as\nA ... exactly of course we feel the same thing look when Obama was running that that the left one out of their weight behind him with Sarah can because everybody knew what an anti Semite fair I can ... the Obama we knew his relationships and he's friendships\nWould that would leave for example with people even at the new within he's called days\nIn the semi who were anti Israel Palestinians the dirtiest Palestinians who hated Israel and the Jews and wanted the destruction of the Jews when Obama was a candidate for president and people like me is to sell the alarms\nBut she's associations with anti semis and where he is he's a rhetoric and all these friendships with and these guys and and the Jews and and the Israelis nobody want it to some people accused of\nBeing and tolerance and and you know haters of Obama because he was black which I think\nYou know person on his character and on his words and Obama that's exactly where he's done a you know he's actually spoke louder than words his friendships you associate shows and look what we are today and I think the example of destruction\nOn all of our relationship with Israel of that reputation and out of the Jewish people in the unit\nOf our relationship with Israel the reputation of the Jewish people in the United states how there and people are against them wanting to have a friendship with Iran is\nI Know I I was just going there and look at the Iran nuclear deal

refined products\nDon't even though the refinery there and you know the crude oil that's coming from South America and Mexico to the U.S will just noted that refinery and and and you know problems\nAnd that's my point there more than just that refinery is that international relationships are not so simple diplomacy\nIt seems to have a bad word diplomatic and solve things in a in an intelligent way like the the the the terrorists that are going on you know if it were up to me\nI Would send a letter and tell them we're not interested in doing any business would you trade with you anymore but the approach that had met a stranger is taking I think they're learning America posted a terrorist is actually hurting us\nWell I I'm a liberal or you give me a lot to chew on so first of all you're right about the refinery and the and the bigger issue there about the refining issues don't forget that oil is is a the worldwide traded commodity it's not just in the United states\nIt'll is is they the worldwide traded commodity it's not just in the United states so if if prices in Mexico go up there will be there will be a cascading effect of of oil prices across the board but on on your contention that ah that\nTrump's trade policies with China are hurting are hurting the United states there is some pain I'm not going to lie to you in the United states but China is gaining is getting far worse China's economy according to\nUm this is an article written in the u._k. express but to other people that publishes as well\nChina's economy is feeling the full brunt of the escalating trade war with the United states much more severely Asian stock market has been rattled on consumer fears of a slow down an economic growth and China's economic growth is slowing slowing dramatically\nSo that the idea that we are being hurt that is true but China is being hurt much more and it's not just is not just their ability to sell their goods\nTo build up their their military infrastructure which is what's happening\nAnd it's also a than the Chinese sapped of intellectual property that is on the table\nSo I think that if the president and utilizing every tool they can and frankly the Chinese don't respond to anything else but slap you upside the head brute force otherwise they will they will eat everybody else for lunch as they have done for years in the United states that's how we got very\nVery important point and to prove my point honest intellectual property let's say China comply the hundred per cent\nOn protecting American intellectual property in technology

the president did was condemned by these heinous act or very first thing that the media did was condemned the president [noise]\nOut Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday she's absolutely correct [noise]\nThe the attempt by the basket of biased press which includes now the star telegram and Fort Worth a Democrat morning news in Dallas and Houston comical their first attempt or to to try to blame President Trump for all the ills\nThat are happening in the country while they held Morocco Obama all the mass shootings that happened during his occupation in the oval office they held him blameless\nNaturally call folks pure ... biased one hundred percent biased and Brock Obama was just his position\nAs Donald Trump is accused of being\nBiased media continued to defend Democrats incivility toward the president while insisting that President should not fight back let's listen to this you guys are going to be floored\nThat the press says Well Donald Trump needs to not fight back it for the good of the country let Democrats be as vicious and is angry and spiteful as they want to be but in the interest of the country for the good of the country the president should not fight back\nAnd now\nWe just rallies as the Andy\nModern rallies porters are off the top of the reasons\nThe president's going to continue to draw a contrast let's not forget that needs to change I'm afraid to repeat it repeatedly attacked the president whether it was Eric Holder St chicken when they're down whether it's Hillary Clinton and saying you can't be civil and he'll Democrats have control of Congress for when there is Maxine Waters who who've encouraged her\nSupporters to get out not just in the president's face to all administration officials faces\nCourage for supporters to get up not just in the president's face of all it ministry officials faces I Know the actions are from those Democrats the president's going to continue to fight back when these individual not only attack him but attacks members of his administration and supporters of his administration\n[noise] then here comes Haley Jackson who says you know the president should not punch back against his critics for the good of the country\nOf course of history saying the descendants prices\nBalances the midterms are coming up so much now like the White House now because\nOf the terms I visited I've defended the president I've defended the president's fighting back when he was regularly attacked there's a different matter if there's a mid term or not the president is going to defend themselves in a fight back\nIsn't this woman great I Sarah Huckabee Sanders is probably the greatest press secretary for Republican of all time I really I I I truly believe that\nBecause she noticed how she didn't accept Haley Jackson's flawed premise but the only reason why the president's doing this is because of the midterms insanity they've been they've been moaning and complaining about this since he didn't he went down the escalator back in twenty Fifteen\nFrom one to go for it right you making that from any perspective but at one point there's a national tragedy precedence over the president\nDid you guys hear that a national tragedy so the president by Haley\nJackson's in ... the president is supposed to sit back and allow Democrats and and her network at MSNBC to say the president is responsible for all of this heinous violence that we've seen and he's not supposed to respond for the good of the country\nIs a national tragedy take precedence over the fact is now when I think\nHe saw the president by doing exactly that in the wake of a national tragedy not just simply that every time our country has experienced that type of heartache in pain that we have over the last week just as a president who's rhythm to that occasion a and\nWork to bring our country together in a number of occasions whether it's a hurricane whether it's for walks Vegas shooting whether it was the first shooting all horrible horrible tragedy is that the country's experience in this president's come out can damage the attacks wanted high is caused by an individual\nAnd tried to look for ways to provide and bring the country together when it was a natural disaster\nCan you hold on to the knowledge that in the next breath after he calls for unity he got to talk about just visually and strong contrast\nYeah he noticed how she when when residents Obama gets up there\nAnd he talks about division and he tries to divide the country that's that's okay that's permissible when he was occupying the oval office and when he's out there on the campaign trail now violating every tradition of former president\nThat's okay but Haley Jackson insists that when the president draws distinctions\nBetween his approach and his opponents approach well that's just to visit this and that can be Republicans are not allowed to to define themselves Republicans are supposed to allow Haley Jackson in the biased pressed\nTo find them or the Democrats to to find them\nIf he didn't want to do some toning down and tell me down once\nAgain I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did with convincingly attacking the very first thing in the bed was blame the president at\nA you have a huge responsibility to play in the divide for nature of this country when Ninety percent of the coverage of everything is president guys is negative despite the fact that the country is doing extremely well yeah\nAs a matter of fact the reason why it's Ninety percent negative is because many of the people that were in charge of the basket of bias press do not agree with a prosperous America\nA safe America and America stands up for its principles abroad that gets in the face of bad actors like Venezuela the Chinese the Russians Oh yes did you guys hear liquefied natural gas contract with Germany undermining Vladimir ...\nThat's what that's a great that's a great thing not only to Texas benefit but we also undermine a man who hates our country every bit as much as the Democrats do let them you're ...\nSo\nYou you understand what the what the basket of biased presses trying to do dopey Trump don't be Trump Trump don't stand up for yourself let us to find you let the Democrats upon you to wait George W. Bush did\nTake take the high road sacrifice what's best for America so Democrats can win you know take the bill Kristol approach just talk about conservatism don't actually do anything about it\nUp\nThat's what they're sanctioning so Democrats can feel better about themselves so Democrats can start choking up some victory so basically what Haley Jackson and the basket of bias prejudice and disarm unilaterally disarm let us choose the right Democrats to run this country\nAnd you and Republicans and conservatives have no say just surrender that's what they're saying for the good of the country\n[laughter] [noise] I'm Sorry folks not only no but heck no break him on Fox News staying up\nAll about Donald Trump but he seems to be obsessed with himself but so do his political
