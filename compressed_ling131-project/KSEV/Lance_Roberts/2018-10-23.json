those two teams you you you got any examples you want to throw throw my wife oh the audience you know really resolved ...\nThe reason I wrote the navy and Notre Dame game or the Saturday to because I'm interested in seeing some pay five school if they're actually going to uh\nPut me through the ringer about the shot blocks\nAnd\nThat there was a one shot blocked call made this past Saturday gets University of Houston uh and it it's part of their it's it's part of their strategy that there's you know I saw a video evidence of it being done repeatedly\nAnd guess who they were targeting oh probably Oliver\nOver yeah number one and\nIt it is just it it defies\nAny sense to think that if at all over without a pay five school a name school\nThat would be tolerated\nAnd you know I hate to hate to\nDo that they had I haven't seen in major Applewhite address this at all\nWell that that's another discussion is that as a as a concern says temperament and how he presents himself and uh you know a really you know he he kind of\nKeep any kind of a\nYeah he's got a hot hand he likes he keeps his emotions in check I get what you're saying there and he knows hopefully he at least I spoke with the American athletic conference ... and a\nConference powers that be and at least express his his displeasure over there so I Know he's not one to ... to drag this out on the field but I didn't know whether if he said anything in a press conference\nOr in addressing that's whatsoever I I Know some sometimes coaches have to keep me tongue in cheek about criticizing officials as well uh in

a thing of\nAll it was a\nWell you know what it's it's funny fields but it's also scary because of how much of a true\nAdvertising yeah well thanks for the call them and I appreciate what a perfect set up by it was like he's almost up he's almost\nPart of the production crew here because they'll say it'll show a alley stuffy who used to work at a blaze are with me or is it see our TV Now and she made a parity spot ladies and gentlemen for what it means to vote Democrat now some of this doesn't translate to radio so I'm going to have to I'm going to have to\nStop it and tell you what's going on in the background because they have video components backing up\nWho they're talking about the here's alley study formerly the blaze now let's see our TV she is doing a service for all of America by telling the truth about Democrats in an ad she created for Democrats [noise]\nHi\nI'm a single person for the Democratic party and I'm here to tell you why you need to know blue December Democrat they're the party of loving tolerance for inclusion and the ... genes and good\nWell now while she's talking over our shoulder you see while died leftists calling at the Supreme Court you see a an individual roundhouse kick a man kicking a woman who is pro life you\nYou see the hordes of left wing or is attacking a prayer march out in Portland and in Seattle and that's that's the loving Democrat Party\nRepublicans don't care about any of these things and they just want to talk about record unemployment the economy keeping community things ... fashion\nDemocrats have positive practical priorities like abolishing the electoral college women eating due process hacking and banning he needs the values and the American\nWell that leads to Americans that live in San Francisco New York do Republicans often use fear mongering rank like in the constitution or liberty Democrats condemned such language intimate than than instead focus on more unifying topics like repealing the second amendment or nearing for the national anthem\nAfter the party of equality so much so that we insist upon unconditionally bleeding limited just believing then because while and then and then\nIf you ask them to explain this logically me will scream in your faith in calling you document\nAnd Republicans want to take away a woman secret right to choose to have her child the complicated inside the room and torn apart room by room with more than Democrats celebrate the right to violently murdered your child because\nAnd didn't have that women are\nPowerful and independent they're also helpless making the patriarchy who required government intervention to cede\nAny woman who disagrees with us on this is a self hating Jew Mountain\n[laughter] oh man folks how you guys can see how much of this is true\nAh where where\nIndividuals come out and accused a Democrat or sexual orientation and they're not to be believed Keith Ellison still running\nFor the attorney general's office in Minnesota his opponent took him to school over all the accusations that this anti American pro Louis Farrakhan individual is all about and also being under investigation for abusing his girlfriend\nAnd you know it's time someone was finally brazen as you said that Republicans are rates and\nHad the same positive message for minority that we have for when you're a victim and you're supposed to ask\nIf you disagree evil until your intelligence\nAnd that and that's that's Kanye West showing up in the background if you disagree with Democrats were going to destroy your reputation and we're going to call you a dumb negro the way CNN\nDid for your own garden Republicans wanting to stop people from coming into this country and they said the infiltration of gang violence or opioid there's sex trafficking injuries in illegal immigration\nThe Democrats the just the natural consequences of opening up the borders which of course it the more loving thing down Democrats recognize the key to a better tomorrow is to look forward not back where it might even jak capitalism and all of the greed and set up for socialism like\n'cause we're still while every kind of try to parties and harming the poor and marginalized weakened and yeah\nWe are the folks who now behind her when she's saying the week in the marginalized she's showing ... from Facebook\nShe's showing millionaire Barbra Streisand only Hollywood elites beyond saying Jay Z all of these multi millionaires dire brothers they're all coming up yes that's the that's the party of the marginalized and the and the everyday common man the Democrat Party it's it's a laugh riot the full version of this folks\nIs on the course they'll say they'll show Facebook page and you will laugh your butt off but\nAlso you'll go wow\nThat standard coming up next folks\nI'll let you know about an email I got yesterday\nWhile I mean it's extremely strong the actual pace is stronger than ever done we're doing post a seven dollars an hour in Harris County\nOr you know we would have ... if we open as many hours as we were in the presidential uh two years ago we were they ceded those numbers as we were and open and destroy an hour and a half in the presidential just because\nThere was a presidential who would've thought that you know this amateur cycle would be going it at the same taste yeah now who is that benefit in your mind a\nLive said both parties journey I mean I've actually looked at the you know people with primary voting history of both parties and it's a very tight fact the Democrat Party that turned out a few more than the Republican Party\nBased upon last primary voting history or is it there's a lot of independent so that you don't have never voted in one primary or the other ... and ah you know\nYou know a quick analysis says it's very fun\nSo I was a very very important that people for just a pay no they can't on the big rally they get all it's all taking care of you know that ah there's election is over no\nNo no I I concur and I'm Stan Stan standard everybody our our guest right now Harris County clerk or to bring the conversation full circle a if you are going out you're going to early vote or even on election day\nAh people need to know their rights so would you articulate the restrictions on political speech on intimidation on shouting on all that kind of thing what do people have to know so we they can no one understand when the other side of violating the rules\nOr any you know anything beyond a one hundred foot marker a freedom of speech a now they want to use ... case and they have to be a thousand feet out\nBut then once you within a hundred foot marker the they're not supposed to be a NPT near path that tried to talk to you being in your way in any of\nYou know way no and then that once you get into the polling place there should not be anybody in their politicking um you are supposed to turn off your cell phone\nOr when you come to the polling place\nAnd uh it should be totally the privacy of the voting booth and there's lots of eyes of both parties in early voting so it's it's a fairly safe environment uh there's\nThere's just a lot more people working or be about\nYou and I you and I reside in the state where the the current Democratic Party is under investigation for massive voter fraud or checking the box for citizenship and then sending out that registration for him to non citizens in that environment\nAnd if you roll up on a polling place and I again not in Harris County and may not be an issue but in other counties that are within the sound of our boys it may be an issue where the Democrats are the only ones who have hired people there and they may be allowing some of this nonsense because again the Democrat Party has already shown they're willing to cheat to win this election\nUh what would you suggest if this kind of thing as being allowed inside of the polling place\nUm you know once once you really want to vote [laughter]\nStay right and I would I Would do it non confrontational make them think you're on the other side and just go vote like you want to vote but at the same time I would ... you know after I voted I'm going to be talked Cronkite through the lecture fish or whoever's in charge of writing about election left in Israel you know\nRespond to you and a satisfactory method how your party or your party chair or they should be able to have some impact influence all your elected officials are yours and they have all your state's ...\nDon't let them just sit around and be able to do this to

the Late Show yesterday give me a rank saying I'm I'm going to be escorting my wife\nTo the I'm a concealed carry permit holder I'm going to be a ... my wife\nUh to uh to the polls and I said you know what that's probably good I'm going to be a sorting my wife as well or in case in case ladies are being threatened or intimidated by by the Texas left wing and uh I think that's I I think there is safety in numbers when you go to the polls yes\nYes safety in numbers but you it is illegal to bring your firearm into the polls\nAnd as you do have a concealed carry around you need to leave it in your vehicle\nNeed to leave it in your vehicle that's that's a that's a very well put so now the number of the folks need to call you up if they see any of the shenanigans going on voter intimidation or give that phone number one more time\nAnd that's the end Harris votes dot com it's seven one three seven five five six nine six five\nOne more time seven one three seven five five six nine to five as the election ... an answer any questions or if you have any of these issues they can get rolled up and get it addressed\nStand I appreciate your carving out of time and the sage words and the very

know you know you're right you're not allowed\nTo approach me maybe as Dan recommended going there and vote and then do it afterward\nYou in ... to me on the way into the polling place\nI voted but I'm going to report you\nSo maybe you can spare and again ladies I wouldn't recommend you doing this by yourselves\nGiven the nature of our political opposition than what they'd been up to these last two years the violence that we've seen courtesy of the Democratic party [noise]\nI Would go in numbers\nAnd I would make sure that you've got each other's backs [noise]\nThis is a consequential election and the other side knows it\nBack in a minute because they don't show on the boards [noise]\nHome dream for conservative talk radio can actually use several hundred am boy from Texas\nOr if

morning Chris I'm doing fine thank you I got a quick kits and then I Want to share something with you I saw yesterday sure enough to\nThings you can avoid that raise your cost of borrowing mortgage insurance and jumbo loans\nYou know many people still believe you have to put twenty percent down to avoid private mortgage insurance known as pay and I that's not true with good credit you can do it with as little as five percent now it's like you're alone into two and as long as your primary loan doesn't exceed eighty percent of the value there is no P. M. I.\nYou might pay slightly more ... interest is tax deductible TMI is not an at least the dollars you're standing or going towards paying off year alone not waste it on something that that that is that you\nRemember too on jumbo loans\nWhich is any amount over four fifty three one hundred rates are higher than they are on a conventional loan so if you want to say a six hundred thousand dollar home you're putting twenty percent down financing for eighty than we would split that between a first for four fifty three one and a second lane for the balance\nAnd you can avoid the higher rates on a jumbo works real well\nOkay I think I followed most of that [laughter] jumbo and all those kinds of okay and so what was your the thing you saw yesterday\nI saw yesterday I live in the sugar land area and I ran out to grab a bite for lunch and noticed that the building where my office is there's a plane flying by and it's one of those it's pulling a fine\nAnd it was great because it had a sign that that looked like the ... side but it had one of those circles with a line drawn through it like no and the wording next to it said because socialism su X.
