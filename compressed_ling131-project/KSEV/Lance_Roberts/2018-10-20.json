understand your your feelings you know look up George Soros\nI understand your your feelings you know look up George Soros how did he make his money very instructive thank you for the call and you're up next year on the results they do show what's going on\nAnd I come I'm kind of our subject I'm Talking about the ... not sure I I don't understand is one commercial that if we don't that is going to be a huge payout we do though they won't be a tax increase what are your thoughts about property [noise]\nProp be as a consequence of a poorly run city in my estimation property\nAs a consequence of of disparate pay the the the talking point goes like this police officers are paid disproportionately\nAh more than firefighters who lay their lives on the line or for the community as well in the very dangerous job and need a job that they do lifesaving job that they do so\nThe the problem is there has been such\nSuch a problem with disparate pay inside of inside if used in their pension issues which still aren't resolved totally which will never be absolve bigger resolved because left wing governments don't make tough decisions they just keep on kicking the can down the road waiting for the successor to take care of it\nOr if you vote for a pay increase for any city employee\nOr any class of city employee it is going to raise taxes\nBecause you know in a left wing government they don't cut anything they never cut anything they always say it's because they've got to keep their graft in place they've got to keep their ability for their politicians to keep on skimming off the top from the tax payers that's not going to go away\nSo what happens is they end up passing that cost on to even more exorbitant taxes to pay for their incompetence and running city government\nNow the ... as a as a conservative government is run in Houston they would find other areas to cut inefficiencies that grass I mentioned that the political patronage that would go away to help bring the firefighters into a more competitive pay structure\nCompared to other cities around the state of Texas\nOr many say and I'm a believer of this and the the firefighters because of the inherent job the dangers in the job they do in the life saving job they do have earned a better pay structure\nHowever that will translate into into higher taxation because left wing or is run the government\nAnd they don't believe they don't believe in finding efficiencies and government they believe on a punishing the taxpayer to make that happen so they can keep all their goodies have their cake and eat it too so how do you\nThink you're going to vote [noise] uh I I Do not live in the city of Houston so I have no say in that matter\nThat if you did [noise] [noise] that's a good question um I I hadn't\nGiven it much thought how I Would approach it if I had a because I I it was it wasn't something I could get into [noise] I Am I Am not in favor of empowering a\nGovernments of anytime more ability to take money out of my pocket mhm uh that being said I Do believe I Do\nBelieve the firefighters if we want to keep good firefighters in the city of Houston\nYou can't you can't underpaid them the way they're being underpaid and the stats that I've seen it's a pretty accurate charge\nMhm uh they can't be they had to pay ... left the free market is going to take over they're going to move\nAnd they're gonna they're gonna take worse by the way you're seeing the same thing Amy in Dallas with the police officers the police officers in Dallas are so severely underpaid that city one of the largest cities in the country they can't keep staffing\nAt a proper level so they're losing cops everywhere right and what happens is ironically enough the firefighters up there are other first responders to domestic violence calls and are being chased around by guys with knives and of course that's a liberal city too\nSo they can't get their act together either and in the end it's only going to cost the taxpayers\nTo you're paying for inefficient government\nI Believe the firefighters deserve a pay raise but I also believe that people have Houston deserve a conservative government is going to ... that's going to be good stewards with their money and you don't have it\nUm ... this whole thing has been a fairy tale there's really not much there and ultimately he is going to learn that this is not a progressive state is going to learn the hard way\nYeah ... like our gas right now GOP consultant Washington time telling us a let me ask you about you mentioned the down ballot races and this is there seems to be the Democrats national strategy playing uh\nYou mentioned the down ballot races and this is and it seems to be the Democrats national strategy playing out in Texas it's not that they are taking advantage of our last election under under a straight ticket voting right and the idea is to create a cult like following behind that vacuous\nA vanilla type Democrat left wing extremists from every Democrat in the states to take out not the folks in the top but\nThe base of the Republican Party which is the down ballot folks that judges the state senators and state representative when you've got when you've got Bryan Obama and uh what's his name Eric Holder playing in a state representatives raised up in North Texas with Matt Rinaldi odd you know there's something up here\nYeah look I'm straight to voting in this election cycle [noise] um I don't think that that that the Republican Party leadership including the governor and legislators state party chair James Dickey would have\nSupported that are they not thought it was a good thing for the future of the state so this is the last election cycle will see that Democrats have always voted straight ticket statewide at a higher percentage than Republicans\nOne of the messages I think you're going to hear from go rabbits and the governor Patrick and others are the next whatever it is Seventeen Days is that Republicans need to go straight ticket\nOr we got to match their straight ticket strength as much as we can uh generally we've been in the low sixties they've been in the high sixties in terms of percentages of straight ticket voting\nUm if if they do voted a higher level of straight ticket for whatever reason Republicans voted a lower level that is going to affect down bell races look if you look across the state Chris you've got I don't know twenty or so really consequential races you have at least three competitive congressional races one of which is in Houston withdrawn cold as soon as you know and um\nBe sessions race in Dallas is very very competitive and then we'll urgency Antonio has been for the past I think he's going to win a you've got your two state Senate races that are pivotal as well as ... out in ... county and then ... and then the donor funds in Dallas\nAnd then as you rightly pointed out you've got to read all the race and and probably nine or maybe even twelve more or state house races that could go in either direction so the down about stuff matters um it's going to matter in terms of how the Republicans in the house how many ... we have we have the three ... majority we need to move legislation without democratic support\nOr you have a number of county wide races for for Ford county what offices in urban counties in suburban counties so there's a lot of action this election cycle and I even mentioned the judges were really important so\nUh you're right I mean the strict ticket factor is going to be one to watch 'em and that's one of the things I was concerned about a couple of months ago is that there might be three or five or even ten percent of Republicans\nWho are thinking about voting for that too 'cause they were falling falling for his spell I don't think that's the case anymore and capital has radicalized a lot of Republicans because we do not want to give Democrats any power so they can even go further than they did in trying to attack of this decent and good and an honest person\nYou took me right where I wanted to go because we have been from Texas politics and how it all plays out nationally and you know this blue wave it's threatening to wipe out taxes this blue way that's threatening to wipe out America\nIt it is really been diminished in my mind at least as far as polling showing and just your general feeling public perception let me go down the list here you've got Cory Booker out there\nSaying that Canada does America better than Canada or any uh Canada's American better than America does\nSo conscious with her DNA debacle that blew up in her face\nYou got the Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent standard you've got Democrats actually saying there is no presumption of innocence in America and people are reports even folks who are moderate Democrats on their side are certainly persuadable independence how\nMuch do you believe the Democrats extremism is undermining their their blue wave\nYeah it's a great question and I think it will I look I think they'd been extreme for the last year and a half at least\nA trumped arrangements syndrome is now something you can diagnose um but but it really didn't didn't catch on and get traction and become sort of undeniable to the public until the capital here in ...\nUh and I don't even know if it was it was ridiculous but have it from the Democrats in the community as much as it was these protesters\nUm the rights to peacefully protest is one of the great things about America but you know you know sending a sending poisonous material to the home of the U.S senator or publishing home addresses of US Senators or trying to break open ended the Supreme Court are all these ridiculous things thrown people out to restaurants\nUm that's not what most people believe is is fair and reasonable and writing America true and so to see the Democrats a break the confidentiality of Dr Ford for their own political purposes and then\nCreate these other two stories in a way to try to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh not because they didn't like Brett Kavanaugh but because they were worried about the future of the Supreme Court roe versus Wade or to see them be willing to go to ... to ... to that depth\nI think really woke a lot of people a look at ... scares me truly scares me that Democrats could have any control and every any power in January that should scare everyone out there listening you guys ran out you've got to vote straight ticket Republican you got to help these candidates it's so crucial in so important\nI agree and we didn't even men we didn't get to a left wing violence going out and showing up to prayer marches and kicking the garbage out of conservatives Matt McCovey I everybody GOP

an awful long time welcome to the question and said oh sure let's say you\nChris good morning or do you want to me um I just wanted to fight then I'm myself I was born in Ninety One of the millennials technically yeah and the main point I just want to make it with every person who grows up in the United\nUm you know generally speaking your views come from you know your child and your young adult life and as you grow up and become an adult and solidify those huge\nHere whatever current events are wherever you live those events really have a formative you know impact on who you become and hurled view that you adopt so I think you know what you're talking to the gym the kids are young adults\nSo I think you know what you're talking about the ... the kids are young adults what they're seeing is craziness and is ridiculous atmosphere them live\nPay Peter by the way when you get closer to a window I'm a ... a year of your cell phone's cutting out I'm probably every third or fourth word I just want to make sure the folks can here and understand you let me let me as you're moving let me just take up some of the airtime here and just say\nThat yeah I I there's a lot of wisdom to what you're saying about people being formed about the generations they come up and and I don't know that\nI I guess I'm gratified in one sense is that some of these these young adults see the behavior of Democrats that we that we've articulated in go I don't want any part of that now there are there are some that are highly impressionable that will that they don't have that foundational\nA grounding from home and look to the so called leaders and take their cue from those so called leaders and that's what's scary\nYeah and I I completely agree can you hear me better now yes I can\nOkay well so that's that's a big point and I also think that you know you look at the the demographics of the United states um by age and the baby boom generation must have been because it was such a large increase in the population all once\nAnd that the influence that that generation had was proportional to sort of the sides of that age group\nAnd since we've had decreasing sizes of a subsequent generations the\nEach pulse of a new generation and the views that they bring in into the change that they bring to the country has been marginal compared to that baby boom generation so when you talk about the baby boomers have a bigger influence I think that's a definite possibility surely because of the number\nOnline and I'm not I'm not talking about the the the the numbers per se because right now the millennial generation is bigger\nThan the baby boom generation there there are there is a more population there so it's sizes necessarily concern me it's what ideas and the culture slashed government advance in those particular generation and the idea is that we find acceptable as a culture in\nIn the Nineteen forties this idea of rolling up on your political opposition and shouting them down and driving them out of political office\nThat would have been that would have been unheard of that would have been that would have been a complete lack of decorum and now as you see that what I Would rationalize the evolution that has happened to the baby boom Generation Z\nA stewardship if you will of the country now all of a sudden you've got Democrat leaders openly calling for it\nYeah I don't know that's I don't know it's a good thing let me just say that\nYeah and I I I totally agree I think in today's day and age I Can't speak to necessarily the past and how we got here but I think social media entertainment and all the amount of time that people spend\nActually per day you know eight nine hours a day or allowing themselves to interact with that and as a result interaction leads to influence or whatever they're interacting with it influencing their opinion in their behavior and I think that's part of what we're seeing right now\n... and Peter my big my big worry is somebody gonna get killed\nAll all of these folks in the basket of biased press who are sitting on the sidelines not calling out Hillary Clinton not calling out Sheila Jackson leaves office not calling out Maxine Waters not calling out Eric Holder the Lincoln the non from ABC NBC CBS and the local affiliates and your local affiliates and Fox\nIs that and I gotta say Fox News channel is going to a bang up job I'm saying you know at least asking the question is this the right thing to do somebody's going to get killed\nAnd and and one gets the sense\nThat nobody in these in those bastions that I just mentioned would care because they're unhappy\nThere actually seem to be pulling for somebody to die so that in the country knows how unhappy they are so that we will reverse course and stop all this pro Americanism stop all this great economy stop Donald Trump stop ah cutting taxes\nAnd and give Democrats their power back that seems to be\nThe price that they are trying to exact Peter thank you very much for the call and it's dangerous I think it's dangerous\nAnd I just I Can't get behind it my friends I Can't I'm\nTelephone number two one five eight five seven three two one five eight K. as easy Lewis Black you waited welcome to say to show\n\nI'm a baby boomer and out and then I think with the uh there's a difference in the fifties in the mid ... and above but I'll tell you what the perfect example of what the baby boomers there that that would just go and Portland\nThose are the people that ran accommodations and nine in ... and they're turning those cities in the army\nLook at I mean the the the the ... the conservatives be hacked to letting the police then decide that that that goes a toilet now are you afraid to walk the streets or the cat whatever diseases out there\nHad been durable example yeah Hi you're on a toilet\nNot only that they've got to know them into tens of thousands all over the city now now that you know\nI Know that they've got somebody what it is you know they have you\nThey hired and folks out their lowest they've hired folks on taxpayers' dollars to clean up all the human feces they invited in with their accommodating drug policy now yeah but you know that's that is that the head coach of the exact ... baby boomers run San Francisco can we said that's a good thing\nLegitimate right though thank you bye thank you very much Steve ... talking about this on Fox and friends today he taken out an op ed\n... crying what the Democrats have done\nCongressman it says is they forgot what happened to you you almost feel bleeding to death to second base because of Bernie Sanders supporters thought he had to kill Republicans so they understand that these two range people just need to go sign and there are a great question could be the trigger\nFor you know you're seeing more and more of this from the left and and there's no place for them what I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is an exciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about there were a great country\nThat's that celebrates the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there's a way to resolve it you resolve differences at the ballot box you'd don't resort to violence and to see leaders calling on violence that happens in third world nations not in America\nSo again I asked a question if\nA billboards we've got billboards running in the Dallas Fort Worth area and ah also now this week in San Antonio is well\nFlashing different messages about fraud or ... who claims to be Hispanic for it is a and I think what we got fed up with you know and and it's not like he ever says that he's Hispanic\nYou know but he never really says that he is in either this is the same trick that the media plays\nAnd the way the media does this this is particularly why we have these billboards ride a we have actually one running in Spanish essentially tally voters hey\nUh Robert O'Rourke you know he's\nNot fat [laughter] and that when he was arrested he you know he uses the name Robert when it's convenient and and then if\nA veto thing that he he throws out there is when is when it's getting me for that as well but the media coverage the widow slanted is they'll say you know works\nYou know chances depend on Hispanic turnout you know it and if a Texas is finally become\nYou know a huge you know if the if the static bases finally been woken up then they'll vote for work and every time I see that I just hit the feeling because it excuse me the current senator\nSenator Ted Cruz is Hispanic\n[laughter] is zero percent Hispanic fear right now so\nThat is what we have right they are right now in a so so central\nYet don't forget in the last election the last ... election lieutenant governor and the governor of the the great state of Texas Greg Abbott and\nThen Patrick they garnered fifty six percent fifty six fifty four percent of the male Latino votes so this idea that the Latino Hispanics or as stupid as the basket of biased press thinks they are\nI think they're in for a rude awakening come election day as far as Hispanic turnout for\nA while and I we called beta beta or work because he he's ... he's a beta mail each class in he's he's not like Donald Trump or a fighter like Ted Cruz off over time talking to 'em um prime alone immediate equalizer they put up a couple of billboards here\nIn the state of Texas I'm In Spanish as you heard to to basically ... to\nTo light the criminal record of beta or working by the way I got to remind you Brian an inch criminality continues the FCC has filed a charges against his campaign for taking among other things foreign donations a which is again once a criminal always a criminal in my mind\nAre you guys are not only focusing on our range so you guys are focusing another key rights\nWhile we are we're also looking at Florida we're also looking into that at Arizona but I guess we started with taxes because it's the one that makes us angry is I think just\nThe feet and and the fraud and you know the way that our work has been turned into this year the by the media that X Kennedy\nUm but we're also desperately in in Florida as well because Andrew Gillum is running for governor there he is Obama's hand picked\nA governor running on extreme left way or you know stances\nSo we've got some really ... it was amazing to me about this election is there are a couple of dozen big races that are neck and neck that if we really stepped up our efforts as conservatives right now they're all wind up all all of them\nSo I don't know what you know I I think if we can just get people stirred up enough here I think we can get a a we can have an incredible election day opportunities across the country we're now seeing races that we didn't have a prayer of winning just a few weeks ago now with\n... or to get a little bit of LA\nYeah because the Democrats basically shot themselves in the foot when the way they behave with cabin I'll look I'm I'm I'm honored\nAnd gratified you chose ... turn them off with all that means that means you guys have a little bit of a deficit to be able to spend those similar type billboards in advertising and then the other races you mentioned I look when what can we do as conservatives to help you guys up\n... so we are raising money uh to add more billboards the factory raise that there's still time to put up more billboards if we get going right away that just if you go to our page on Facebook at red wave America just type that yet symbol and red wave America it tells you how to donate to our campaign so that we can put up\nA bunch I mean we could even be adding more taxes billboards ... came in for that it's he's built for your digital so it's really fast to add them\nBeautiful Brian Maloney everybody editor in chief media equalizer a longtime radio host he

on the border back in World War two when we're worried about the Japanese possibly invading\nYesterday when I go to look at all the boxes bunkers down there and\nGet them to the point is these people who are saying is we're also seeing people says we can't cut spending we can't do this they're saying it because they don't want it to happen\nAbsolutely we can put troops on the border the president is the commander in chief and he gets absolutely order to put troops pretty much anywhere he wants you know right there would be a problem in starting policing American citizens this is not policing them edit American citizens they just policing\nA four thousand bullets caravan of people that are looking to invade our country color what they want to call it but that's absolutely what they're
