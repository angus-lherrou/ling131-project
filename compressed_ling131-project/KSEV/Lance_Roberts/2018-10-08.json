thing to do they go looking for an interest group that can be complained about\nRight oh they're about to screw you over about to do something to you I mean but they they they create division and we used to put a montage together and just blasted on the airwaves for the next month and say listen here's the party that is created an oldest division that so these people are so called thing this is not a good idea\nWell it's it's everything that Trump is doing right\nFrom trade to taxes\nTo judge is it ... all you need to do is look at everything that Trump has tried to do with the last two years are unwinding the administrative state on unwinding the deep state and every every move he makes is an apocalypse for the American left that's all you need to look back on your Facebook thread\nLadies and gentlemen and you'll you'll see these these people\nThat the American left I watched my Facebook feed yesterday they they are on hinged and all I keep saying is I Hope you folks keep it up I hold me keep on doing this stuff because you people are crazy and now everybody seeing it\nI think what what I what I Want the folks to understand is so I I consider myself a conservative as a conservative I I Can't stand politics I Would rather just be left alone right Emmy to confer early on and services\nThat we don't go out and pick fights we don't grow claw at the Supreme Court door winter when a nominee we don't agree with that if we don't go pick fights will fight the fight if the Democrats want to do something real life but I'm not I'm not going out there looking for a reason to be your day to do something to go fight about it and that's the difference either\nI'm not looking to divide that the conservative Tom ... as a conservative don't you want to United States\nBut the left can't win with the United states right so that's why it's always with them divide conquer it's all with them it's always special interest group here in a special interest group there and this this aggrieved party and not agree party they never concentrate on what unites us as an American do they\nI\nI mean I mean that's that's the single biggest\nFocus I think we can take into the twenty Eighteen midterms who's talking unified who's talking about living up to our\nOur full potential as Americans there's only one side and it's barely that sucked the conservative movement is always consistent on that message and we have to drag the Republicans kicking and screaming to carry the message\nThe other side they don't it's all about\nMuslim issues gay issues this outside group as you this outside group issue or\nThe courts and and there was no there is no norm that they will\nStay away from to undermine in the United states to achieve their political goals I ... I I Want you to remember this and keep bringing this up to your left wing friends you were willing to destroy innocent until proven guilty to get your way I Can't trust your people\nI Can't trust Democrats because you were willing to sacrifice my presumption of innocence for your political goals\nIntimate folks that that's a step too far\nAway one five eight seven three eight to eight one five I can see Julie I appreciate your patience welcoming jumps into show\nHey I'm a lead what a senator Collins yet but I I Do have one thing that I don't agree with and to some extent um is\nSaying that yeah so that did happen to a different President Ford you know she glacier that a lot of sexual assault I I just don't um\nI don't know I'm I'm I'm just saying she seems like that but I Can't I Can't prove it one way or the other\nRight but I and I don't think that she did not I think that she wanted to keep her name secret I think\nEverything that happened is the way that they wanted it to happen oh I've heard of that is from when they ask her in the hearing a how what percentage where she sure that uh Kavanaugh was the one who is often her and she said one hundred percent because everything else was I don't\nKnow I'm not no I'm not sure I'm not sure he didn't do it she lives she lives so she's ... she's lying about everything else I think it all calculated and she lost as the\nPresident said she also remembered how many beer and she had yeah\nLine or a drinker yeah and yeah\nI got her age and I was assaulted when I was in hospital and I can tell you the day the town I could tell you what people are aware and I can tell you who is there and I'm like I said I'm her age and I forgot one single thing about it so\nYou know there are a lot of women there are a lot of women out there who say the same thing who who who don't find you know what I\n... and I've been heartened and I'm as as a man I haven't been buttressed by women like you Julie who have called on this program written this program saying I I as a woman do not believe her and and so so many women all over this country just didn't find her credible I mean I\n... my my contention was she went through something traumatic but I don't think it was ... at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh as a matter of\nI was driving these yesterday from our rover shame yard sign twice\nI found it was a show it was an all male and a democratic I could not believe that yeah I voted for Trump\n[laughter] well I I think the the other side with every success\nThe other side sees us America having and they've grown more and more unhinged this isn't what the Democrats want they don't want low unemployment they don't want rising wages they don't want and American people that are not dependent on government\nAnd with every with every success of the individual the individual field gets farther and farther and farther away from government\nAnd the Democrats hate it and they hate it\nI I you know one of my pet peeves was issued in the yard ... vote democratic sorry the term is vote\nDemocrat yeah I'm a Democrat and the Democrats have nothing to do with any Democrat or America\nWell I mean look at their philosophy their philosophy is a democratic their philosophy is vote for us and we'll rule over you that that's that's their idea of democracy\nThat's correct yes yeah exactly on them now I\nThink you might appreciate it telephone number is up to any one five I made by seven three eggs are your thoughts on T.

Rodriguez reasons that we ruining the lord senators and representatives to a conservative ones\nTo aid president curled in what he wants to do\nYou know there's a woman you know this woman Murkowski she got she got up there and said she had to vote her conscience oh my God that's all fine but the fact that her conscience was informed by a bunch of hearsay and refuted accusations\nI mean that saying that I'm voting my conscience shouldn't\nAh exempt you from having to make factual decisions as a U.S senator but this this woman this woman voter conscience and um her her gender rather than voting the facts bravo to Susan Collins was saying I'm going to look actually\nAt the situation and I'm not going to ... I'm not going to be ruled by emotion and or Murkowski said I'm going to be ruled by emotion\nThat's facts hot over there you go\nWith that but we're ... why she do it for five she's a Democrat and she just trying to put up a you know let's take on a good thing to look a little better\nThan the ... year right Bob thank you Lisa Murkowski is a fraud you're absolutely right Peter thank you for waiting glad you are made here the original the it'll show\nFor it I just wanted to stay real quick that I'm twenty seven years old I just\nNever yesterday and I had ever\nExpedition in that time or you know I I've met a Democrat my whole life I was raised a Democrat my whole family is\nAnd I switch before the election I canvassed for Obama and then during the twenty six he run up and over and over again\nThe oil or Clinton [noise] ... totally changed my perspective on everything and now I Am a proud commonsense voter which just happy to be Republican and conservative right now\nIt might be going over how does that go over at home can I ask\nYou absolutely made it depends on the brother or sister um and it's definitely created a lot of tension friction in the family\nFor sure and not everybody understands that they're trying to do and all I Do is you know answering questions they asked me and ah yeah it's interesting situation\nNow I just want to make let me ask you as a as a former Democrat\nAnd and if you've had this conversation with your ... this is fascinating to me oh hopefully I can pick your brain um when when you approach you and I can tell me if you have or not if slash when you approach your family's saying guys\nYou guys cannot be on board with the suspension of the presumption of innocence to win a political battle are you what did they say or I Do not even broach the topic yet\nThat topic my main thing is that I don't bring up more and bring it up and I respond to it and that and then my policy and it only way I have a functional relationship with members of my family\nYou know you're not alone I've got good friends\nSwing Democrat but after the election of Trump\nI mean it it is it is I Can't be who I Am around them\nElse they're ... they have completely lost rationality I can rise above and love them\nNo matter who they are for who they are whether they'd be liberals are Democrats and I can still because the personal relationships are there they can't do the term for me\nYeah and I think that is I have a neighbor same thing with him a little bit older than me but we we talk about this time and it's just something that you get used to do\nAnd it gives you a new perspective on how to live your life better than others not to say you're a better person that just\nActing and treating others you'd want to be treated\nRight so you have switched to\nRepublican or an hour you conservative or do you consider yourself a Republican\nI don't consider myself a public and I consider myself I guess of values which happens to line up Republican and that's my point uh currently which is\nWill use at home in the fall or you go out and vote and when you get as many people inside of your sphere of influence to get off there doesn't do the same it's only the Republicans stay close\nTo I Want five eight five seven three eight to eight one five at a KFC be read appreciate your waiting welcome to shell say it'll show\nYou're more than ... anti littering\nHas as anyone a drawn a parallel between Russia collusion and the Kavanaugh here\nBut things are the only uh arguments them to have these days 'cause they don't work on facts the motion and um I just thought that was interesting uh two major events during Trump's rather than the the the current courtesy of them\nI think you are on I think I Know where you're going with this but what do you mean how are you linking\nThe that Russia there there that the Russia or a hysteria and and the Kavanaugh nomination\nWe'll just see there are a lot of holes a and both of the arguments are\nReally the facts are before we really strict conclusions and I feel so bad for Dr Ford or shoes just totally used by the Democrats are there's no doubt something as a nerve itself into\nA very good statistic went out of three women would be just a sad state of our society and culture or we need a\nUm God Almighty and everyone parts and that is a somewhat of this you know world these days\nSo I Know I I I agree with that and remember that this is why the Democrats why I Believe Democrats can do what they do\nBecause they're got his government that's why I Believe read there is no prompting other Democrat conscience because that they uh they don't believe in God like you and I do\nThey don't they don't believe he's always watch it they don't they don't believe in a conscience that's\nAnd I know I Know I'm painting with a rather broad brush but\nI I mean I Can't think of any ... elected Democrat and I'm not talking about you rank and file Democrats who do live your life will go to church when I Will say about you rank and file Democrats as you've never imagine yourself against the conduct of those who you elected\nBut I Believe these Democrats in government Al Green Sheila Jackson Lee others have now claimed to a conscience how could they do what they are doing\nIf they actually had a conscience or American economy is roaring can't have any of that that's good for the people\nThe regulatory state is gone or severely dismantled all can have it out I mean more freedom for the people can't have any that wages are rising oh my gosh you can't credit government for that got to get rid of that more jobs higher wages\nStanding up to the nuclear power of North Korea getting out of an agreement that was going to make the number one state sponsor of terror nuclear power oh God not pat there's too much pro Americanism going on here we oppose pro Americanism say the Democrats\nBecause when you're pro American when you're pro constitution you limit the government's power and they can't they can't abide that my friends they they won't abide that\nWe'd rather statue you earlier but unemployment inside a well since the Vietnam War unemployment hasn't been this low Nineteen sixty nine percent\nHispanic unemployment black unemployment at historic lows Hispanic unemployment rate hits the lowest level on record in September\nWe're working and a lot of Americans like to work\nLatinos blacks whites you know Americans they like to work they liked the dignity of work Democrats can't have any of that no no no no need to have welfare need to have people dependent\nAnd hopefully we'll take it out on them in the fall now you don't represent America the Democrat Party has represented America and an awful long time\nTo I Want five eight seven three eight to eight one five at a KFC hello Tony glad you may have the say it'll show let's say you\nKnow first of all Chris was somebody on welfare call a bonus [laughter]\nWhat is it that\nThat would be working for cash or just\nOK yeah the ... the sorrows cash bonus\nExactly yeah you know I was thinking you know John McCain was still alive and into ... there's a good chance cat or know wouldn't have been nominated to the Supreme Court and the reason why I say that it\nSeems like a the Republicans now that you don't have a little more about um [noise] so ... she either had too much influence on them\nOr are you there certainly are known them because we know he would have been working hard for the immigrants to keep ...\nYeah I think I think there's some wisdom what you're saying there Tony and also look at the impact that his passing has left the Lindsey Graham and I think this is and again I I don't want to put Lindsey Graham on on the psychologist couch but I think that\nThat John McCain's impassioned pleas for for unity\nCountry that are remembered what our traditions were like I think that when Lindsey Graham saw the Democrats roll with it\nTraditions were like I think that when Lindsey Graham saw the Democrats or what they pulled with cab and all that he thought that was that was offensive to the memory of John McCain I honestly believe it now I Know that a lot of these\nModerate Republicans have this this view of John McCain did have some sort of\nUltra fair guy and not just the liberal and disguise uh but I I really do believe that Lindsey Graham's pain from losing his friend informed his his anger and the Democrats for for doing what he thought they were doing which was this honoring the member memory of John McCain\nJohn McCain and
