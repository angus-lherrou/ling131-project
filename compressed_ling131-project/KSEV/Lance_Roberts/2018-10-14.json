F. C. V. is a free call on your eyes and so Steve is\nSo you'd be is a free call on your eyes and so Steve is what is looking at a home\nWith a pool he wants to change the shape and all of that and you heard me talking about sometimes sometimes it's better just to rip out the pool and start over not always though not always especially in areas where the ground so expansive\nSoil is so expensive oh my gosh uh once you have a pool that's already settled in\nAnd it's been there for a long time and it's not moving that's kind of a good thing but\nWhat what what sparked my memory to talk to you about is pool inspections you know a lot of the uh home inspectors offer that service as well with the with the home inspection but they're not pools guys\nYou know what I mean I mean they've been trained on not putting the inspectors down by any means because I have a lot of respect for them and I've seen a lot of their of their inspection reports then you know quite frankly they're they're pretty good but\nThey they don't go quite as deep as a pool professional does like Texan pools Tom's got a whole department where he he does inspections I don't do that many but we have a I Do the inspections myself I'd say my tax out there they gave me the report and then I I seem to report to you\n[noise] um but\nIt's it's critical if you're thinking of buying a house it's got a swimming pool in it\nEven if the pool is was built a year or two ago you still you still should get a pool professional to do an inspection back there you'll it'll benefit I Know it's a little bit more money but believe me it could said you I don't even know how much your closing\nTo eight one five five eight five seven three eight\nPounds KFC is a free call on your horizons so we started to get a little cooler weather I Know it's supposed to get cooler next week I Hope it does\nBut as I've been bragging the last few weeks I started out a whole different workout routine in my swimming pool well I didn't share with you all my little little secret weapon for getting in the pool when it's a little chilly\nI always heat up the spa first\nAnd I happen to spot I sit in there for about five minutes to get real hot and toasty you know\nAnd then I hop into the colder pool and it's really pretty refreshing it's it feels pretty good and then I start working out and by the time you start working out you know ... as you do you do sweat in your swimming pool you know that right\nYeah even though you can't feel it it is not running down your face like like it does when you're on the treadmill or you're running a are you working in the yard you are sweating in your swimming pool and your body temperature warms up and a as a matter of fact\nIs is that I could use the trivia question the next few weeks 'cause we're getting into trivia question time of year because it's a it's getting closer to the time when everybody's thinking about other things in their swimming pool [laughter] although I don't know why I think about my swimming pool everyday\nOh yeah that's right 'cause that's my business that's what I Do for a living [laughter]\nBut um now now I've just lost my train of thought I'm\n... you want to uh I uh well ... if it probably wasn't that important I'll come back to it if you minutes but the point is is that I get I get my ... all hot and toasty\nAnd then I get into a swimming pool I Do my little workout and usually working out for about forty five minutes and the pool which is great I'm so proud of yeah I'm bragging I Know you're tired of hearing me talk about all that but I feel great uh looking better I I don't know I think I looked pretty great too [laughter]\nBut after I'm done\nTo spawn still running oh yeah baby so I get in there and do than other five minutes or so with all the ah hydro therapeutically jets kind of easing those muscles now that I've been working out so hard All right I'm\nOkay that's a good question okay what is it safe temperature for warming a spies that's a question that you have Gary there's not a caller on the line is there okay All right so that's a good question so what is it safe temperature for heating up your spouse so the the\nUm the heaters are limited to only get the water up to a hundred and four degrees\nSo that's as high as you want the water temperature to be that is a safe it is hot it's hot baby I'm telling you now it's not as hot when it's forty degrees outside but when it's eighty five degrees outside it's pretty hot so I normally run ... at around a hundred\nAnd I think I found most people are are are in that little hundred range as well\nBut\nThe American Red Cross actually recommends deed and get this are you ready for this the best temperature of a swimming\nPool to exercise in the water temperature is what do you think what do you think eighty five\nNo eighty seven old do going the wrong way okay let's say eighty two nope Seventy eight yeah\nUh that's that's pretty chilly alright uh I've got another caller so I'm going to postpone the break here Robert welcome to the back yard by radio program how can I help you buddy\nI just got a new pool how could a regulation I think you\nAre trying to figure out as the as the four feet I have a variable feed a a word of\n... like the old older I get better at it for two hours at about Seventy five percent and for another six hours at a hundred percent okay try to figure out whether I Need you running at you know for a hundred percent all that time are and how many hours of the actually require it\nVery good question [noise] so I'm not as familiar with the Hayward variable speed pumps as I Am with the ... but that's okay\nI Do I Do know about the variable speeds and do you have just a pool spawn combination for this okay good so uh so you have a controller\nI'm that motto\nSave you a little time save your money make sure you're never frustrated with anything you're swimming pool truly is the reason that I wanted to do this radio show back over Seventeen years ago\nAnd I realize that having a swimming pool in your backyard is the very best thing you could ever do for you and your family\nI mean even if you're just you
