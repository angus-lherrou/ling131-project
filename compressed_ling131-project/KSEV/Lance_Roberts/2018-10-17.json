last ... put in\nOh I really I wouldn't have thought about putting them in not in that situation is not an entire game\nInvolved in it you\nInvolved in the\nDivision that we're supposed to be\nOne of the top division this year in the NFL with the improvements you know of course with Jacksonville and tendency both go into the playoffs last season\nAnd then the Texans with all the expectations they had this year\nI Can't get it done now granted they've won three in a row\nAlbeit wins against the pitiful Indianapolis Colts who gave the Texans that gift by the way if you remember but\nRegardless of when the when\nThe other win against the Dallas Cowboys in an ugly game that will play here and then of course beating a pitiful Buffalo Bills saying\nNothing to brag about\nFor a Texan team that often simply has no problems moving the ball\nBetween the twenties\nWithin gets in the red zone they're still the despite their inefficiency this past week they are still behind or I should say just still just ahead of the New York jets\nAnd the red zone efficiency\nCategory and the national football league it's they are thirty first in the NFL\nIn swing a touchdown just thirty four percent of the time\nIn over the last two games between Dallas and buffalo the Texans are too for ten\nHad the Texans just if they could just be fifty percent\nHave they been five of ten or ... or even six for Tim but we'll just go fired for ten for now and those two games those two games aren't even close\nThey would have won those games easily\n... wouldn't have been over time against Dallas\nAnd it wouldn't come down to what it came down to negotiate pick six to win the game against buffalo\nAnd kj hits that Trojan\nCoaching and then of course execution by the team for sure\nBelow Brian yet again trying that\nGimmick play again with what Kiki cruelty that yeah\nYou know what it works the first time\nBut to try it again\nThe very next week\nYeah think buffalo didn't see that on film\nI mean my goodness\nWe have gained film that we use to prepare\nAgainst our opponents with our ten and eleven year olds are fourth and fifth graders\nTake buffalo didn't see that one coming\nFirst and goal from the one yard line\nAnd they had to kick a field goal\nHad to keep your field goal\nAnd that tied the game against buffalo\nAnd have the Texans are are on the road against Jacksonville this week uh jaguars team and the Tennessee Titans both of those teams reeling in\nThe AFC South as the titans and the jaguars both onto game losing streaks the Colts on a ... game losing streak and the taxes are taking advantage of the weakness of their schedule\nHave won three in a row the good thing is I Will say this about the facts of this point is that at least here we are a week seven and\nAll of the key players\nOn the Texas roster are still healthy knock on wood I Hope I didn't just jinx it they're still healthy\nThe office of wine is not going to fix itself\nIt is what it is and it's going to be that way the season I don't see it getting better\nWhich didn't puts it on the head coach who is the off into coordinator\nTo find a way to\nOffset some of the deficiencies of this offensive line to help to solve it succeed\nAnd that's all on bill O'Brian because he wants to be the guy\nWho is certainly catching Jacksonville at the right time to where the plane but boy I just feel like this week I I Do not have a good feeling about this week game only because I feel like Jacksonville in that defense with all the pride that they have and the talent that they have\nI feel like Jacksonville and not be friends with all the pride that they have and the talented they have\nThey are going to be looking to bounce back in a big way the question is do what was her off and do that without litter formats offer Jacksonville who no doubt it's going to be a no go again this week there's all sorts of struggling\nMean that was a big key reason for their turn around last year and why they were such a good football team last season it was because of the running gave her litter for that\nAnd that was getting a lot of the game to get put back on the shoulders of Blake morals\nI could go to the ... now they've got to find themselves a new quarterback\nAnd hopefully the habit so they can continue losing\nIn the years to go with like morals fantastic\nJust one on a few teams up

you\nSpecifically but there was an embargo we put yourself in the course I'll say to show Facebook page last night there was an embargo and some of the biggest markets in Texas where the only place you could hear the debate which was a state wide office for senator of\nIn the United States Congress representing Texas and ten markets work tag now has television stations it was a complete blanket embargo\nNow I can understand stopping other TV stations from airing it to a point\nBut blocking that radio too\nSo we were forged because of the nature of where our studio was located we were forced to listen on line\nTo this debate and the strain was horrific it was horrific shops and starch and our glass thing\nI mean it it was just it was terrible the audio quality was poor so each salvage eleven soundbites\nFrom this debate last night but about I got to be honest with you two thirds of the way through I grew I grew so frustrated with the an apt stream from techno I just gave up just gave up it was toward the latter third of the debate we're all of a silly questions started coming out you know\nTell us about who you are the human being those types of questions\nUm\nBut I cannot I cannot tell you how ... was that a media company who was who had their personalities hosting\nThis debate would restrict access to a debate that impacts all the taxes and then it hit me and Russell I said a draw in the morning while was so upset he said it\nAnd you guys on line said it when I posted it and just I didn't even think about this I was so worried about hey come on state wide it's just it's a Senate race\nEverybody ought to be able to hear it because the policies affect every tax and there should be anybody who wants to carry it should be able to carry it this isn't the time to drive the profit motive I'd put my signage up behind the moderators I Would a script in some\nUh plugs for my station that's all well and good that's great you know promote that it was your media company that score the debate I have no problem with that\nYou know for example if slash when we get the president to come on to the court shelter it'll show we will up we will allow every other station in the market to take the debate live that ...\nBecause he's the president of the United states I Would I Would open up to take it I mean I I Know that it's necessarily all my call but I Would recommend\nAny station that I'm working at hey come on if the president what everybody here it limit everybody take the ... I Would say that now when I say like that you're all like well yeah 'cause that'd be great promotion for you\nExactly so it doesn't make any good business sense\nFor an hour's worth of writing that you can find to your own audience and maybe you drove some other people to turn off the other channels on television but they were watching to you for an hour\nBut then all those folks who were forced to listen on line and those who had to be in front of the radio I couldn't hear it all you just take them off\nSo don't necessarily take it out on page you folks it was it was a decision made above their head I'm sure can't show you would want to be a good media partner to radio here in I'm In Houston and if it was their call they would have shared\nThe tagging the didn't but Russell and many of you said there's a reason why ...

once you change from pro choice pro life you'd never go back because you see an evil you understand the evil your eyes are open to it but I can um I I Want to urge willing to have compassion a lot of these women don't have somebody\nTo help them understand that there is a light at the end of the tunnel the baby will not be having a baby will not be the end of the world for them and\nMany of them have been able to build a good ... they don't even understand that it really is a baby they've been told and I understand that from my own experience it was just a bunch of cells right and um [laughter]\nI Know they weren't the defining moment for a couple of defining moments for me when I was pregnant with my first child um I found out that she was down\nShe tested for Down syndrome oh and I I was completely devastated because\nI've not because they didn't want to raise a baby that with Down syndrome but I felt such guilt because I waited so long to me that you know become a mother and I felt like you know how could I Do this child long story short it was a math there she went online my second child was also tested\nPositive for a down well this time you know I wasn't gonna I there was no reason to take the test I found out that\nThey just want to quote unquote prepare you for the eventuality and so you can make an informed decision\nAnd I went in God and so I waited till\nWell wait a minute I'll know are are false positives an informed decision\nExactly and also why why are you encouraged I think this is where all these late term abortions are coming from\nDid you go now to fry did\nWhat what did you think of them do why do you think that local stations ABC NBC CBS Fox they're not covering that or even the national folks and not covering gods now why not\nFor the same reason that I finally the final nail in the coffin for me with being pro abortion pro murder is I was I was pregnant with my first child and I was reading an article in the magazine about a ... and I witnessed that was in al Schmitz\nAnd she witnessed a woman that was had a forced abortion and then the Nazis played with the baby like as a soccer ball so I was ... yeah and I was completely horrified and it began to think well why it's just a bunch of south\nThat's what happens when you do humanize\nAnd clean the unborn or even those who are alive right now\nIt completely open my eyes it allows you to you know ready to\nYou know you they they label those with whom they politically the degree Nazis and you know why they do that so they they are justified and kicking the living ... you could do anything to anybody you dehumanize and that's how the American left roles right now it's it's sick\nAnd I want to say to the person that said you know and I'm Glad that you spoke up about how he said well we should embrace abortion because the liberals will be the ones having um [noise]\nThat's not that's not they're not their choice to choose to live and die and that is what the abortion lobby really is about is to choose who will live and die eventually they just have to get past the point you have\nA ... point you made money Kathy respect for the abortion lobby wants to make money for Democrats that's that's their main event\nAnd the Democrats are all about control you know he goes all the way to Margaret Sanger there you know she wanted to take away yeah the ...\nThe founder of Planned Parenthood is one of the biggest racist in history\nI'm wanting to wipe out the entire black population it's a it's a it's a sick legacy and it's one of the basket of
