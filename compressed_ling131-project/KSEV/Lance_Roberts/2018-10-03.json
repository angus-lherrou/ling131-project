about\nAbout a mentality that would do that I Want you to think\nI mean we all know where they sit on defense you know oh if if the if the radicalized Islamic fundamentalists terrorists are angry well don't attack some because you'll only make them angrier just sit back and wait for them to attack you that's the Democrat way of doing things\n\nAnd the the very idea oh we need to stop what whether it's out of revenge or we don't want a constitutional court we've got to stop Brett Kavanaugh even if we have to say that there was no longer a presumption of innocence in America\nHow many how long do you all think it'll be before your neighborhood Democrat comes after you and how many of you Democrats and how many liberals out there are on board with this well so long as I Am a Democrat and they never come after me [laughter]\nWell as well I guess as long as you agree with Dianne Feinstein and Chuck tumor I guess you'll be safe government is good government is good don't you dare don't you dare stray or they'll the power you give them they'll gonna use it to come after you\nThat's not America that's not the United states of America is not constitutional republic that's something different and I oppose it and I'll Fight it every step of the way\nWhat about you what about you women out there\nTo a one time I make seven three eight Mike I appreciate your patience walk themselves they don't show\nThat you ministers and say I want to tell you I really appreciate your show I look forward to listening to it all those drive in the mornings I appreciate market Alan edge comments and and thirty seconds I Want to say I'm just a little frustrated though that conservatives\nYou tend to fall for the media smokescreen and I'll tell you three\nThree quick ways one\nHeart is about the FBI investigations are realize the Democrats have already done their investigation say they're not going to find anything and I know but\nAll this going on in their salary for time you can bet they're investigating every Republican senator and every every Democrat Senator that might affect and looking for a shake and their background\nEthic they've already founded in flight but they're failing off votes they're using the time to do that and they'll have a you know I heard it\nTime to do that and they'll keep doing that or you\nKnow I I heard it observe that the weak link in the United states is just like\nYeah yeah there there's more anybody anything in there they're fine and\nThe other thing that bothers me a quick thing chasing a two or one is the heart of out of losing roe versus Wade and the chance overturned that um you realize that\nPointing to toss a constitutional cost of ... the Supreme Court and being concerned that he would overturn roe versus Wade is just a clear indication that they understand that roe versus Wade is not a solution all else there will be no concerns about\n... ... well it's it's it's an over ... by the high court you know who said it Justice Ginsburg probably one of the most unqualified most liberal extremists to ever sit on the high court she even said the ... when the high court made their decision Mike and took it out of the hands of the people they set off\nThey set off a an atmosphere in the United states that have us at each other's throat on that issue of killing children in utero and even she recognizes it and the Democrats know\nThat that a constitutional court would say that was just an overreach and that decision needs to be overturned because it's not up to us to make law on the high court it's up to us to interpret law now Congress wants to pass a law that makes abortion on demand legal then go ahead and do it\nBut it shouldn't be up to nine people in robes to take the decision making process out of the representatives of the people's hands and that's what happened with roe versus Wade once you're going to\nHave a thousand ... ... the other thing is the third accuser that talks about the gang raping the the nine times she went to the parties and the time that she was the victim yes she's back travelling by the way\nThat the that that assessed ready to have the time she never found the police report\nIt does she was she was an adult\nIn a minor party where she said she saw drugs she saw alcohol and she saw rape not once but ten times and she was an adult illegal adult and I believe she has legal culpability and anybody that were that [laughter] and these parties don't exist but by this is all be asked my admitted they did they never happened up but\nShe has legal culpability\nIn my estimation plus she's backtracking big time\nShe has perjured herself in sworn testimony and her her interviews with NBC News proof she perjured himself and many like Alan Dershowitz Democrats\nAre saying she needs to be made an example of to protect men to protect your son's\nYour grand sons your husband's from these types of false accusations for political gain she needs to be made an example of and you know what now we've got\nThis the first Kavanaugh accuser lying under oath\nHer ex boyfriend saying oh yeah he helped her prep for a polygraph\nAnd she said I have no idea what a polygraph is she testified that under oath bill thank you for a wedding welcome the cells they don't show\nHello um one thing I wanted to sponsor you asked a question\nAbout can you take me off speaker phone just because there's an echo\nOkay yeah I'm Glad you asked about what the responsibility of Christians would be and whether I'm\nYou know there should be prosecution in the case that uh this accuser is determined to perjure yourself mhm if you look in Romans chapter Thirteen and the apostle Paul says if the responsibility of the government is to punish evil doer\nAnd in the book of Amos and the Old Testament it says let justice rolls down like waters\nAnd there's many other examples but the ... I mean I Believe you have to prosecute these people because that's the only way this nonsense who's going to stop\nI start with Diane Feinstein to be honest with you I think I agree I think Dianne Feinstein even though she was an under oath I think and Ted Cruz when he was on with that said that there are many senators are who are or\nWho believe in fairness who are calling for Dianne Feinstein to be investigated so we can figure out who want her staff linked that that information to the press should have been kept confidential\nI agree and I'm hoping that night when the FBI report is actually released this evening I'm hoping there's actually a criminal referrals\nYeah me too and I hope they do it yet not only for Feinstein but for for the others you've made false false testimony bill on right\nHander would be interesting to read this could this could end up being the end of the Democratic party as we knew it because it's also possible if they're investigating Feinstein they've actually uncovered a conspiracy where other Democratic senators are in collusion with her\nTo actually forty ... this fake\nAccusation against Brett Kavanaugh if I were to be the case\nI'm Wondering whether there might actually be multiple senators expelled from the Senate\nOr you would have to believe in the integrity of the those who are leading the FBI right now under the department of justice of Jeff Sessions and attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nUh I I don't believe build they'll come to conclusions I don't believe they will have anything as detailed because their focus was on the accusations are that were leveled\nAgainst a I'd read Kevin and Kevin ... users and if if I Would be shocked if any revelations about senators were in this report by the way those thank you bill for the call\nThe FBI had said they will wrap up their investigation possibly by tonight possibly by tonight that me and Mitch McConnell we played in the soundbite yesterday he said and vote\nAnd\nHave you done to help Jeff Flake disease out there trying to lay the groundwork for a no vote\nSaying well I'm I'm a little upset that\nThat Brett Kavanaugh got political what oh no you heard me right Jeff Flake sitting with his his boy friend Chris Coons [laughter]\nSitting there saying yeah we can't have that kind of politics on\nOn the high court so Mr flick let me get this straight\nInterview as a father and husband somebody build a life\nNow that we all know that\nThe man that Brett Kavanaugh is [noise]\n'em and created a lot of money for infrastructure so that is a very creative approach we like to talk about is is that I'll be talking about tonight at the University of Houston is just this idea of all cost in all subsidies out\nFree enterprise competition in a transparent accountable marketplace\nLet me ... yell any pressure a little bit on that because my understanding\nTaxes are not costs taxes are fabricated costs by government that they don't that that's an extra burden and right now because of our ... at the economic boom I mentioned that we were having\nA demand for petroleum products an energy in general is going up what what good economic sense does it make to pile on another government an arbitrary government imposed tax on top of that was already rising costs because it's supply and demand\nBut if you go to our website republic eating out who are looking at the media tab you'll see a great clip of Milton Friedman one of Reagan's economics advisors on the field on your show in the eighties\nOr you want to do about pollution that Dr Friedman if you don't want to regulate it in ... and you know the father of modern conservatism says well you tax it of course your tax pollution\nAnd then he explains that when you have a situation where somebody doing something in their business that affects third parties having agreed to the contract and had an entered into a contract\nThat you've got to have the government stepped in and cause them to be accountable for those costs\nIf you do then you create a level playing field so my example is is I'm English coal fired electricity\nI get away with socializing much soot and my CEO to climate images I'm completely on accountable for those images and as a result it's really hard for\nRenewables to compete with me\nA great deal for me and my neighbors who have to breathe in my ... thanks for the people that will be affected by my long term climate damages but I'm happy as a clam but endless go far lectures city so how do you deal with that where you could try to regulate it\nThat's with the clean Power Plan was or you could just price it you could bring accountability to be by saying okay English you you're going to pay a tipping fee\nFor the space you're taking up in the trash dumped but this guy just like you'd have to pay a tipping for you if you are ... or to the city of Houston dump and so at that point I become accountable my price in my in the marketplace reflects my actual cost\nAnd then wind and solar don't need any props most immediate impact protection spotted way would be more natural gas being sold to customers in places like South Carolina already six coal fired plants South Carolina converting to natural gas\nRight and we are as we're a major source of that natural gas here in Texas you're right it would be an economic boom Bob Inglis our our gas right now folks former Republican congressman from South Carolina and is the executive director of republic E. N. dot org let me just push back a little bit again on this idea that\nThat sealed too is a pollutant you know that we as human beings\nExpel that out of our bodies\nAre well you know that there is an effort from the individuals on the opposite side of your political spectrum you being Republican the Democrats are trying to regulate and their war on meat on me trying to regulate the flatulence given off by cows because that too is also CEO to\nSo if if we are saying that the coal fired plants at the ... CEO to human beings intimate C. O. two cows than in its CEO to aren't you opening up a Pandora's box to allow your political opposition who\nWho never met attacks they didn't light to tax breathing to tax ... she wants to tax anything that ... or two\nWhen scientifically speaking CEO too has not been classified as a pollutant\nActually that last bit you're just wrong but I feel too is having an impact we've known it from the Eighteen hundreds\nIt's not new science um so the chemistry of it is that you burn a lot of trees long ago and you change the chemistry of the air this explain to the University of Houston um and then the physics of lighters such light interests but older radiant heat doesn't escape back into space\nLiterally that's been known since the Eighteen hundreds so the thing is complicated is the ... you know go into that some tonight\nSure here's we're talking about you're talking about in the greenhouse effect in essence but with other than a short time that we got left that the sun or according to NASA has been a blank canvass\nFor the last for the last since the middle of the year they insure this report and because of this solar minimum has arrived two years earlier than scheduled\nA scientist or the arising that you've got um a rod ... under minimum coming out a monitor minimum which has\nAnd then you've got ... ... ... a monitor minimum coming out a monitor minimum which is a precursor to an ice age\n... there are scientific debate as to whether or not the the the amount of CEO to put up into the atmosphere which by the way what we do as human beings is dwarfed\nCompared to what Mother Nature does as far as CEO to in the atmosphere or that that this is going to throw off the hockey stick model from the BCC\nAre back in two thousand seven out of a out of the United nations that all of these assumptions you're making are based on science it's about ready to ditch proven and there's already in the process of being just proven do we want to go down that road for policy in the United states on on a theory\nNo you're wrong Chris um that that simply wrong um that's not what this shows I'm hoping it'd be wonderful if there's some sort of a stop sending ... radiation a little bit so that we could\nHave time to recover from what we've done but it's very clear from very old I Am so we're doing it it's really not rocket science which really pretty simple but we we go searching for these alternative explanations if we don't think we better solution\nBut we do have a solution because the facts were talking about would be paired with a dollar for dollar reduction in existing tax or a dividend to all of that money back to the taxpayers to see new growth of government\nSo it's art Laffer another one of ... says on our website at republic he died or got at the media to have you can see art Laffer saying it's a no brainer\nChange would attack unpack income put a tax on pollution is Dr Friedman would say and she it just makes sense\nWell known about you're absolutely right about the economics if you want less him something taxes if you want more of something subsidize it we all we know the basic economic content look I Want to get a congressman
