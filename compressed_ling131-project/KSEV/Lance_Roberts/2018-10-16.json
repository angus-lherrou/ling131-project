D. debate Cruz Senator Cruz\nVersus beta or work what do you all want to see out of the phones Jeff walk in the course they'll say or ... what's going on\nYou'll well sir\nI'm but I I Want to recruit ...\nYeah I uh there is a\nLegislative trick that Mitch McConnell and the the state is on the Republican side years and the example in the last\nOn the spending bill they included eight hundred billion dollars worth of military spending\nSo that so that conservatives couldn't vote no 'cause you know what the you know what the next a campaign slogan looks like courtesy of the state is on both sides of the political I owe if Ted Cruz voted against all the entitlement spending which is also included in there he will say oh Ted Cruz voted against our military\nThat's that's how Mitch McConnell pans in conservative by constructing a bill with Chuck tumor that that makes sure that yes our military gets funded but we have to double the price tag so we can pay for backward\nInefficient entitlement spending and that's how these ... and both parties pan in all of their all other senators and congressmen\nDoes that make sense\nOf course that interest [noise] St George budget [noise]\nNo it isn't but whenever that that legislative trick is use all the time and the left side the left side establishment uses it on their left wing ... base and uh the the Republican establishment\nAnd an effort to to pan and fiscal conservatives does the same thing to to conservative centers like a cruise so I mean you at ... I'll ask you Jeff would you would have preferred that Senator Cruz voted against a rebuilding our military that Obama decimated\nIn the country\nI Know I understand what you're saying but again he didn't get he didn't get the ability I mean if if somebody gave Ted Cruz a inability a red line throughout\nA budget proposal meaning oh I'll I'll vote for this but I'm not gonna\nInability red line through through a budget proposal meaning oh I'll I'll vote for this but I'm not going to vote for that right that's not the way it works in our in our system of government you take the whole\nBloated ball of wax unfortunately even though yes or no so you've got to look at the budget on balance and what it means what\nSo so that's how I don't like it because again what what happened Jeff when we voted for that stupid on to that we when they voted for that on the ... bill what we ended up doing is doubling the price tag of doing something we should have been doing anyway which is bud dressing and rebuilding our military that Obama decimated\nShould that's what we should have done but guess what there was a ransom the Democrats said that they they demanded you and I'm I'm Sorry that's uh\nThat's that's how it all goes\nI got one last one other thing that my observation is with my state of Texas I Am I'm independent but I I think what the Republicans\nBut at the state of textures that I'm spending billions among billions and billions of dollars in construction projects especially after Katrina with all these trades or project ...\nA expansion stuff\nWhy not of the legislation in the uh\nA police department I should say why they're not doing any efforts to a big an undocumented labor that they use in in a state of Texas is shelves [noise] er visits a joke around about Trump Building a wall but it's got to be built by Mexicans\nWell [laughter]\nThat would be a that would be refreshing actually to have gone up a illegal aliens building the wall or [laughter] I\nI actually support that I just stop illegal immigration but\nSo so what is your what is your basic question what would you what would you like to know\nHow their dollars are kind of construction going around on the rise used\nIn ... the actress period\nThere is a conception that most of it's being done by undocumented immigration and my point is that the Republicans here in Texas this will stronghold they preach and it always waving this illegal immigrants but they're not doing nothing to curb the um the labor force\nTrue you know what it it it is very true that the Republican Party establishment wants illegal immigration just as badly as left wing does for different reasons\nBut on this issue Jeff I can assure you on this issue every single Republican and every single Democrat has betrayed the American people on the illegal immigration issue betray for the better part of five decades\nThere's not been one political party that has stood up and said no more we will not sanctioned illegal activity both political parties are undermining the rule of law both political parties want illegal immigration the only person right now\nIn our government who is saying no to illegal immigration with any amount of force is president Donald Trump\n\nAnybody you know Texas Legislature got great govern over\nAll actually well no no wait a minute wait a minute now now now that's a different ball of wax\nThe governor and lieutenant governor\nHas set aside\nLocal tax payer money which is in our job to do\nBut we are we how we are paying for the national guard in the state of taxes to support\nThe border patrol or at our own experience remember this is the federal government's job it's a good job but were picked picking up the slack because Republicans and Democrats have both political parties I'm both political parties Republicans or Democrats have\nThe trade Texans on this so our local Republicans who are actually\nLay claim to actually being conservatives they are spending money to stop illegal immigration in the harm that it causes taxes\nSo now than when we we are we are doing everything humanly possible without bankrupting the state\nTo stop illegal immigration here but they come into California they come in through New Mexico they come in through Arizona and they flock right over here to taxes why because our economy is booming\nAnd and that's my point they spin and there's all this money at the border and then you know they come here for jobs why shouldn't this job sector that's hiring illegal immigrants\nWell ... and again I'll let me ask you Jeff whose job is it to stop illegal immigration do you want to pile that on to the the those who higher than the businesses I mean businesses of America shouldn't even have to check you and I agree that\nI mean if if the federal government was doing his job no business in America wouldn't even have to think about checking for for immigration status right correct now we're in the constitution does it say it's America's businesses job\nTo checks to stop illegal immigration\nCorrect it doesn't there's only a law that says you can't hire illegal aliens but with the with the black market on on labor\nWith false IDs and no Shaq or no help from the federal government as a matter of fact the federal government works to undermine our ability to stop illegal aliens from working hell they they're they're giving them vote in places like San Francisco\nThey're given the vote and places like Massachusetts in Maryland\nSo I mean look at look at all of the forces arrayed against us and now you say oh it's up to employers now since the government's not going to do its job now we're going to add more expensive to you later to you a business owners I mean business owners have enough already on their plate without having to worry about\nDoing the federal government's job wouldn't you agree\nCorrect correct so that that's my view on that now look I I think that if an employer is found to be hiring illegal aliens and they ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut it's not their job to police this it's the government's job they're the ones who are failing\n\nBank I'm afraid I appreciate that\nJeff God Bless you man thank you very much close what do you want to see tonight scene outlook Jeff and I just had a really robust debate I Want to see Ted Cruz and I you know the leftist in San Antonio media probably won't allow it\nBut I Want to see I Want to see Ted Cruz basically reveal how much of an empty suit beta or work is because he is he's one of the biggest and he's the biggest empty soup to hit American politics since\nYeah well they're not [laughter]\nI I you know one lady I Hope I Hope you're right and you know what it is up to respectfully I Will say to Ted Cruz now is the time\nYeah that was a time a because there's a lot more at stake than just your seat or your seat or in this in this in this current climate we're in is is is frankly invaluable\nAnd we we need to keep that in conservative has hey lady thank you very much for the call I appreciate it Cathy you're up next on the cell say they'll show what's going on I ...\nI just want him to do one thing I like him to describe what life under socialism and communism really is that's what I Want him to do\n[noise] well you know what his family has up close and personal experience now that rather than\nYes now and I you know you can talk about a fiscal responsibility and everything it's not going to hit people between the eyes like the truth about what people\nIndoor under socialism and communism and social and then it's just the bus they put you on it get to communism and people don't understand that you weaken the country through socialism and then communism can\nTake over yeah it's called socialism\nExactly because you tank\nYou over burden the or the capitalist system you over for the government and then they then they will lead to swoop in and say guess what the only thing that's going to save us now is communism more government the same the same prescription that got us into this mess\nBig government is going to get us out of it and and if people go there are so desperate 'cause they can't feed their families Venezuela they can't feed their families they don't have medicine they don't have diapers for their babies there are so desperate they'll believe anything and that's how left us get up and then all of a sudden they're in control of everything\nThey're in control of everything including your body yeah they well decide whether you can live or die\nThey will have to decide where you can live\nThey will decide what your career is going to be in all the people that are on welfare forget it communism socialism takes over guess what you cannot just be paid by the government you have to work or you won't carry it and they are worried if they get a random charity\nAnd even not the ... and even even that case you're not guaranteed eat now because the the the because the leaders need to eat first you know dear leaders need to eat first you know breaking continue to look out for the people so your family may have to skip a meal here and there it's look it is\nIn sick that the entire ideology is sick but that's what's being pushed by beta or Santa beating it live well you know what he might not even know it\nHe may be that clueless as to not even know it and I and I can I can believe that many of them Kathy great call thank you very much Mike you're up next what do you want to see the night from center and
