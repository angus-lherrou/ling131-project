baseball\nAnd I should have asked I I\nActually I really don't have to answer them probably know what station that was in who that person was\nBecause generally the negative person anyway\nBut I hate to each his own you're entitled to your own opinion and that's not the opinion that I have of the Astros season this year it was a great thing and it was a great ride\nThen we'll be looking forward to next year because there's plenty to look forward to with the team coming back in two thousand I think\nYou'd morning welcoming press box\nGood morning Russell I like your last statement because I agree with it a hundred percent this was a fantastic gear for the Astros sure\nI mean the last the last time a team repeated with two thousand\nNo doubt and man they are so fun to watch their full of

phone calls I really do but he did mention something that I'm not sure maybe I took it the wrong way said you know got to remember the Astros were pressing just to win the division this year and I thought\nWell yeah but that wasn't because of a a decision bad decisions at times by AJ ensure\nThat was because the A's were pushing the Astros\nAbsolutely man I'm telling you legs were kept on one and a lot of ... and the A's made it to the post season\nYes sir and I tell you another thing too there are times that you just gotta you know even in a series like this where when you can go back and looking\nAnd certainly questions some of the decisions the way that bullpen was used and things like that or the\nThe pitching rotation that's just fun to do that's part of sports I mean that's just what we do mhm um but at the bottom line is I Believe in this series\nThe Boston Red Sox are a great baseball team and now it was just there trying to win this time yeah\nI I absolutely I I Can't disagree with you it at all do you a hundred percent they they they were the best team in baseball they want a hundred and ... they didn't win a hundred and eight games by pure luck they they they they they were a consistent team all year uh they played well at home as well as on the road\nAnd you know to say you know and have the Astros collapsed late in the season and missed the postseason yeah I appreciate that would have been a disappointing year that I could get behind but fourteen to go all the way to the American league championship series after just winning the world series and losing to the best team in baseball\nYou know I Can't I Can't say that was a bad scene and it's been a great year they won a hundred games\nNone no doubt about it and now they just got it you know get the max out they get the knees up against let out do they get some rest if that neat taking care of it\nYou know what back at the end of march first started April ... part rather for sure\nAnd I trust hey have a great weekend appreciate the call to a one five five eight five seven three eight I'm switching gears do real quick week seven the NFL kicked off last night it was called colleague I I did not watch much of this game at all\nOr when I actually flipped over when the time I flipped over from coming in from football practice having dinner cleaning up uh watching some of the Astros game and then in one of the commercials are during the Astros game I flipped over with\nTwenty seconds into the uh twenty seconds ended the second quarter between the Broncos and the cardinals and the Broncos were already up twenty eight to three\nOh that was about all she wrote for me and I didn't look at it again\nUh the Broncos wound up winning forty five to ten just Rosen with a couple of picks sixes are in the game take care of them didn't have to do much at all for Denver as he was through just Twenty one passes when fourteen and Twenty one for a hundred and sixty one yards are in one touched down as the Broncos improved two three and four the cardinals\nAre right there in the mix for the number one overall pick two jobs in Nineteen they fall to one in six on the season the Texans this weekend of course they are on the road this is a big divisional match up for the Texans\nOn the road against the defending AFC South division chance the Jacksonville Jaguars\nThe jaguars are coming in as a wounded team they are reeling right now you know what I hear you hear nothing but crickets over there from Jay Lynn Ramsey no it was it's funny how it was all fun and games for jailing Ramsey when the jaguars got off to the fast start the season\nTalking trash going into my taking time to talk about the other teams receivers quarterbacks awfully quiet right now over there from Jacksonville\nBlake Bartels with outlook litter for net without having that running game which gives me\nBlake Bartels with outlook litter born it without having that running game which gives me some hope here for the Texans to go into Jacksonville and get a win\nWin for now is not going to be go he will not be going in this football game and if they can't get a running game going and they have the game on Blake morals\nAre with the Texans deeper in the way that they've been playing I liked detecting chances here the only problem is\nThe jaguars have a pretty good defense too\nAnd they're going to get after John walking I hobo Brian ... devise some sort of play it where they continue to run the ball you know in in a game like this it's okay to put the ball\nAnd flip the fields issue if you have to\nPut it on your deeper than this this is the games I think it's going to fall in the in the hands of the defense for the tech who have a chance to win and I think they can because they can bake Blake morals ... make mistakes\nAnd possibly give turn over to to give that Texans off into short field now of course the problem there is the Texans are where the second worst team in in red zone efficiency can they turn those few roles in the touchdowns\nIf they can do that they can win this football game against Jacksonville I Believe that the world has been terrible that season not touchdowns eight interceptions not to the show was that there's been any better either because he to nine touchdowns in seven picks\nAre Texans have a better I\nI I Can't even say a big news quarterbacks or Bush the receivers ... Hopkins and kick routine or as well as well for a better option there Lamar ... if he's healthy and he says he is a advantage there for the Texans off into line though for both teams are suspects and the differences are both pretty good\nIt's good to be a defensive battle I think here between\nThe Texans and the jaguars boy they're awfully quiet over there in Jacksonville [noise]\n\nTexans jaguars at noon big agency south reserve matchup willfully time obviously more after roads in the future of this fall club been a great year thank you Houston Astros for another great these [noise]\nWe'll be looking forward to two thousand Nineteen for sure [noise] that'll do visit is in the press box [noise] you're on the voice and seven hundred K.

afford an adult activity you certainly can't afford what stems from it\nIf you get my meaning\nSo this is just hypocrisy of the left in spades so what are you guys think now that you know that you're paying\nTwo million women well\nThat there is a classification of two million women in Texas alone who say they are entitled to have you pay for their intimate stuff\n[laughter] [noise]\nUh what do you say that I say uh no no cut my property taxes that's what I say cut my property taxes you want a line item to get rid of get rid of this\nNow screenings\nI guess [noise]\nI'll go back [noise]\nFirst of all said oh show I promised I'm going to break out a way\nWhat is it this is a a photo of the president of the United states and signed a Chris shell Saito thank you for being a conservative voice for Trump\nTo ... to make America great again on KFC and WBAI ... best wishes Donald J Trump one of our listeners got this for me you know the president and the rest of the you know the president did this\nHe he signs he signs pictures for Fox I had no idea no I'm not sure I'm\nNot sure how much is is that this has been with the computer it looks like it's done with a pen ... I'm I'm just not certain um they may have software that emulates that the president's\nHandwriting and they they printed out and they send it out but it is Donald Trump signature right on there\nSo uh that's what's up displayed and I was so on and didn't want to have you actually took the time to send that off on our behalf I could not displayed on the TV set yourself\nUp thanks very much a ladies and gentlemen listener Angelo\nDoing that for us do I want vibe I made by seven or eight to one five I make ... glad you waited welcome to shelter it'll show what's going on\nYour statement to make you a question that I teach you can only if\nAll right here I mean we got those poor Guatemalans herded up here\nIn which you know give 'em coca leaves them for two years and then if fish will come at it I didn't realize it was a real thing but it is already\nInfused British shores sky I Know what it is our oil rich triggers ask and put him in Guantanamo Bay you can\n... well yeah well yes he he lived a Nazi okay let's just be like he's in his his background is a is a a a a Nazi sympathizer in someone who betrayed his own Jewish heritage to the Nazis that kind of his background he's a well\nAnd who betrayed his own Jewish heritage to the Nazis that kind of his background he's a wealthy financier\nAnd he bats on he he uses his wealth to bet against democracies and then he works hard by paying extremists inside of those democracies to destabilize those democracy so he he\nFor lack of a better term sell short basically\nHe he bets against the value of society dropping and he makes a killing he did it with the u._k. and this is how he has amassed his billions is working to undermine the world's democracies and and a free people\nAny he finds political parties within those countries to help him in this case he's found the Democrat Party in the United states he needs to find anti western value\nAnti God anti freedom individuals within side of each country to help pull his financial objectives off and he has found in our nation\nAnd the Democrats\nNaturally is so many many of the rising that are that he is in violation of the Rico statute and that he should be arrested and prosecuted the fullest extent of the law I agree ... ought to be a ought to be arrested\nOut to be investigated but somehow he has paid off so many influential Democrats in so many deep staters within our own government that are just like\nThe department of justice won't investigate Hillary Clinton they want to investigate George Soros either\nSo there you go check out that's in a nutshell actually is\nWell thanks man no words get motivated to let some of it's like\nWell I um I understand your your feelings you know look up George Soros how did he make his money very instructive thank you for the call and you're up next year on the grits and said oh show what's going on\nMy car on kind of a subject I'm Talking about the ... be not sure I don't understand is one commercial that said if we don't that is going to be a huge gray optics we do though they won't be a tax increase what are your thoughts about property [noise]\nProp be as a consequence of a poorly run city in in my estimation property\nAs a consequence of of disparate pay the the the talking point goes like this police officers are paid disproportionately\nAh more than firefighters who lay their lives on the line or for the community as well in the very dangerous job and need a job that they do lifesaving job that they do show\nThe the problem is there's been such\nSuch a problem with disparate pay inside of inside a fused in their\nPension issues which still aren't resolved fully which will never be absolve bigger resolved because left wing governments don't make tough decisions they just keep on kicking the can down the road waiting for the successor to take care of it\nOr if you vote for a pay increase for any city employee\nOr any clash of city employee it is going to raise taxes\nBecause in a in a left wing government they don't cut anything they never cut anything they always say it's because they've got to keep their graft in place they've got to keep their ability for their politicians to keep on skimming off the top from the tax payers that's not going to go away\nSo what happens is they end up passing that cost on to even more exorbitant taxes to pay for their incompetence and running city government\nNow the ... if if a conservative government was running Houston they would find other areas to cut inefficiencies that graft I mentioned that the political patronage that would go away to help bring the firefighters into a more competitive pay structure\nCompared to other cities around the state of Texas\nUp many say and I'm a believer of this and the the firefighters because of the inherent job the dangers in the job that they do in the life saving job they do have earned a better pay structure\nHowever that will translate into into higher taxation because left wing or is run the government\nAnd they don't believe they don't believe in finding efficiencies in government may believe on a punishing the taxpayer to make that happen so they can keep all their goodies have their cake and eat it too so\nHow do you think you're going to vote\n[noise] uh I live in a city of Houston so I have no say in that matter but if you're good\n[noise] that's a good question um I I hadn't given it much thought how I Would approach it if I had a because I I it was it wasn't something I could get into [noise] I Am I Am not in favor of empowering\nA governments of any kind more ability to take money out of my pocket or that being said I\nDo believe I Do believe the firefighters if we want to keep good firefighters in the city of Houston you can't you can't underpaid them the way they're being underpaid and the stats that I've seen it's a pretty accurate charge\nMhm uh they\nCan't be they can pay less the free market is going to take over or they're going to move\nAnd they're going to take worse by the way you're seeing the same thing Amy in Dallas with the police officers the police officers in Dallas are so severely underpaid that city one of the largest cities in the country they can't keep staffing\nAt a proper level so they're losing cops everywhere right and what happens is ironically enough the firefighters up there are other first responders to domestic violence calls and are being changed around by dies with knives and of course that's a liberal city too\nSo they can't get their act together either and and the end it's only going to cost the taxpayers\nTook you're paying for inefficient government\nI Believe the firefighters deserve a pay raise but I also believe that people have Houston deserve a conservative government that's going to ... that's going to be good stewards with their money and you don't have it so my answer my my answer is I can see\nBoth sides but absent a responsible government aiming\nI have a hard time paying for tax increases [noise]\nHave a hard time for voting\nFor tax increases because all you're doing is rewarding [noise]\nA vanilla type Democrat left wing extremists from every Democrat in the state to take out not the folks at the top but the base of the Republican Party which is the down ballot pubs and judges the state senators and state representative when you've got when you've got ... mama\nAnd uh what's his name Eric Holder playing in a state representatives raised up in North Texas with Matt Rinaldi odd you know there's something up here\nYeah look I'm strictly voting in this election cycle [noise] um I don't think that that that the Republican Party leadership including the governor and legislators in the state party chair James Dickey would have\nSupported that are they not thought it was a good thing for the future of the state and so this is the last election cycle will see that Democrats have always voted straight ticket statewide at a higher percentage than Republicans\nOne of the messages that are going to hear from got rabbit would send a governor Patrick and others over the next whatever it is Seventeen Days is that Republicans need to go straight ticket\nOr we gotta match their street tickets strengths as much as we can uh generally we've been in a low sixties they've been in the high sixties in terms of percentages of straight ticket voting\nUm if if they do voted a higher level of straight ticket and for whatever reason Republicans voted a lower level that is going to affect down ballot races look if you look across the state Chris you've got I don't know twenty or so really consequential races you have at least three competitive congressional races one of which is in Houston withdrawn cold as soon as you know I'm\nThe sessions race in Dallas is very very competitive and in ... in San Antonio has been competitive in the past I think he's going to win a you've got you know two state Senate races that are pivotal as well as Connie burn out in the entire county and then ... and then that Don how finds in Dallas\nAnd then as you rightly pointed out you've got the road all the race and and probably nine or maybe even twelve more or state house races that could go either direction so the down about stuff matters um it's going to matter in terms of how many Republicans around the house\nHow senators we have we have the three fifths majority we need to move legislation without democratic support or you have a number of countywide racist for for foreign countywide offices in urban counties in suburban counties so there's a lot of action this election cycle and I haven't even mentioned the judges ... really important so\nUh you're right I mean the straight ticket factor is going to be one to watch 'em and that's one of the things that I was concerned about a couple of months ago is that there might be three or five or even ten percent of Republicans\nWho are thinking about voting for about two that were falling you know falling for his spell I don't think that's the case you more think Kavanaugh has radicalized a lot of Republicans because we do not want to give Democrats any power so they can even go further than they did in trying to attack this decent and good and an honest person\nYou took me right where I wanted to go because we pay them from Texas politics and how it all plays out nationally and you know this blue wave that's threatening to wipe out Texas is blue way that's threatening to wipe out America ... really been diminished in my mind at least as far as polling showing in\nJust your general feeling public perception let me go down the list here you got Cory Booker out there\nSaying that Canada does America better than Canada or any candidate America better than America\nSo conscious with her DNA debacle that blew up in her face you got the Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent standard you've got Democrats actually saying there is no presumption of innocence in America\nAnd people are ripostes even folks\nWho are moderate Democrats on their side are certainly persuadable independence how much do you believe the Democrats extremism is undermining their their blue wave\nYeah it's a great question and I think it will I look I think they'd been extreme for the last year and a half at least\nA trumped range when syndrome is now something you can diagnose um but but it really didn't didn't catch on and get traction and become sort of undeniable to the public until the Capitol hearing\nA and I don't even know if it was it was ridiculous paid or from the Democrats in the community as much as it was these protesters\nUm the rights of to peacefully protest is one of the great things about America but you know you know sending a sending poisonous material to the home of a U.S senator or publishing home addresses of US Senators or trying to break open ended the Supreme Court are all these ridiculous things thrown people out to restaurants\nUm that's not what most people believe is is fair and reasonable and writing America true and so to see the Democrats\nA break the confidentiality of Dr Ford for their own political purposes and then create these other two stories in a way to try to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh knock because they didn't like Brett Kavanaugh but because they were worried about the future of the Supreme Court roe versus Wade or to see them be willing to go to to to sink to the death\nI think really woke a lot of people a look at ... scares me it truly scares me the Democrats could have any control and every any power in January and it should scare everyone out there listening you guys ran out you've got to vote straight ticket Republican you got to help these candidates it's so crucial in so important\nI agree and we didn't even men we didn't get to a left wing violence going out and showing up to prayer marches and kicking the garbage out of conservatives Matt look

is a protesters in the nose I remember that yes during the campaign but now now are you going to tell me that that rhetoric the words\nAnd then the one punch in the nose equals\nThe the antifa thugs

are both in Chicago and I think they're a very practical\nI think you're right and speaking of Louis Farrakhan did you hear his latest Jew hating rant\nThere's different from previous ones\nWell no it's it's still the same but usually usually even Democrats would call out calling them out but no hype only Chelsea Clinton is come out and he called\nA\nHe says I'm not an anti Semite I'm anti termite\n[laughter] so ah\nCan pairing choose to insects or Chelsea Clinton had the\n... probably one of the few remaining Democrats said comparing Jews of termites as anti Semitic wrong and dangerous their response of laughter makes my skin crawl he was speaking to a a bunch of radicalized Islamic fundamentalists terrorists apparently and here's here's\n... in ... residents Obama Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton not Keith Ellison the DNC nobody is condemn his anti Semitic hatred and of course you know I'm sure Wallace would appreciate it too I mean while the strikes me as a Jew hater to\nOne on one where I'm sure you're proud of\nHim for years with him show but I don't think are sure sure community of your character\nLike we've all heard of ...\nWell I I like I said this program will welcome and the left or right anybody in the middle to have a a good salad debate but I tell\nYou the basket of biased press won't show you that will that will they they won't show you the hatred and violence in the streets will be from the left\nOr\nThe shows an open book I'll let anybody from the left or the right come on and I believe sunlight the best disinfectant\nI've always been a mind is better to be thought of a fool than to open your mouth and confirming for everybody and I am willing to provide a platform for all you left wing or is out there to open your mouth is as much as you want and can permit for everybody has Wallace was so adept at doing\nJerry appreciate the call glad you made a here to jump into show let's say you\nKnow our earlier caller yes writer or mom on my part sure\nYeah problem was critical like at a animal thirty year started after that\nAnd I just left them of course in Colorado right toward you record I offered or they said oh this is\nAlso my little one for

eat out is coming there used to call me I Know are\nIs it I'll listen to them Wallace Wallace couldn't listen to me while I wasn't interested in my point of view he didn't want to come to an understanding he just wanted to bash me he just wanted to a insult Trump\nThe the level of hatred he didn't he didn't come to the table saying hey look man we're both Americans where can we have a meeting of the mines here here's my issue what is your issue and maybe we we can come to know that that wasn't what you heard was it\nIn Wallace is just like Maxine Waters volunteers just like Hillary Clinton wants to just like rock Obama they don't give a damn about what you think\nThey don't want to hear your perspective they couldn't care less they want to force their perspective on you through the force of government\nThis is what they want to do is what ... or ... wants to do Brock Obama vanilla\nThat's what he wants to do that might give you a choice he doesn't care about dissenting voices he wants to cram down your throat his vision\nAnd that's what's at stake in my mind anyway in this election it's\nYou know and and ... some of the time it works to our disadvantage because the conservative side remembers what makes us Americans which is the ability to disagree to agree to disagree\nBut ... when all your consumed with his hate\nAnd that by all in your soul and all it ...
