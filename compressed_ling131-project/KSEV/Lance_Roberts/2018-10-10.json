zone efficiency has now slumped even further and that what what were they won for six\nOne for five and go in the Golden Globes situation ... on on Sunday gets the cowboys colleague man\nI agree with what you're talking about going into the shot young when it's so you know a foot to go and\nThey are in shock and awe the other thing is a it's a wonder if one of the Astros or maybe if they could just take walks over to visit the Astros and give him some sliding lessens your rights\nYou know that was the one of the things about the I'm going like on his name the quarterback over with Seattle is Russell Russell Wilson Wilson yeah I started to go and watch and it was a well he had a baseball bat row which is why he was so good at at the slide your or getting creamed absolutely though I mean I think\nThat would extend watching his career by at least a year just doing that\nAnd I said he's not going to last very long if you keep taking me too\nYeah I'm kind of scattered shooting right now but the other another point uh I think I've already of joked with you about this is the Steelers learned this week and what can brown do for you\nAbsolutely finally finally connected with Amy\nOh man they let it up and uh I think they're finally weeding out the uh the uh the Weiner's out of the ... I think a lot of those guys are finally just leaving and I think what's left are you going to be a lot stronger team and I think it'll it can only help improve\nI Hope so I mean the seasons obviously already awash yeah uh you know too many guys who didn't want to buy into this buy into this program a ... and like apparently did did not like got frost style which I I don't know how you can argue given his track record yeah I mean\nIt up and healthy should've just put them in touch with some UCF players and say hey talked about about frost is bland\nVery exactly and it and just lay in liquid

that a ghost rose strokes\nGreat its own way and just uh like I say I just want to kind of little mission that a ghost rose Trojan six I Hope you\nAnd it just play calling again that that force\nThat that for down and go from the half your like not even the yard line the half yard line\nAnd you're in shotgun trying to throw the ball\nI mean you've gotta be kidding me\nAnd that's why this team is is whether it's sitting right now two or three\nIf bill Brian could call the office and\nAny granted the players have to execute it\nBut again with your play calling when your coaches putting you in a situation where you're running plays and shot going on for single you're not trying to run the ball inside the tent yard line\nOr even a run past option\nWhich they can't even see that really in the red zone either\nBut when you're not even trying to punch it in from the half you outlined by running the ball whether it be a quarterback snake or sin you're you're running back over the top\nJust one or two and three and not three into a form on right now\n\nAnd really or your your your your mom saying why as you look at your game behind tendency not really to gang violence because they've already beaten you\nMay have a win against you\nKnow you get a plane again but still haven't played Jacksonville yet either\nWell listen on the schedule or you know on paper you ought to be should be buffalo\nAnd then you go to Jacksonville and then you come back with Miami\nWhich you know that could be a winnable game\nAlthough Miami is playing a lot better this year and if it hadn't been for a complete meltdown by Ryan tannahill into turnovers that were return for touchdowns by the Bengals defense in the fourth quarter\nMiami when the last game\nAnd then you get to go to Denver and play against the Broncos which you know I'm I'm sad to say that case keen them at this point has not been playing good football for the Broncos they fall and the two and three is kicking them this year through five games has thrown seven interceptions\nWhich he threw seven interceptions and Fifteen games last year\nIt's not exactly the start you want to see from case Keenan\nHopkins by the way the leading the NFL with five hundred and Ninety four receiving yards for the Houston Texans\nAnd we still have two\nUndefeated teams left\nIn the Newton, Kansas city chiefs\nAnd the Los Angeles rams\nAnd nobody is defeated this year\nAs the Arizona Cardinals picked up their first when they got off the snide\nWith their went over the weekends\nSo there won't be any old when sixteen teams this

giants didn't want him for which giants are pretty much a must win game\nAt least you would think so this week against Philly I'll be given how bad this division is maybe not Redskins who've already

know but once when you when the Democrats win then it will be okay but now go ahead do torture Sen Cruz go ahead\nThat's essentially what you're saying and that's insane and that's what we see pretty

S. E. V. a Frank thank you for waiting to the break which do you\n[noise] Hey Chris good morning I'm Hillary Clinton just actually feel I'm too pretty much the world who the Democratic party is\nThey want to take control they want to shut you down if you disagree with them they want to control your life your your freedoms and if you are stand against them they want to destroy you the perfect example if you remember there's that there's a saying and I think you might have mentioned\nMe what I Want and I'll go away\nThat is from a movie called the um storm of the century by Stephen, Stephen king storm of the century and basically that is the one thing one slogan that kept being repeated over and over and over give me what I Want and I'll go away\nIf you go back and look or have you read up on that movie you know exactly who was saying that you'll know exactly who was saying that and what they want it right they want to control\nWandered away to keep their legacy going and I guess just for a lot of people that don't know or haven't seen that movie it was a federal thing I mean what I Want and I'll go away\nWhat why tell me tell me what the fallacy of that reasoning is because as with Satan as with radicalized Islamic fundamentalists terrorists as what the Democrat Party they don't go away do they\nKnow they don't but again that's why that's the thing that phrase with them too because that is exactly what they want but yeah the fallacy of it is is that they get what they want and then they still want more\nThey never hands because they've never only some more there's always more if they take your car within my God you still have a nice house and I'll take your house if you have an eye\nOur within my God you still have a nice house and I'll take your house if you have an I shouldn't have been taken within my gosh did you have my hands or whatever it is they're always going to want to take more and more and more because they want to distribute it to their plan and that's basically how they operate\nOr they want to control or they want to control\nThat you do you they want to make sure you are thankful to them for everything you have do you owe them so that you will continue to vote for them so you can continue to support your family keep your family alive and this this this is the Democrat Party agenda\nThat has been in place for over a century now make you dependent on them for your livelihood so you can just barely scrape by and survive the summer they they they're never out of power so they can live high on the hog that if the Democrat way of doing things Frank and they want you\nTo ... and then they want you to turn on and say thank me for the little crumbs start the real little crumbs that I've\nReally directly about what a solution out what a disillusion ... at the same solution to Satan the same solution to radicalize Islamic fundamentalists terrorists the shame solution to a Democrat Party that says this\nCannot be gentle with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nThat ... started down\nThe solution in my mind ... hiring you punish them you make sure that any of it right yeah well and make sure that the solution is to make sure that they pay a price for what they're doing and right now they're not paying the price\nAnd there's one thing or is that you know I I Love what Donald Trump has done things that I Would say or do but if there's one thing one thing that I Hope that I Hope\nOther Republicans take from him is that it's okay to fight back it's okay to stand up for your beliefs because the Democrats and the media and their client never gonna like you\nAre never going to like it because I don't agree with them and I hope they at least take that one bit of things\nThat it's okay to fight back it's okay to stand up for what you believe in and it's okay but if they come and punch your nose it's okay for you to punch them back why such hard\nWell we saw that in the cabinet hearing let's hope it's catching a Frank thank you very much for the call I appreciate it Michelle you're up next on the program welcome\nI just wanted to I'm just in line with everyone thinking that we're all\nWe're all on is that you are we see from our side we say that when she said civility will return when we are back in power we see what she's saying we know what she's saying what she's saying is\nLike with every socialist with every dictator with every Communist Party when where and power it will be civil because you will not have the option to speak that\nYou will have no option you can't argue if there are two sides involved and we will be the only side\nAnd having said that I that gets people please get involved in your school boards please even children her out of school year school boards are really the bleeding beds of your society and they were going through I Know for me it's been a real battle\nBut we're going through now and the schools is I'm a kind of a two edged sword with the\nThe movement of the digital world we don't even get textbooks anymore with the movement of the tea a rules we don't even get to see our children's assignments anymore for me to see my daughter's assignment I had to make an appointment\nWith the school and we're in one of the most conservative school districts were in Montgomery icy I had to make an appointment with every single teacher during her conference time and it took me two weeks you know to find a fight with each teacher to go in and say let me see her test\nWhat material or you're covering because it's not it's not shared with us\nThere is no it is what I had been there is one that I'm Sorry I was there there is no excuse for that in the modern digital age there was no accused one of the curriculum should not be published for every single parents to see there is no excuse for unless they're hiding something\nExactly and they have to create a lesson plan so don't tell me you can't predict me of some of us that taught me these are the point you took the emphasis that says that he is the last time and again I Am and one of the most conservative school districts honestly if you look at my ... my I think we are one of the most conservative school district and it is still\nNo offense to the teachers although I Wish the teachers would fight back with us parents more\nUm we can't get to it with out the common and and it's not my intention\nKid you not Chris Chocola muffins every time because of the fact that like I Am not trying to be your adversary please don't hunting in an adversarial physician\nI wait a minute why did I think educated they've already ... they've already in his innocence cowed you because what what is known to know what what exactly are showing up with muffins and this is your right\nAs a parent I Know it the decision I'm not going to make an appointment\n... this is my right I pay taxes into your government run school you will make this material available to me right now I pay your salary I pay those teachers' salaries you will make the curriculum available to me now if you do not I guess what\nI Would look for alternatives I'm going I'm going to yank myself and my my children and I'm On I'm going to do my best to get a bunch of other children yanked out of the schools\nAnd I like to do that and we get private school for a while I Am trying home schooling but because of my mother's medical needs I hear you trying to work and they don't make it easy to do that and I'm not uncommon to most people who are\nWho are in my position so this is my painting when people go to your school board to even if you don't have kids involved [noise] you're\nRight yeah and this is where it all starts with Joe you're right\nPublish what we're teaching your kids because what is a classified\nWho think until you've been in business for yourself and on Thursday night worried about American Idol on friday making any comment I don't want to hear you say number one or two I never had a few jobs but I work for me\nAnd I'll neither does do you know I just I don't understand the mentality that they want to drive down\nThere or are in the country\nI asked him to Michael point blank how much money should we transfer from business owners to your bank account how much do you think it's fair he wouldn't answer\nJust like any you're going to ask a liberal friends on Trump to Lara Trump large complex and I asked a takeout anything to do was that during the election\nUh there's nothing wrong with the Democrats and he got down and dirty and author and ... with them and it made him and and that's what they're writing but tell me about\nAbout the law and now he had he just got done yet and it was done\nDonald Trump can be for not for him in the in the ... Republican or a few years when you ask you just ask them point like what any of these little and they all ... and they never and after watching\nNow no I ... and that's exactly why this is why beta or work is going to CNN town hall\nBecause he can't he can't afford to have the weaknesses in his arguments and the reality of what he's advocating be exposed and Ted Cruz did a masterful job of exposing that in the last debate and the first debate and beta or sell his poll numbers crash\nBecause most of the Texas go oh my gosh this guy's a socialist and and beta or work is to cook all of that in a town hall setting where CNN just to let him pontificate now for an hour could just speak for an hour and say absolutely\nNothing Michael thank you very much for the call Jay you're up next on the court said okay let's say you\nKnow I have a good story to tell about taking my daughter eighth grader ... out of public school and they just walked out some stairs sometimes catch her breath no\nGod love you I mean first of all let me let me ask you catch your breath until she patients tuning in uh we had a guest on the show yesterday they told us about the University of Texas and how it is it has been degraded to a place that by an silence sanctions violence against conservatives it's it's something to behold\nBut at least um my little girl last year seventh grade there was no math book\nYou know I didn't believe that and my daughter told me well there's a book it's in the corner you know we're we're allowed to consult and all this stuff's as the euro progressed it concerned me 'cause her rates were not looking good so shame on her\nBut I go in there and I'm told how they have online tools were twenty first century yeah ... well it turns out it pretty pissed I go to the front office start useless in four letter words\n[laughter] because because\nThe teacher could not a lot in to the online sites and this was after several weeks of telling me that they had on my tools will the teacher herself could not log in to the online tool to come to find out\nSeldom that the kids are even use it as far as I ever found out they pulled her out and moved her into\nNortheast Christian academy at least that's the old man they call it\nCovered the preparatory school now costs before new thousand dollars a year while and I still get the pay\nSchool taxes to the humble independent school district that king was so she had gone decree quid middle school and that's where these Yo Yo's\nHad online tools in lieu of a math book but that was a lie because they didn't even use the book tour the online tools\nWell ... and you know which political party runs the government run schools um it's a it's it's it's terrible and again\nEverything is being subordinate into the indoctrination campaign [noise] as a matter of fact in critical thinking is being is being driven out of the government runs schools don't question governments don't have a lot less of Republicans and don't question government otherwise\nAnd this this is why so many ... ... it is it is reaching\nRecord amounts tons of parents who had a self defense by removing their children out of government run education [noise]\nJust so they have a chance at getting made and balanced education has shouldn't be this way and our money shouldn't be using his fashion but it is they give it a call I appreciate the J you may want five eight seven three eight to eight one five I can see me back in them and [noise]\nListening to the results show on AM seven hundred K.
