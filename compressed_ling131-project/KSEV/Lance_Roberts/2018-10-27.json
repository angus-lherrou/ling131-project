do some vets to gauge didn't bring those responsible for these despicable act to just as we will spare no resources are expensive this afternoon\nI cheeses story yesterday filtered I wasn't able to get to it and then they'll give you on hold to stick with me this will be emblematic of the strife that we're feeling here do you know there's somebody that we know very well in this audience\nI went to a school called Robert easily high school and it's really just a part of society down there and you're absolutely right the whole thing began as protection of history that's what all this was it got picked up in derailed and\nThat's what happened um so for first of all there are you know zero people like that in the area um anyway\nSecond point is it leads right into that that what we're seeing with these bombs uh they're false flags I mean the timing of it\nAll of these things if you look back historically across let's just say the past three years every dramatic\nThing that's happened in politics or that had an influence on politics can be traced back or becomes inconclusive as to who exactly did it but it always leads back somehow to the left and that's all I Want to point out with this is one for the last time we actually heard about a credible attack\nFrom a right wing or that was of the scale I Can't remember one\nNo I I Can't either I mean I guess if if you want to call Timothy McVeigh a a right winger I suppose the Oklahoma City bombing and what and what what happened there but I mean I Can't make it stretch but yet she has more yeah well he was more of an anarchist\nThan a than a than a conservative and of course conservatives are primarily a fixed in here in ... to the to the constitution which was the exact opposite of anarchy but no Peter I like I said none none of this passes the smell test\nAnd it's all too conveniently politically time\nAnd it it is designed it it just seems to be a ... on the surface of political gift to one political party and that in another self is is creating tons of skepticism out there and it ought to thank you for the call buddy I appreciated gather Europe next appreciate your wedding as long as you have lady what's going on\nChris I don't want to tell the ah the the candidate that I'm volunteering for I haven't had permission to an All right I Want to tell you what I'm friends of mine that are volunteering or experienced a yesterday or this week I'm Democrat [laughter] why\nOne stat at this young lady that was on tearing\n... yeah that's you\nKnow what I'm Sorry but I notice on physical ... of a harmful you know but it is an assault\nBy herself so I should call the police you know she she didn't know what to do I know he should have\nCome and go and help her today um they another time another friend of mine that flipped off he handed uh pushing hard\nAnother time another friend of mine got flipped off he handed uh pushing hard name rented off up and you know this is the kind of demeanor that left with the Democrat Party they are they are ugly vicious\nEvil people I I don't mean I I think the people that are this way are probably the activists on and it's a strategy says we're already\nLooking at what their leaders are saying that they look at what Hillary saying there's not going to be any civility until Democrats when\nYou've got Maxine Waters out they're calling for the mobs you've got Sheila Jackson leaves office releasing the information of where to find Republicans you've got right liberal Bernie Sanders supporters shooting at Republicans this is we've been treated to all of this not antifa thug showing up on our streets\nKicking the garbage out of out of prayer marches you've got black lives matter up and up in Dallas gunning down police officer saying hey how many ... that I did I kill all white cops I mean this is a level of hate\nThat we have seen since the election of Donald Trump and its absolute idiocy\nI I Would like to encourage the volunteers and people just going to vote to understand that this is a strategy they want to incite you to come after them\nAnd intimidate\nBut yeah ... either intimidate or be able to it would make them very happy if somebody would take a swing at um yeah and this and and I know this from my son when he when young like seven eight years old there was a kid in the neighborhood that was what Edie hassle\n[laughter] around parents\nRight around kids he would do things you have to a bully and take control\nKind of like ... [laughter]\nThere you go by my son\nWho is not good and he he was a fighter and he we were holding him back telling him he can't do this or that and yeah one day he he did the wrong thing he he called me a name [laughter] my son went after him and he was little\n... but now\nWe're losing a lot of Kevin you cut out there for a minute but I'll I'll take the opportunity great story and you're right you can't you can't succumb to the taunting of these people are I Would recommend and folks we had a segment on this\nIf you're getting intimidation from left wing or is it the polling place Utah to the election judges ... and I again at either party if if it's a Democrat election judge only there which shouldn't be the case in Harris County anyway\nUh but if it's if it's that the case and they don't do anything then you call the police but you should not be spat upon you should not be harassed anywhere near the polling place anywhere within a hundred people that in France\nAnd um you know making outside of that they can be ... Democrats voted no that's okay that's free speech but if they get in your face they they impede your progress they physically touch or or harm you or try to even spinning upon you this falls that's that's an assault\nA then you call the police this type of intimidation cannot be tolerated do I want five acres seven three two one five and they can be All right well Ken because they'll say it'll show let's say you\nDon't believe one last caller fish she saw Joe flooded ... she doesn't think they made those things you can get Frederick story I'm your grocery you amaze me\nAnd I'm not very boisterous I'll just because you just for you to every day on the radio news all of us but we appreciate that I'm On multiple occasions um mentioned the great new storage you most of the folks who disagree with you but I'm I'm\nA black lives matter is responsible for killing a police officers you said multiple times am I correct\nThat is true yes or this or\nAre going to break the fact that if they don't they should be asking questions you have been killed in ... she you know what what do you have to go\nUh I I don't think it has anything is not germane to the conversation but I Would I Would\nBe good for you because you know goes on so much to the news the white man killed cops around you're doing this\nYou know there there there there is no white group out there supporting them right or they don't they don't fly under the banner of black lives matter and as soon as this individual did up in Dallas\nSo in one person who will just do all the way it used to draw this all mean shootings or you know\nAmazing that could go to the actual job a lot of good cooking so he was shocked when God have mercy write me\nLook right and like I Am I'm coming up against\nThe clock so I Want to make sure I get his innocence you hurled an insulted me let me educate you sir\nYou can yeah let let let me educate living living a educate you the looming educate you\nAre for making the ignorance tame and she just made\nThe tax breaks\nThe individual who shop those five police officers up in Dallas articulated to the police officers that he was running for white people do you understand the difference between somebody who's just a random white guy who's out there killing tops which is wrong\nWho didn't do it for necessarily racial reasons just wanted to go out and kill a cop and the difference being somebody who said that I get Whitey sounds ... the he sounds kind of angry like you write\nHe kind of sounds angry and and ... and ... just like you and the fact that you didn't know about little fact\nAbout this man articulating to police officers did I did I killed the white cops he wanted to kill white people he he's that's the definition of a hate crimes are and the fact that you don't know the difference shows your ignorance thank you for the\nCall I appreciate the way one five eight seven three two one five or they can see folks\n[noise]\nThere's the sound said all she'll actually in which we adopted from a very well known saying it's better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and confirming for everybody [noise] and right just confirmed how much of a fool he was he is and continues to be but you continue to call right I'll continue to let you left his\nShow how big idiots you are on this program thanks very much ...\nDon't forget some of the biggest races in this country are Democrats I Know them they attack me all the time\nSo that the idea that violence is nothing new doesn't say that we have to accept it and I don't think we do I don't think we should\nUh whoever sent these devices whatever they are bombs or or what some of called false flags this person ought to be caught ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nOr no doubt about it I don't care who it is whether it's a conservative whether it's a liberal whether it's a foreign entity\nAre they ought to be caught and punished and and I think they will be but\nLooked none of this was happening in a in a political vacuum I think there is one political party that is struggling to remain relevant\nAnd if the Democrat Party\nThe Democrat Party is the party of a foreigner Democrat Party is open borders anti law enforcement anti cop anti Jewish anti Christian anti white that's the Democrat Party today you heard\nThe big uh the last break from a guy named right who\nWas borderline excusing violence against whites\nAnd then calling me stupid for not for not accepting it's\nIt's dangerous where this is headed and I haven't been saying this as we have watched the left wing and their leaders like Hillary Clinton beta or Rourke feed the feed these flames of violence to their supporters\nWhere we're getting stories now voter intimidation of the polls left wing or better both a beta you're better off with a ... seriously really in America in America\nThere is one side of the political ... who was saying you no longer have a presumption of innocence in America you're guilty until proven innocent really\nIn America it's not the Republican Party my friends\nAnd it's all for hate sick it's all for hate and it isn't us Lauren Hill work I'm a Christian and said oh sure what's going on\nGood morning Chris how a just a couple of comments I'm really comment about we were founded on violence he really needs to read the history a little bit in more detail\nAnd he has a perspective I I understand it but I don't agree with it\nYeah we go back two thousand years we we progress we evolve um you cannot judge past actions by president mores try to change the things that are wrong\nAnd we have and we have to a great degree in this country the wrongs this country is the best country on the planet in my humble opinion Laura Hill and\nThe ... the fact that we have had some some black eyes throughout history in this country we have the capacity to solve those problems and unite behind our constitution our rights our liberties and our freedoms and our prosperity but not today I read it\nAnd also um the comments about the bombs has anybody address the fact that they were sent to people who do not open their own male\nRight right uh and and well the yeah yeah and and then some of them don't have postage some of them are mean meaning they they've actually been through the postal service um some of them some of them are all of them are have been diverted or with the exception of De Niro to the secret service\nYeah [noise] and and last but not least talking to right have you have argued with the child [noise]\n[noise] yes yeah it's\nThe exact same thing they try to change the subject they try to twist what you say it thinking about the boy I'm going that sounds exactly like what they tried to do when they were nine ten years old\nYeah well the only difference between right and a child is that\nChildren wouldn't wouldn't\nDare lead with oh you're an idiot or you know you're a dummy early and\nWouldn't wouldn't degrades you are when they're when they're talking to you I mean I don't know if you heard liberal Greg's call but he was much the same thing he brings up a topic when I Would sufficiently swat that down he wants to talk about something else will look at it but but he he they they don't want to stay focused they just want to be able to come on this program\nHurl their insults degrade people\nAnd that's all they offer the country right right and gray and all the left wing or is all they offer his division and hate because you didn't hear you didn't hear any of them say look Chris how can we come together and talk about this here's my perspective what's yours and how can we solve it all they want to do is just\nDo grade to grade to grade and hammer and hammer and hammer and harming harming harm and I and\nThe reason why they are allowed on this program is because they do just that you know what was the last time you heard a liberal come on the air and say that look let's let's you when I talk about what we can agree on\nThey don't ask don't debate that or they don't they both sides now don't do it name calling it it's like I said it's like it's like talking to a child child I mean I agree with you my children never\nIt's like talking to a child child and I agree with you my children never called an idiot [laughter] probably not be on the planet if yeah I'd\nLike no you um you cannot discuss with them\nYeah it's it's tough it's tough finding anybody on the\nLeft they wants to say well you know what I don't like we're we're going either how do we unite working you and I as a liberal and conservative come together to help stop is that is that that doesn't happen anymore\nI mean why would it when you've got Maxine Waters doing what she's doing Sheila Jackson leaves office doing what they're doing [noise] Hillary Clinton saying what she'd say well there'll be no peace until Democrats when really [noise]\nOkay [noise] do I want five eight five seven three I Do I

show by saying look\nWe have no idea what I'm sending these right now we don't let me somebody else does but I have no idea when get very limited information to go on\nThis could be some crazy lunatic on the far right there's going to be a ploy by the left to try to garner sympathy in a midterm election to try to manipulate votes I wouldn't put anything past the Democrats especially considering all of them and the media\nThey've already come out blaming Donald Trump Maxine Waters just come out and said he needs to accept responsibility for this or\nWhy\nShe also said that she is not scare well she said I ain't scared after being targeted by a couple of packages are self contained will look like\nPipe bombs\nShoes as we have to keep doing what we're doing in order to make this country right

different ways\nWhen he what for the first time in different ... calling on\nShe was started by a couple of these you know we keep doing what we're doing in order to make this country right she said that's what I intend to do in his young people say I am scared she called on President Trump to take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're seeing for the first time in different ways\nYes this is the very same actually wanted to plead the audio and electrical plenty I'm going to play um [noise] well you could call it a montage if you will and if you want to join us we're going to go to the rhetoric that we've been hearing from the left because they're all about peace and ... and they were about hollering in progress\nAnd they seem very tolerant and progress these days

is the new voice this year in the new voice of the different [noise]\nButcher Democrats less than two weeks before a mid term election where the Democrats aren't doing quite as well as the song it doesn't seem to be the big blue way you were looking for the fortunately no one was killed no one was injured\nBig blue way they were looking for [noise] fortunately no one was killed no one was injured none of these bombs went off\nBut\nThe interesting thing is Maxine Waters says\nTrump has to take responsibility for this kind of violence way way what\nWhat\nWas the first time we're seeing this in different ways now there's been mom sit in our country before it happened in Austin last year they killed three four people were killed in these bombs\nAnd has got bloom self up in a car\nClearly he was a more competent bomber if you will if that was the actual content of these bombs used to kill people that got killed people and he was a horrible moss who's a former military guy clearly had some issues and murder people and blew himself up when they caught him the good thing was they didn't catch him they got to him that was terrible people by the time\nGives me say that the entire\nArm of the federal government should be able to catch who's ever doing this sending these\nAre potentially expose what was the packages\nBut remember this is what we've seen for at least the last two years with this this harsh rhetoric\nThere's no stability on the ... data and keep attacking people in the streets you got black lives matter attacking cops under the Obama administration and then you get one thing after another you get older ... older when they go low will kick him\nYet now they've you've got all the Democrats blending Trump and that includes their cohorts in the media like Jeff Zucker over CNN and Sarah Sanders hadn't response and you don't mind the president's he's the only one that came out and said no this is unacceptable anytime anywhere\nTo eight one five eight ... if you want to join us to a one size five eight five seven three eight let's go to Jim listening and Katie Jim thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nMay I'm good how are you Jim\nI'm not saying it go in there\nWell you know it's it seems like seems like that it is as a possibility but at this point we don't have enough information to know exactly where they're from or who sent them but the timing and the fact that nothing went off and no one was hurt which thank God for that I'm Glad no one was hurt but the timing seems awfully suspect doesn't\nCome out you know what ... what did they get out [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell it was a gym they call it was his restaurant it's not hard to get these address as I can find them in ten minutes on line\nSo that's not difficult to do getting the information these are public figures and it is pretty easy to go find\nPeople if you really want to look that being said it boils down to as you mentioned no one was hurt none of these went off deck needs to be a really good thing or that could have been by design we don't know it's way too early but man\nTwo weeks leading into a mid term what a way to garner sympathies have you been painting Republicans and then a phobic racist massage ... horrible violent people enabled me civil until they garnered power\nOnce again I just like the you know making that up I I like common sense I'm weird like that to a one five five eight five seven or eight thanks for the call Jim to eight one five five eight K. F. C. V. let's go to John listening in Houston and Jon thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texas\nYeah yeah and I sort of flipped on Fox or just\nA way to try and kill me for his thoughts on your body but he has a program and so he ... a very quick so officers are about\n... thoughts were about twenty five in color sites look on his radio program\nAnd I'm In a car bomb line was that there was a lot of this Fisher Price [noise] mound at twenty five callers\nOn the edge bombs and what was surprising to me was it was a remarks Mary Barra yeah Brian killing me and\nTo our co host was speaking\nIn terms of it was like news to them that the caller's [noise] his truck is trust in\nThe media were looking for me and told by the media well let's go ahead\nAnd when you know and I'm thinking to myself well you know if we can't see it\nYou get different variables you know like for example um you know ... or drop bombs are there were the bomb you lead your bombers to not go through the mail\nDon't postage stamps Arnold\n... well hold on hold on you know John I think you really call there was something that I saw with postage stamp on them but it didn't look like they had been received my post offices are stamped on top of the uh the mailing stance that being said at this point we haven't seen\nAny video people dropping them off the reality is somebody dropped him off probably somewhere there is going to be video whether we see it or not remains to be seen and at one point my thought would be probably some courier somebody sent new package so\nBut nonetheless there is going to be\nThere's going to be evidence and if everybody who's going to investigate it clearly the president said he's going to use whatever available resources they have [noise] it's very early this all happened today and yesterday and really the day before\nWe get a long ways to go before we actually get the evidence and here's the other thing the media [noise]\nYou can't trust meaning you see in the media the media so therefore they're not going to believe that may first thing to have nothing but full faith and themselves to anyone five five ha it's easy to any one five five eight five seven three eight I Am ... you're listening to the voice of Texas and seven hundred case the leaders for sex radio double\n... and then I'm going to tell you there because I'm a it really the Web ale evenly it had to go any more of a sex crime all of what's going on with all of this that there is a fight between good and evil I mean I don't you feel that way\nWhen they'll tell you there's there's always a fighting going on between good and evil whether you get any worse now it's ... you're seeing it now and in many ways it is worse now but that being thank you for the call we appreciate it\nUm in in many ways you're using and now we've got twenty four hour news we get twenty four hour Internet we got stuck social media we're barrage with it and the bad news is what sticks it's the old adage if you get bad service at a restaurant you'll tell seven out of ten people if you get good service at a restaurant you until three out of ten people [noise]\nIt's weird but that's how it is so to go back now is this doesn't\nKnow we've had mad bombers the Unabomber thinking about that yeah that was to terrorize people will just do it in Austin to terrorize people these are terrorist acts at least from all accounts it looks like a terrorist act it watching the response of the Democrats Hillary Clinton having immediately having a press conference all these Democrats blaming Trump\nIt looks coordinated their answers are coordinated and this is simply reinforcing the crazy violent rhetoric they've been trying to push for the last two years to all of a sudden they're clearly that's their answers whatever the reasoning is from for whomever send these bombs we don't know yet\nBut we can look at the Democrat and see what they've been doing and what they've been saying\nThe mere fact that they called out in and Maxine Waters so the president has to take responsibility for this he condemned all violence on any ties repeatedly but the lame stream media and the fake news CNN and Jeff Zucker hate that message they don't want him to say that they want him to be a monster\nSo what happens is we seems worse ...\nWe're lucky we I mean honestly as bad as we gotta we gotta better than everywhere else we live in a pockets of amazing profitability and we'd success and economic prowess we live in a great place here in America there's still bad things but this kind of stuff like this\nIs way worse than other countries and it's ... ... we don't even want to go into how bad certain things are in other places but it does lead over we still have it\nContrary to popular belief no matter how great your society and there's always going to be bad people there's always going to be insane people\nAnd unfortunately sometimes there one in the same and they tend to get all the headlines so it seems like it's worse I don't think there's any worse I think things are better now than they used to be\nMuch in many cases what when you look at CNN or watch the news and watch all the media during the president's absolutely they're worse than their rhetoric than they've ever been in our lifetime thank you for the call to a one size five eight K. S. E. V. to eight one five five eight five seven three let's go to Arab listening in Houston hair thanks for hanging on welcome to the voice of Texans\nHey I Love the show her thank you very much appreciate

get a lot of hate for it\nAnd um what's it called it's just because ah lately I've you know I'm looking to you know everything that's going on in the world and a lot of it points to kind of crap and I don't want to be part of aside anger is\n... very much pretty strong minded because you're right it's very difficult for a lot of people believe the political affiliation and which they're born into with their families\nBut clearly you sit back and you're looking at least they're researching it and it's hard to come up with any other conclusion other than right now the Democrats their rhetoric has been very violent they haven't condemned crowds in antifa and and these other organizations in there the party of hate it's pretty clear they're walking around tearing up signs for Ted Cruz and people that disagree with\nThat not all of them are that way but there's a lot and then you got their leaders at this point in time that are simply calling for more hate no stability until we're back in charge the president's a racist or sexist ...\nBut then when you step back and look at everything for what it is our economic system is far better than it was for the last eight years before this we've got more people working all ethnicities all races all sex is we've got an economic problems that we haven't had a long time we just got upgraded as an economic powerhouse the number one in the world\nIt's hard to argue with the result so chose to me that clearly you're looking at statistics over being emotional and that's something Democrats were really have a difficult time doing\nAnd I
