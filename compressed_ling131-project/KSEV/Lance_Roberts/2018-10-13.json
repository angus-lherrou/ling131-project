understand you let me let me as you're moving let me just take up some of the airtime here and just say that yeah I there's a lot of wisdom to what you're saying\nAnd let me just take up some of the airtime here and just say that yeah I there's a lot of wisdom to what you're saying about people being formed about the generations they come up and and I don't know that\nI guess I'm gratified in one sense is that some of these these young adults see the behavior of Democrats that we that we've articulated in go I don't want any part of that\nNow there there are some that are highly impressionable that will they they don't have that foundational a grounding from home and look to these so called leaders and take their cue from those so called leaders and that's what's scary\nYeah and I I completely agree can you hear me better now yes I can\nOkay well so that's a that's a big point and I also think that you know you look at the the demographics of the United states um by age and the baby boom generation must have been because it was such a large increase in the population all once\nAnd that the influence that that generation had was proportional to sort of the size of that age group\nAnd since we've had decreasing sizes of a subsequent generations the each hole or a new generation and the views that they bring in and to to change that they bring to the country\nHas been marginal compared to that baby boom generation so when you talk about did the baby boomers have a bigger influence I think that's a definite possibility surely because of that\nNumber I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about the the the the numbers per se because right now the millennial generation is bigger\nThan the baby boom generation there there there was a more population there so it's sizes necessarily concern me it's what ideas and the culture slashed government advance in those particular generation and the idea is that we find acceptable as a culture in\nIn the Nineteen forties this idea of rolling up on your political opposition and shouting them down and driving them out of political office\nThat would have been that would have been unheard of that would have been that would have been a complete lack of decorum and now as you see that what I Would rationalize the evolution that has happened to the baby boom Generation Z\nA stewardship if you will of the country now all of a sudden you've got Democrat leaders openly calling for it\nYeah\nI don't know that's I don't know it's a good thing let me just say that\nYeah and I I I totally agree I think in today's day and age I Can't speak to necessarily the past and how we got here but I think social media entertainment you mount of time that people spend\nActually her day you know eight nine hours a day or allowing themselves to interact with that and as a result interaction leads to influence or whatever they're interacting with influencing their opinion in their behavior and I think that's part of what we're seeing right now\nSome and Peter my big my big worry is somebody going to get killed\nAll all of these folks in the basket of biased press who are sitting on the sidelines not calling out Hillary Clinton\nNot calling out Sheila Jackson leaves office not calling out Maxine Waters not calling out Eric Holder the wink and a nod from ABC NBC CBS and the local affiliates and your local affiliates and Fox\nIs that and I gotta say Fox News channel it's going to a bang up job\nI'm saying you know at least asking the question is this the right thing to do somebody's going to get killed\nAnd and one gets the sense\nThat nobody in these in those bastions that I just mentioned would care because they're unhappy there actually seem to be pulling for somebody to die so that the the country knows how\nUnhappy they are so that we will reverse course and stop all this pro Americanism stop all this great economy stop Donald Trump stop a cutting taxes and and give Democrats their power back that seems to be\nThe price that they are trying to exact Peter thank you very much for the call and it's dangerous I think it's dangerous\nAnd I just I Can't get behind it my friends I Can't I'm\nTelephone numbers to weigh one five eight five seven three two one five eight K. S. E. D. Lewis Black you waited welcome aboard Saucedo show\n\nI'm a baby boomer and out and tell you I just think let's see there's a difference in the fifties in the ... and above but I'll tell you what the perfect example of what the baby boomers there at San Francisco and Portland\nThose are the people that ran commune in Nineteen sixty and they're turning those cities and the comedy\nLook at I mean the the the the ... the conservatives being hacked to letting the police then decide that emphasis goes up oil it now they're even afraid to walk the streets or the cat whatever diseases out there\nBut durable example yeah Hi you're on a toilet\nNot only that they've got to know them into tens of thousands all over the city now now that you know\nI Know that they've got somebody what it is it you know they they hired and folks out their lowest they've hired and folks on taxpayers' dollars to clean up all the human feces they invited in with their accommodating drug\nPolicy now but it is that that you know that the hippie culture that exactly baby boomers run San Francisco can we say that's a good thing let them go thank you bye thank you very much Steve Sebelius was talking about this on Fox and friends today he's taken out an op ed decrying what the Democrats have done\nCongressman it says is they forgot what happened to you you almost feel bleeding to death at second base because of Bernie Sanders supporter Saudi had to kill all Republicans so they understand the he's the range of people just need to go sign and there are a great question could be the trigger\nWell you know you're seeing more and more of this from the left and and there's no place for them\nWhat I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it ends in citing people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about their word re country\nThat's that celebrate the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there was a way to resolve it you resolve differences at the ballot box you don't resort to violence and to see leaders hauling on violence\nThat happens in third world nations not in America\nSo again I asked the question is ABC NBC CBS Fox\nAnd the local affiliates and not so much Fox News or the Fox affiliates tolerate those kinds of stuff\nWe had a son that cabinet [laughter]\n\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nNot Hispanic [laughter] and that when he was arrested he you know he uses the name Robert when it's convenient and and then\nIf a veto thing he he throws out there if when it's when it's convenient for that as well but the media coverage that way they'll slanted is they'll say you know works\nYou know chances depend on Hispanic turnout you know it and if a Texas is finally become\nYou know a huge you know if the if the Hispanic basis finally be woken up then they'll vote for a rock and every time I see that I just hit the ceiling because it excuse me the current senator Senator Ted Cruz is Hispanic\n[laughter] if zero percent Hispanic fear right now so that is\nWhat we have run a ah right now and so so send\nOver yet don't forget in the last election the last ... election lieutenant governor and the governor of the the great state of Texas Greg Abbott and then Patrick they garnered\nFifty six percent four percent of the male Latino vote so this idea that the Latino Hispanics orange stupid the basket of biased press thinks they are\nI think they're in for a rude awakening come election day as far as this panic turn out for\nA ... a guy we called beta beta or work that he made a male he's made a male he's flashing he's he's not like Donald Trump or a fighter like Ted Cruz officers were dying talking to 'em a prime alone immediate equalizer they put up a couple of billboards here in the state of Texas I'm In Spanish as you heard\nTo to basically coal to to light the criminal record of beta or working by the way I got to remind you Brian criminality continue the FCC has filed a charges against his campaign for taking among other things [noise] foreign donations\nAre which is again once a criminal always a criminal in my mind are you guys are not only focusing on our range so you guys are focusing on other key races\nWhile we are we're also looking at Florida we're also looking at in Nevada and Arizona but I guess we started with tax because it's the one that makes us angry is I think just\nTo feed and fraud and you know the way that our work has been turned into this deity by the media the next Kennedy\nUm but we're also definitely in in Florida as well because Andrew Gillum is running for governor there he is Obama's hand picked\nA governor running on extreme left way uh you know stances\nSo we've got some really amazing to me about this election is there are a couple of dozen big races that are neck and neck that if we really stepped up our efforts as conservatives right now they're all wind up all all of them\nSo I don't know what you know I I think if we can just get people stirred up enough here I think we can get a we can have an incredible election day opportunities across the country we're now seeing races that we didn't have a prayer avoiding just a few weeks ago now with\n... or to get a little bit Kelly\nYeah because the Democrats basically shot themselves in the foot with the way they behave with Kevin I'll look I'm I'm I'm honored\nAnd gratified you chose taxes tremendous off [laughter] so that means that means you guys have a little bit of a deposition to be able to expand those similar type billboards in advertising into the other races you mentioned so eloquent what can we do as conservatives to help you guys out\nWhile ... so we are raising money or to add more billboards the factory raise that there's still time to put up more billboards if we get going right away suggest if you go to our page on Facebook at red wave America just type that yet simple and red wave America it tells you how to donate to our campaign so that we can put up\nA bunch I mean we could even be adding more taxes billboards ... came in for that if he's\nStill pointed digital so it's really fast to add them\nBeautiful Brian baloney everybody editor in chief media equalizer a long time radio host she is in

South Carolina ran over somebody\nYeah okay\nAnd what I'm seeing it on our side is letting them get away with that crap and they're not so you see Juan Williams long ago say they're well your ... your head up the Ku Klux Klan well no we don't because ...\nIs a Democrat or the organization in all fairness being there to to record of the Democrats go like minorities\nYou know it's funny because you have to lose the Ku Klux Klan was was created by Democrats and I noticed in the grass and and they are which it's funny because\nYou know I and we would they really hate when we bring that out I heard I was listening to Chris associate of this morning and I know the that he's he's friends with Juan Williams in one maybe a nice guy one if they call out on his politics or clown fish I ... them and I'll watch Greg I'm got filled just tear them to pieces and I know that's his job I guess it's\nAnd I'll watch Greg I'm got filled just tear them to pieces and I know that's his job I guess if we want to take a page out of a CNN book we can call him the the token liberal on most of the five or whatever he's on remember when he he he ventured off the reservation awhile back when he was on CNN and they fired him\nAnd then he showed up on Fox News and he takes the most ridiculous those ridiculous stands and the funny thing is when it comes to Juan Williams and once again he may be a nice guy he's a clown on television you're absolutely right he says the most ridiculous things\nWell there are classrooms or you know like CNN and they're trying to pull that they're trying to compare that to be or how many ... Tea Party rallies now I Know a lot of Tea Party people they're not radical at all what this whole members sign\nYour shoulder and now to Johnny not only are you right but you're more than like the Tea Party when they marched on Washington that clean up after themselves no one was assaulted no one was hurt no one was spat upon\nBesides the fact that they they lied about and tried to run with that in the news\nThey cleaned up and then they were targeted by the last administration Michelle Obama's husband Morocco Obama targeted them and try to shut them down via the IRS there's absolute\nZero comparison between black lives matter where at least one rally five police officers were killed in Dallas other people have been killed there's when cinder blocks dropped on people's had people who've been assaulted and there have been riots or if you want so should try to compare thank you for the call by the way Tony\nMother but just trying to compare the two is simply another underhanded tactic by those on the left there is no comparison\nThey tried to make them out to be racist they tried to make them up me monsters and the reality is once again often when you're dealing with the left is whatever they're saying the exact opposite is true they are trying to tell us that these people within antifa\nAnd black lives matter of the same there are good people in black lives matter okay\n... they're not the ones going around attack you know the people the problem is there's a lot of bad people in there too\nIn in ...
