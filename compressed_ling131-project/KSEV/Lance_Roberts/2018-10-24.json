God going to be armed they better damn well better be armed number one\nNumber two you're going to have you know how like radicalized Islamic fundamentalists terrorists have all these e moms that are sitting safe back in their little planning headquarters or they're sitting way behind and they're saying go get them go get them they're the ones sending these people that the the American military was saying you cannot come in stopped turnaround\nRight there'll be saying that you cannot tell manual happy allow the entrance to the United states\nThe people the George Soros funded the Democrat Party folks will be behind the hordes saying\nThey're not going to shoot you they're not going to shoot you they don't want the bad headlines showing that he was on the storm it and then this is what they're going to be doing well George Soros cowards are standing safe and sound the Democrat cowards are standing safe and sound way back there\nThey're going to send the shadow they're going to send all of these the illegal alien folks some of them criminals\nStorming toward the border\nUp short assured that nobody's going to try to stop them at that that is a recipe for disaster\nYou absolutely right and what that was what I was thinking when they when it said the problem is that they want to go to war and I wanted it to look out for a valley which is it\nThat driving and all that area not at all for it they're going to go like\nThey all sort of the day in and out it and what you're supposed to do is it's California\nOr Mexicali and go to Mexico valley yeah\nSo why don't they stormed that we didn't want to I don't know how we want to Texas border because we don't have to worry about it some actual area and\nThey do not come in here I think at least the first toured isn't coming or they've changed directions because they were going to arrive too soon and they were going out there that the left wing now Louis trying to knock this off the front page they don't want us talking about it because Americans are rightly distressed that Democrats and and lazy Republicans\nHave done a marvelous job of ignoring this problem and and it's coming to light that the Democrats don't want to legislate they don't want to get up there and stop or solve this problem they're only solution is to\nLet them all and I don't care how many murderers terrorists around there I don't get\nUp and that's not a solution and now every American who is\nI don't get up and that's not a solution and now every American who is watching this hoard making its way up and they're being told oh by the way if they get to the border if we don't stop them they're going to be able to get a captured and then released into America\nAnd the end for the past two or three years all the people who have been detained and caught Ninety nine point nine percent of them are still here and Americans go why who's responsible for this and I'll tell you\nLack of ... lack of courage Republicans and nearly universally every single Democrat in this country and includes the ones in the sanctuary cities and include like Houston mayor Sylvester Turner one of the biggest mayors of the one of the biggest sanctuary cities in America\nThat she was responsible and their elected Democrat leaders whose job is to sit on their apple rear end and collect a six figure paycheck a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year and do absolutely nothing to protect you or your family\nLeo welcome to science they do show legend made it\nIf you didn't do older\nYou get on the news I don't hear the [noise] like liberal getting up complaining about or because they are going to do is getting thrown to the camera or they are getting a job in the communities\nAnd are there jobs you want to go to war\nAnd also about the more\nLucky and I don't see any anybody would be weird sticking out I don't see anybody ... well no\nI didn't even about eighty percent of them by my rough estimation I see about eighty percent of them are able bodied well that men\nWell nobody you know like like back in the day that I could go with ... certain areas you know these people will be really upset you know some of them voted\nLike Ethiopia you you you don't see like Ethiopia not on a lot lately all I've got to tell you I the the the country they're coming from where the Democrat Party has won in ... in El Salvador\nThe Democrats have won in those countries and they're and they're what what are the president call them ... [laughter] that's true it's true because the Democrats have won there and that's the reason why they're ... so yeah exactly because of excessive irresponsible left wing government\nAnd an exactly what we find here in this country so that so like David Clarke was saying David Clarke was saying yeah where do all of our impoverished like Houston the impoverished black community in Houston where they were they run to to get really from Democrats where does Chicago run to to get relief from Democrats weren't as New York\nOr to San Francisco where do they run to get relief from Democrats\nYes yes and it's so cold oh that's all countries in Africa or the info country too I mean we can't even go back\nTo you know what it will and they've taken the it's not even so much left wing or is over there they're just they're just dictators\nThey're just they're just absolute a shelf saying well maybe they are Democrats self interested dictators up we'll thank you very much and thank you for making those sailing influence the way one time I made my seven three two one five I can see the votes I've got to remind you\nThat the department of homeland security has confirmed everything the president

American money and Canadian money to help finance and jump on a whole bunch of\nMoney into these failed states in Central America\nAnd\nAnd they show you know they've shown I Know that's our money they have shown no will to better their own homes so here comes the older daughter says oh we as American money all they need is Canadian money I'm Wondering how\nMuch money the Mexicans are going to pony up have they can't even they can't even pony up enough of a will to stop a caravan going through their own territory I'm a horde going through their own territory\nHow much do you trust the Mexicans actually pony up like\nYou can't trust and that's what people are on\nAll the windows are still there are you going to cut out there for a second what were you saying\nOh I was fair you know I was born on what we do our little directly I Would feel\nIf they are the people the country wants to marry your grocery\nWell not not like a ... year the what second or a member of the African American community called this morning on the course on the show\nThere's something in the African American community needs to know the black community in the United states that all of these able bodied men coming into work on that is the gift to the black community from the Democratic party and you ought to vote accordingly\nWhy didn't last many libertarians against those rhinos choice in the general election day and well that's well so\nLook I think you're going to find a lot of allies in the conservative movement again your your initiatives for property tax reform I think are supported by a large swath of of conservative\nVoters the problem is you've got to get by those who don't want any tax reform at all like judge at him and and the editorial board of the Houston Chronicle

B. and tried to get the full mosaic out there to the folks I just had a guy email me Jamy about all the crops\nThat are up there and I'm like wait a minute I I don't live in Houston uh so I I I haven't researched all the Houston ... now do you want to come up here in the sky is a particular one I can give you my opinion face value but I don't live in in and he was improper thankfully and because of that left wing government so\nUnfortunately British ... let me say this real quick yeah a a an Amish filed a suit they're not far behind to exercise or with the liberals are professors and everything\nOn the worse I think there were I think is worse\nI I I don't know but I I Know that both of them are ah ah I I really don't like him anymore my college's LSU a I had said I'm from Texas but I went the other shoe but uh so far\nThe had invaded LSU but they're invaded invaded Texas and I and in Texas a and you know and when you get the attention of our representatives I don't know all the callers we need a lot of their phones there you go that's a good good topic that you got on this morning at a certain time with our feet bass and tell them what we spent\nTime in rather thank you very much for the call J. B. C. drought next welcome to tell if they don't show\nThey've gotten to that Galveston shot I guess they're pretty a blue collar district me and my wife showed up the other day where US marine corps veteran that on you wouldn't believe the outstanding it looks that we got people looking at us like go to hell just I mean ... yeah [laughter]\nI'm John yeah everybody around or side everywhere ah we we must be the only conservative and our and our general area\nSo because you were wearing a military had the beta supporters gave you this thank God\nThey never said anything to me I was waiting for somebody to say something they didn't but they did it looks like you can just died today\nWell I you know\nThat's how the other side rules right they're loving admiration for the U.S military or for law enforcement is is nearly nonexistent\nAbsolutely yup see things for the count man I appreciate it Rick Europe national Chelsea it'll show what's going on\nMore than ... ...\nLet me let me ask you a question mark Rodney devil's advocate here are stranded in I live out in Katie and a nice neighborhood Gordon arsenals nice police force right\nWhy should I chaired the Democrats in these inner cities couponing allowing these illegals going there flubbed your school with high crime flooded schools with gangs rather schools with drugs and they just don't get the message now why should I care about that if they're destroying their own selves\nYou know that's a fantastic well I have an answer but that's a fantastic question ripped up next congressman Michael McCaul I might just hid them up with that\nUm I find it offensive having been a federal prosecutor having worked with joint terrorism task forces where the whole idea of Chris after nine eleven was for federal state local to work together and you know what ... cities does it says that you cannot work with the federal law enforcement\nWhen they have a dictator to pick up the criminal aliens so there was no coordination\nAnd then they release the criminal on the street even though ice or wants to put them in their custody that endangers\nYeah and you know and since you you you're brought up your opponent or your opponent is always welcome to come on to the court said her show and explain his anti security views on this program a congressman of Michael McCaul tens district here in the great state of Texas let's\nLet's pivot now as as I mentioned we have a second horn forming and this is what's going to happen wave after wave after wave if we don't stop them they will continue to come in and this is exactly the Democrat Party wants a ... a less secure America pandemonium or we understand that\nNow let's now they have changed course they're not coming to Texas anymore they're not coming to New Mexico anymore this the first toward they're going to California because they are delaying their arrival do you believe this decision by the I Believe left wing elements running this whole show this was a conscious decision because it's taking up all of the focus in his mid term election\nWell there's no question the start of the Caribbean down there it's the opposition\nGroups in Honduras um that are left wing I'm In no doubt they know are left leaning politicians the United states and we know for a fact that's who started these curious as to what's leading opposition groups in Honduras um you know and if I were them\nI'd probably say California too when you\nSay Oh yes I see where he said there there were a riot yeah there were a rival would be too soon and they're noticing that this is playing right into as you mentioned the Republicans hands who are pro security in the Democrats who don't want to talk about anything resembling illegal immigration and their advocacy for it\nSo they got to delay it they're going to put now they're going to arrive in California well beyond the election and that coincidence\nYeah and you know that's why they drag it out as long as it's in the shorter distance is to go to Rio Grande valley sector yep yep frankly sex and I'm I'm Glad they're headed\nTowards you know for me too but but again they're also going to meet a wall of resistance from us because unlike the other states we actually believe in protecting our citizens last question I have for you\nIf when if slash when they make it to the border uh and it's looking like when what legal remedies do we have for deployment of the U.S military to stop them\nSo this gets complicated the military as some called policy come and taught us was asked to in the last the nineteenth century it prohibits or military from\nEspecially at like our military and in in the United states and domestic territory um [noise] so they they have a limited role they can provide support logistics other two titles I'm not suggesting for weeks on this but I think they usually operate in her trial thirty to guard as if they're operating a title and\nThey will anyway and it talked about on marketing called show last night on Fox News ... was the I ... I was it was really I'm very adamant about this as we we've got to have a um a an action or between Mexico in the United states\nAnd it's a coordinated effort between the two countries\nInside and Mexico to stop the Caribbean before they ever set foot on American soil because once they get Chris talked about this law we tried to change right every Democrat voted against that once they said that they have all these protections\nIn rights yeah which is some but I mean let me ask you let me ask you about the the part of the border then is between\nCountries which is no man's land or a no go on a\nA militarized zone for lack of a better term could our military operate their number one include our military operate on Mexican soil with the knowledge that the Mexican military has had several incursions onto our soil that we have not responded to\nA as a matter of fact even firing at our border patrol the Mexican military has could we push that if she were the Mexicans and make and operate on Mexican soil\nYou know we work with their intelligence we work with their law enforcement it's if if the searchers date for this hard enough for president I don't see any reason why we can have a coordinated military effort to stop a these are you know this ... come them before they ever touch foot on American soil that\nThat ... really are the ultimate goal you're the other thing you can do that for a good and right and at one point in history was closed reports of points where the injury the poor down a tree that's that's another option\nThat's gonna hurt Mexico a lot more than it's going to hurt us that's for sure congressman Michael McCaul everybody temp district here in the grace in Texas always appreciate the time dumping a stranger to the next time we talk\nOn that you so much Chris\nYou measure to weigh one five I make seven three two one five I can see your reaction to what you heard coming up next on the voice\n\n\n\nPoison ...\nShould know Mr antenna these guys come to your house for a one time cause and set up an outdoor antenna that gets up to fifty plus digital channels bless you get all the major local channels like ABC NBC CBS Fox bbs and more adopt a monthly payments\nCalled Mr antenna at age three to six seven for twelve twelve and a three to six seven for twelve twelve or vivid miss her antenna dot com\nAre you concerned about the volatility in the market attend the upcoming money matters seminar to learn how you can protect your retirement savings\nAttend the upcoming money matters seminar to learn how you can protect your retirement savings\nPlease visit money matters dot net to register for a seminar or call us at eight hundred nine nine for all three oh two eight hundred nine nine for all three oh two\nNext seminars or on Saturday on top of the twenty seventh at the courtyard by Mary I use the ... lake and Wednesday November the third at the Hilton garden in sugar land\nI started to campaign and then I Would not be ashamed to start with the whole that whole fact that you have to say no thank you I have I didn't end up paying money for you that Congress that that you think [noise]\nMy opponent Sheila Jackson Lee let mine from our path country and winning teacher my home to the American media district with four people living in finding that neither the aim of paint us common Diane\nLane than I Am and the pain and I approved\nThis message politically I think for my congressman\nRoads are fake game one of the world series with the Los Angeles Dodgers within a horror when game to\nDeny from way bar they would probably be on the mound for the red Sox where you'll be on the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the rockets or by accident I deliver to improve on their lowly wanting to start again the Utah Jazz sitcoms just after seven o'clock I'm more than\nI Am seven hundred K. S. E. me the voice of Texas now back to the south places [noise]\nLooking back I got a reaction from our conversation [noise] far from some\nMany that myriad topics we have brought up today now's the time to weigh one five I think by seven three eight to eight one five I can see the mat appreciate your waiting to the interview what say you\nThat you want to ... sir\nHey I Am always and are completely against illegal immigration um but and I do think this caravan as a Democrat ploy but if those folks don't make to our border by election time what do you think's going to be their fate when they're no longer needed by the Democrat Party\nAll they're they're still going to be a confrontation or because ... regardless of how the election goes\nOr there will be a confrontation because the Democrats want to\nPortray it as a mobile wrongly say the caravan is made up of women and children and uh whatever action as a president takes to stop them or they will ... ABC NBC CBS CNN will distort reality to make it look as if Donald Trump or some sort of mean individual problem is\nI think if this if this plays out the way I think it's going to it's going to backfire on the Democrats and the Democrats marketing arming the eight in the national biased press so I bet that was going to happen\nYou know what I said so unpopular they're going to turn the lights off and just leave these people out in the desert but we'll see how it shakes out\nWell we'll see we shall see a lot of folks out in California are banking on those illegal aliens to come in and bolster their voting rolls so just know that David you're up next on the ground cells they don't show would say you\nA good morning to you here are certainly people would go Republican forties early\nMorning\nShow toured the hand wringing that there's nothing we can do to cry\nAnd ship it or ... or ... of the world look we've already stood a whole bunch of money on show means of control encouraged [noise] limber warn somebody figured out of a mob that's organized at all we have to be able to stand up so we have something called it was two banana peel", "show_name": "Lance Roberts", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "24"}
