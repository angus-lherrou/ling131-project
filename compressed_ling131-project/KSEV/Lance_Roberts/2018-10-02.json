hundred pages we beat you to hop over to the Facebook page [noise]\nLike if you haven't already great news for you\n[noise]\nContinuing on with our recap the week and that was in college football I Do have to say that\nAnd what was the great game\nBetween Penn State and Ohio state's before the second straight year ... they\nJust choked\nThere is no other way to put it\nAbsolutely jokes\nEven though ... sorely didn't exactly\nA great game and the guard to the passing game for Penn State he didn't throw interceptions\nBut completely just sixteen of is thirty two passes\nFor fifty percent completion percentage and two hundred eighty six yards\nI honestly I I still am shaking my head what I think about this game what was head coach James Franklin thinking on that for ... play call\nThat was the absolute worst play call I think I've ever seen\nAnd I've seen some pretty bad ones\nOn the buckeyes forty three all it all you need is a field goal you just gotta get yourself down in a field goal range\nAnd you have plenty of time to get there\nBecause the Ohio State left ear over two minutes on the clock\nAnd force in five you need five yards to move the sticks\nAnd you call it almost delayed like hand off\nThat Rand right into the team the Ohio State buckeyes defense almost as if\nThey knew\nThat play was coming\nAnd completely stuff that play to secure the Buckeye win over the ... the alliance\nI when I when I looked at the top the top twenty by breaking the fact that Penn State only dropped two spots I was disappointed that\nI don't think they should have been to drop further that you ... you blow up a a twelve point fourth quarter lead\nAt home and not get it you're playing a ... you know top top five opponents\nThat was shocking to me the daily dropped two spots\nThat was shocking to me that the only dropped two spots\nI Would take of the home\nYeah I'd I'd give I'd give up those points to it in there you go you\nYeah my wife may ... bet Judy where you teach fast I told her getting started eleven o'clock she says what yeah so I said yeah yeah they were certainly has hurt but I get older as what happened in your wall to wall makeup hair so what's your last night at malls\nYeah brilliance well brilliant but I ... when\nThey when they when they needed him maybe you know to to touch down drives in the fourth quarter to to do to pull that out for him for Kansas City\nYeah and and just one test out fast and guess what I got the highest paid player ever far because at one time\nUntil my mom Miller one year me yeah on tackle\n\nOne man I went and rented that gangs loss there were several ... bought their office the last thing I you know I haven't seen\nMuch education is year just on the little six seven minutes they preach gay or watching the first\nHalf last night that office why did you get a prayer of the kids get settled in factor four or five seconds if\nYou have four sacks shoes you got twelve yes it's usually three to one ... a section called fat kids fat in the homes\nOn top and here's the deal them don't have a pocket and let him run out\nHe's rather ... and ain't got look to run he looks to run out and walk into that field\nYeah he does and he's got a great ... a a pocket presents an awareness of the football field and always keeping his eyes down the field a\nYoung one on one of his uh one of the play dress on making where he was scrambling to improve through it it was a touchdown than he threw that where he was almost right up on the line of scrimmage and and just got to throw away\nBefore he crossed the line I mean he is he's been phenomenal everything is advertise this year is the former you force ... first round draft pick\nOf the Kansas City chiefs and you know maybe we are a lot of question marks about him coming into the than if he was going to be able to do it handled the load in you know so far so good there for ... last night three hundred four yard touchdown no interceptions for ... homes or he's off to an incredible starts to his career there's no doubt about that\nYeah and uh\nYeah\nThat's actually what I tell you earlier I've been telling me for years they needed a slot machine right mhm and I guess first game recording did I just don't understand cats it gets a little bit of guys out of ... like for three or four for\nQuite a few ... and and look at a museum and especially when you have a quarterback can extend place you've got that cash that facts\nOut there in the past patterns he said that for so you get your best bet is it not try to get to him in the pocket that that makes sense yeah because it's outside that pocket twice as deadly as his inside the park\nHere this is why you gotta you gotta contained him and keep them inside the pockets\nYeah and they didn't have a a guy with the caller said when they got a guy covered in\nA Washington quarterback spy versus spy on him when he swore that touchdown mhm they're wanting to spy on him spiral that guy he can run\nYeah you come out when they're down there and the goal line when he ran in ...\nYeah yeah look as if you look at the Texas district ... you know what happened to watch the second half that'll locked in almost all of that second half\nOf what was the bus package for some kind of package you get somebody else or the quarterback because that was the idea that we use in a lot of times doubled walking ... you'd have to cook\nI ... I mean if\nYou don't have this in your system if you got one guy calls in all the time they're also chip is found it was taken at\nCornell you've got the favorite quarterback it you've got a guy taking walkers I just don't understand ISIS\nSochi sucked in and you're right that Penn State why why is it when you have two to three to five dollars and you can you change that just all the time they don't want to be the boss sideways\nNow I Know that that drives me absolutely crazy when you need a four to five or thirty five and you're going to mobile screen to yards to yards beyond you know behind the stakes are ... you know you got to throw the ball to the stakes are past the snakes\nYou know it's it's it's yeah I'll never understand then that frustrates the you know one out of me when I see my team be bad\nAnd you know what finally is happening finally somebody I saw one game\nI only I only somebody I was watching the first or sometime after walkers out there right\nSo what I saw on the games on my bike in the water is going to build a couple of times\nThey're doing that with that\nBut other than that that screen it just makes more than\nIt does and listen to him calling that call through and that ... they ... they gave him a project called I was ... I I James Franklin will that that play call will haunt him\nThe rest of the the ... I can promise you that\nThat will haunt him the rest of the season on top of that besides blowing a twelve point fourth quarter lead with [noise] what about eight minutes to go left from the game that to wait fifth there and watch how they play for the victims shaped your game in Indianapolis\n[noise] and we'll be sitting there wondering what if\nIf I call something different because all they needed was a field goal in fourth and far while you're running a head off [noise] I have no idea no idea and and and that was that that was all for two time out to time outfit recalled prior to that place [noise]\nSome believable [noise] sometimes coaches just out think themselves [noise]\nHey that'll do it if it isn't the press box national\nLeague wildcard game tonight between the cubs and the rocky [noise] on ESPN you're on the voice have seven hundred K.

then if attitude change if they go through so many decades and it ends up being detrimental devote country than they can revisit\nBut the the solution is never to impose in a free society and pose the

abortion the killing of a child in utero is a substitute\nLess invasive more effective frankly when I shouldn't say more effective up less invasive and more widely available contraception so that's

STV here is why I Love my president\nOr calling out the Democrats on their ... and then also you know throwing them all\nA little ... toward the media is well\nThe interesting thing is nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career 'cause\nYeah he's talking about capital now everybody wants to talk about what he was doing in high school\nBut twenty five thirty years I'm a professional career than the Democrats and in the basket of biased friends from all too willing to flush down the toilet this is President Trump at this press conference talking about the trade deal which we're going to talk about next\nTo the New America Mexico Canada trade deals\nI there were no bad reports I mean there are bad reports on everybody in here most of the people sitting down there ... except for my ... [laughter]\nWe find one on him and um I think that's going to be that'll be the greatest shocked [laughter]\nYou know there are bad report showing everybody I'm looking at people\nI'm sort of look at some of these people asking the questions fucking\nPolitically Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I Want to be on the snow for sixteen years you said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call him die angle Richard stunning that's his ... he never went to Vietnam\nCan you guys picture Jeb Bush\n... telling the truth like this that senator Blumenthal lied about his service in Vietnam can can you see Jeb Bush doing this you know can you see George W. Bush doing this no\nThese Democrats get to do all manner of malfeasance and illegality and downright low behavior and never get called out by Republicans in the name of in the name of being a statesman in the name but the Democrats never return the favor\nThe Democrats do this to Republicans all the time and Republicans never return fire while this Republican does\nAnd he's up there saying we need honesty and we need them check with this guy lives when he was the attorney general's Connecticut deed allied [noise]\nI don't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race and you want anyway because Democrats are always win in Connecticut He wanted very close probably the closest ever but he is he got ... and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you know what take a look at his record and when he got out\nAnd we apologize she was crying the tears were all over the place and now we act like how do you take a look\nThe judge who has led an exemplary life yeah\n... ... let's compare and contrast\nSenator Richard Blumenthal with\nWith Kavanaugh\nOr the the the character of the two men doesn't even doesn't even come close Kevin ... is a much more upstanding a better American that senator Blumenthal better human being than senator Blumenthal\n[noise] I mean you go back to high school\nBecause he had beer I tend to judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with me or take a look at Cory Booker he ran Newark New Jersey into the ground oh by\nThe way we're gonna we're gonna change his name on your recommendation folks to Corey Grover\n[laughter] you guys know about the sexual misconduct allegations against the senator from New Jersey by the way running for\nPresident he was a horrible mayor and he made statements that when he was in high school or college while he was doing he actually made the same thing and now he's talking about\nUnderstood understood of Dr Michael butler opinion soldiers are gas right now he's a public policy analyst economics expert and a professor of finance Stockton University in New Jersey let me put it back because you you briefly touched on this this new trade deal\nWhat type of influence or pressure will it bring to bear on the eve you to fulfill its already verbal obligations to reform their trade deals with us\nAnd then you also mentioned China how much of these new trade deals bring a lot of pressure and and make an isolate China really and bring them to the bargaining table\nYeah now remember President Trump is not a politician she's a business person\nA politician sees a problem and international a problem they ... politician would convene a summit er we come back six months later and talk about it and then we talk to Congress come back again next year you know eventually kicked the can down the road\nWhat President Trump is not a politician who's a business person a business person sees a problem especially if it affects your bottom line and confront the problem immediately though Trump's saw these lopsided trade agreements with the European Union China and virtually\nEverybody else and he says to our trading partners let's come and renegotiate best\nWell uh they said they were no hurry to do that because everything is in their favor right again what a business person would do is create a sense of urgency though what President Trump did was slapped on these terrorists that created that sense of urgency brought in Mexico brought Canada\nAnd the European Union has come in and said we're going to try to work toward a no tariffs\nPolicy um the big um after signing this NAFTA it puts pressure even more pressure on China to come to the bargaining table the\nReality is that China needs us much more than we need them they have all the steel production for instance that up we stop by and they're still they're going to have a problem so we can make our own still be a little more expensive but\nWhat we can make it so what this NAFTA agreement does is add another a sense of urgency to a Chinese\nI Believe that China will be at the bargaining table to negotiate something before the end of the year well in math is help helping that\nYeah from your lips to God's Ears Dr Michael ... everybody PHD public policy analyst closer and economics expert appreciate the time and expertise or in the course they'll say they'll show\nThank you criticize it was my pleasure\nYou mentioned coming up national scheduled to appear is Donald Trump junior on the show to wait for that coming up next and then get your questions right at\nThe top of ... our our Senator Ted Cruz will be in for heads off hedge all three of them resolve it'll show you get to ask questions of your senator and we'll get that under way again topple next hour on the subject\n\nOf a number of them look who calls on my telephone the one the only cabinet maker maker mortgage what's happening lady\nGood morning crash you know you've all heard the term follow the money today I Want to remind you to watch your money in other words carefully and explore all of your options before you take everything from the sale of your home and put down on the new one if\nYou can put twenty percent down very comfortably and still have plenty of savings in the bank I'm Talking like at least a year's worth of living expenses then it's fine to do that but what I see white too often is people who savings and almost all of their network is tied up in their homes\nAnd they may in real trouble if an emergency comes along that's just not way to live at all I said the most important thing about your mortgage is that it's comfortable for yet no matter what and that includes not dumping\nSeventy percent or more of your savings into at home now number one it's not going to say it that much money on not play payment and number two the later not\nSometimes the rates are better on a Ninety percent loan than on an eighty percent loan how 'bout that grass\nWell would you explain that because I I it so you ... rage is it in the comfort what are you looking at when when you're making these decisions\nThe I'm always saying look at the whole picture\nAnd people will be tending to take almost all their money and put it down because they're afraid of private mortgage insurance or they are they are thinking that it's got citing bunch of money on their down payment for our monthly payment\nAnd the thing is here's a clue okay if you're going from one house to another and you can't comfortably put down five percent without getting into the equity of your current home\nThen you need to look before you put all that savings and because of the other side like I said what surprises staple one of the things that's considered and in determining rates on mortgages\nIs the loan to value and and let's face it lenders are based on grade they like to lend money and therefore sometimes you will find a rate is actually better on a Ninety percent loan than it is\nSometimes you will find their rate is actually better on a Ninety percent loan than it is eighty percent so look at the whole picture before you stretch to put twenty percent down on a home because it may not be doing that much good\nYeah I understand so those were more information where can they go out\nI find me at too late one three one three six six eight three which is also three one train and I wanted to say one other quick thing if I could crash sure thanks personally that Desmond and\nThose who do something about what's going on because sitting back and

I'm ... and you know it it is something that we see on the extreme left the states\nI'm ... and you know it it is something that we see on the extreme left that said that they think kids they think little girls are fair game or the little girl they went after is is that ten year old girl that that that they're so sanctimonious and self righteous that they think they're justified\nIn mocking a little girl and and you're right during the presidential campaign an editorial cartoonist for the Washington Post\nDrew a cartoon of of me with my two little girls making fun of them and portraying them as as dancing monkeys and that and it was repulsive when they did it there and it's repulsive when they did it did it now you know it was it was not fun to sit down with my daughters is I have to do cancer and our youngest was five at the time and I had to explain to her\nThat there was a cartoon and a newspaper that that that that turned into a monkey them than it was me but it was going to be okay to I mean that would not upon conversation I'm certain that judge cabin on his wife have had a conversation with their daughter that was equally a horrible\nAnd and in particular that the cartoonist would focus on that moment it it was one of the most poignant moments of judge Kavanaugh's testimony where he describes how they're ten year old daughter in the midst of all of this brutality this me or just in the midst of all of this ugliness\nThat their daughter had prayed for Dr Ford crate for her family and and that that that's a level of of the sweetness um the ... that was a bright moment and what was otherwise a a a very very ugly guy and and for the cartoonist to to go after the child is just wrong\nWho are conservatives those of us some just believe in common decency a to respond not uncommon we we should not respond in time with that same hatred with that same anger but instead respond with love ... respond\nAt ... and now I'm not saying ... don't fight for what we believe in but we should be happy warriors we shouldn't joy for what we're saying our job is tell the truth we understand that if you cut taxes and cut regulations and get Washington off the backs of small businesses\nThat result is what we're seeing now for a million new jobs wages go up more opportunity the result is Texas is booming and\nSo we should respond with a smile with a cheerful spirit and as happy warriors I think that's how we help bring the country back together which is something I very much hope we can do\nYeah we've packed the hostility here because uh you and and the president you guys botched out of that typical Republican model of Democrats getting to say and do whatever they want and Republicans roll over and take it out there apoplectic that we have a president doesn't do that also\nThey lost the ability to tell us what to do when they lost the election and there's nothing worse for a liberal than that hot Don welcome to say don't show your questions from senators are\nWell it's a red letter day I get to be on one Senator Cruz um you know if you if you Republicans really want to blow the whole thing and out of the water why are you not pointing out that this new sports father and grandfather were both CIA and then at Stanford she recruited undergrad showed the CIA I mean that the blow this whole thing right out of the water while you're not doing that\nGet what what about that senator I'm we we've heard several reports documenting that about the the involvement with some sort of tangential involvement with the CIA from its foreign has that been investigated it all\nYou know I I don't know the underlying facts behind that if if that's accurate or not or what I can say is is I think my approach and the approach of the committee or was that we didn't want to put Dr Ford on trial um we very consciously did not want to see sometimes\nIn cases like this where you have an allegation of this nature or ... you you see sometimes the alleged victim becoming\nA subject of a of a whole series of character attacks and we made made the judgment on it the right judgment that that that was not what the committee was going to do that we were going to give her a respectful a opportunity to to tell her story without a ... with out\nOr anyone attacking her and and nobody did that was that was a very conscious decision now that's not to say that we simply take the allegation and treat whatever the allegation is that it must be true regardless of the fact we have an obligation to assess the facts and so where where I have my focus was was All right\nWhen you have conflicting evidence you have testimony the testimony of Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh was directly contrary\nHow do you assess that like the essence and typically in a court of law the way you would do that is you would look to what what is the corroborating evidence what does the other evidence that indicates which of these these narratives is is more\nAnd and in this instance Dr ... three step back witnesses she said were there a ... at this party well all three of those facts witnesses have given testimony to the committee they'd given testimony under penalty of perjury means if they live they could face up to five years in prison\nAll three of the fact witnesses identified by Dr for explicitly refused the allegations she gets\nBye bye doctor for explicitly refused the allegation she gives a most most significantly is one of those three as a woman named ... who who Dr Ford says was at the party and and who is a lifelong friend about triple\nA and and miss Kaiser says\nShe doesn't know jak judge Kavanaugh she doesn't recall ever being at a party with judge Kavanaugh already party like the one after four describes now that witness in particular I think should be given real weight because she has no incentive to live whatsoever could know judge capital and she had every incentive\nTo backup or friend store and and the fact that she ... under penalty of perjury sense it could not do so and and and disputed the town\nI'm I I think I think is is powerful evidence and so in looking into the corroborating evidence that's what led me to vote on friday to confirmed judge Kavanaugh is that the corroborating evidence\nAll refuted the allegations that were raised I think that's the right approach rat rather than um anyone going down the road of of this merging doctor for it I think the people the searching doctor for\nOur Senator Feinstein and the Democrats who dragged her into the public arena against her wishes and violated her requests for confidentiality ... and she's been mistreated enough by Senate Democrats and and and and it would not help matters for Senate Republicans to to to be doing so as well\nAll right let's go to Roberto next Roberto welcome to of course on the show appreciate your patience you're on with Senator Ted Cruz\nI ... I'm a big fan thank you a ... it's an honor to speak to you\nOr I just wanted to say I'm my name is Roberta I'm I'm I'm a doctor in here and I doubt in fact with Dr Roberta Morocco and it's a disgusting how a lot with a war causing so they'll bend those reserves or ...\nAs long as I say that it's shameful cultural appropriation that he does\nBut uh I encourage ... banks will protect crews um I'm not going to use what will you be doing as far as a free market medicine insects is what kind of a policy to be promoting to to open up medicine or the free market\nA well prevent those type type type you for calling and thank you thank you for your kind words ... ... it's a great question um if you if you look at medicine\nOr we're seeing the consequences of Obamacare which has been more and more government control of Madison it's had an enormous consequences for patients\nUh most significantly it's cause health insurance premiums skyrocket which means that that that that more and more tax and can't afford health insurance because the average families premiums have risen over five thousand dollars a year\nIt also is making it much harder for medical professionals like yourself\nTo to to practice medicine the vet but the rules and restrictions on the bottom of care consuming more and more time with paperwork more and more time with government supervision and less and less time doing what you signed up to do what you love which is actually caring for patients providing care for patients I hear that from doctors and nurses across the state\nUh that that they have far less ability to to to actually practice medicine and provide the care that patients need\nYour question was what am I doing to provide more freedom I as you know\nI have led the fight from day one from the minute I arrived in the Senate I've led the fight to repeal Obamacare I think it has proven to be an absolute disaster and as her millions of tax um\nLast year we spent thousands of our ... I personally spent thousands of hours working to bring Republicans together to have to repeal Obamacare we Cain\nMatt namely one vote short you'll recall last summer we we we fell just short with forty nine votes to repeal Obamacare but not fifty as as three of my colleagues voted no into the whole thing down\nA that was frustrating imagining beyond words\nA ... and and I think it it remains the greatest unfinished commitment of the Republican majority now that being said we've got a partial victory several months later in December as part of the tax stuff\nWe repeal Obamacare individual man\nI led the fight to do that nobody thought we could get it done given the fight it had earlier that summer most of my colleagues said that this is impossible we don't have the votes while I worked night and day to bring Republicans together we got all that easy to Republicans on the same page and repeal the individual mandate now we need to finish the job\nAnd repeal the rest of Obamacare to do that\nWe need to grow our majority in the Senate there was a total of ... Democrats running in red states that Donald Trump carried\nWe grow our majority from fifty one and if we can get their next year with fifty three fifty four fifty five\nThat is much more of a working majority and I I Am committed to continuing to work to get the job done and and I think\nYou know the patient should be able to choose your health insurance and you should be able to choose your doctor shouldn't be Washington making those decisions it should be used a patient working with your doctor to make\nChoices about what health insurance and what health care is best for you and and the way to lower prices is more choices more competition more options more consumer freedom and that's what I Will continue to fight\nAll right center I wanted to do a moderators prerogative here and take
