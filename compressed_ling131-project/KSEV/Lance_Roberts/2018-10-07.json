created in his image I'll\nBe at a shattered remnants of it and God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are\nThere must be something to each life steady grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not and as Christians\nWe cannot be complacent about

lives have purpose we may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies\nBut there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is you'd see God is a servant

him\nTo see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the facts to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him\nAll lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserve to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist\nAs lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we need to may love and in doing so may receive loved and return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger

which God which for you to have\nTaken a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I\nEncourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil wants you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save that center the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nA mixed darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age\nAnd in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior ceased to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also\nI mean we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be hurt me hold children our heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMay we thank the

grocery store accidentally she was with her mother they walked in the door mark judge is moving from shopping carts and he acted a plot\nThat he thought that almost like he saw go\nAnd he acted supply that he saw that almost like you saw goats and sheep that high bar\nAnd the prosecutor did not thoughts on that but they said that the million dollar question will let me get a strike\nYou were you were you were involved before this guy you're claiming witness and did not help you and your moment of terror when you're undergoing such a traumatic event and it just the vents that you say the practice for the last four decades\nAnd rather than have an uncontrolled emotional response to this person that was complicit in this off all of that all you could say Hi mark it doesn't make sense\nWell yeah and and and again the way she described it in her testimony was Highmark as they are ... ... it was very a\nSon who's very flowery and she had a ... yeah she had a voice like that anyway that\nIndicated that a very uh\n... voice even though she she does appear to be\nA a a older and what what surprised me was let me get this straight his laugh and his abandoning\nYou as you were being sexually assaulted hunch has haunted you forever you can't get the the laugh out of your brain but six weeks after this alleged traumatic event you bump into him in your first instinct is to say\nHi yes I that didn't make any sense to me either\nOkay now I don't think there was you know from what she testified you remember now we don't know the day we don't know at times we don't know a place right I don't even think\nEven if they report and the fact that she reports the same detail back them or lack of detail that is probably not enough that even\nA ring a criminal charge is probably not enough evidence at that point you bring a criminal charge here's this was a little the civil war is going to sound a little crazy for this\nUh but if you do your own research I found some stuff on the Internet last night that there might be a deep say elements to her involved\nFirst of all you look at her lawyer the male lawyer with the beard and the glasses on the right or is Michael Braun which lawyer friend in the face\nWow that's right that's right but the lawyer on the left that were cast as a Clinton or\nWell wait a minute it's so if if Sheila Jackson Lee was pictured slipping what we think is a pay off\nA to\nAndy McCain's lawyer I mean this could in snare Sheila Jackson Lee not only in this Kavanaugh debacle\n... where the arising gym that because all we need is a theory and all we need is you accuse because ... and the Democrats America just the accusation\nIsn't enough um to\nTo tone FBI investigation we're theorize humans we've heard today that it could be Iran's giving Sheila Jackson Lee money to uh to undermine our judicial process or could be Russia or China we're not sure which but it doesn't matter we need a full FBI investigation before the election of of Sheila Jackson Lee in what was in that envelope\nPot but now you bring up an interesting point that she may have been trying to influence the ongoing investigation by the inspector general of Andy McCain's conduct right\nWow so and the lawyer who\nLeft the female lawyer is Deborah pass the Clinton more\nSo now\nFor\nA this morning there than there is a story out that says the ADA American Bar association is now urging that vote the host home\nAnd remember yesterday in the questioning I think it might have been Lindsey Graham but someone said the American bar association the gold standard Dave judge Kavanaugh the highest wedding as an impeccable standard of integrity\nAnd they did that was then that was Lindsey Graham yes\nNow today they are urging the vote the post puff for further investigation that's outfit\nNow\nIf you go into if you go on the Internet you put in her name for the laws eight Ford and CIA will discover that her father and her grandfather were high level the IRA offered it\nShe is a professor of psychology professor at Stanford University she is in charge of the CIA internship program at Stanford\nThe fact that she can't give time they play playing those details it she gave them would make it easy to disprove hurt stored the fact that she tells me with those else makes it impossible to disprove her story\nBut if you look at her father and grandfather her grandfather was involved in a money laundering scheme in the eighties for drug money and when Reagan started investigating it\nThey had in a fascinating it's all it's all by name her father was a high level executive at a bank funded black operations of the CIA which was like a hundred steps on the White House and his own partly by black rock look I understand\nYeah I've seen I've seen some of this reporting Jim why don't you just get to the end bottom line is for me what what do you think is at play here\n\nI I Would say is trying to court trial with this operative her story I think he's just trying to force her off with the Supreme Court and ultimately is the the him and Twenty one\nUh well I I I think we we didn't need all the background on on miss Ford to recognize that there are\nElements inside of the never Trump movement the deepest so called deep state\nWho are committed to making sure that Donald Trump does not get a second term because there are far too many people getting burned further illegal activity and I think that ... ... ... ah the Kavanaugh accuser is is one such individual it's all she's ... she's part of a a large machine a cog in large machine\nA vehement anti Trump hers and ... and the average meant status who want to see\nA a government of buy in for the people put a ground into the dirt and I think that's what we're saying hey Jim thinking of the comment I appreciate it to anyone five eighty five seven three two one five I\nCan see being Lewis I appreciate your patience walking because they don't show let's say you\nCan morning a is a great writer for America a great friday I'm just kind of going through the whole thing first of all we can't ask the FBI investigate anything when they can't even get their own house in order for you to wait on that like\nOkay so there there you heard Senator Cruz indignant he knows exactly what happened we all know what happened this was all linked by ... and of course you're going to hear Dianne Feinstein of California\nWasn't me it wouldn't mind they're using\nAn ... an ... how how the media get it then how do I mean if if Mrs Ford didn't release it and our journey didn't release it and it was only you political hacks on the Democrats' side who had that had the media get it\nThat is not a fair process\nAnd we should look to the facts not anonymous innuendo and slammed\nGerman I asked for point of personal privilege to respond surfing Smith Mr Chairman um let me be clear\nI did not hide Dr forged allegations VHS I did not lead her story she asked me to hold and confidential and I kept in confidential as she asked\nShe apparently was started by the press so fast to what happened she was forced to come forward [laughter]\nAs suppresses fault and who does\n... who's betting is the press do\nThe Democrats but Democrats\nIt just magically appeared she was being stalked by the press because your office linked it Dianne Feinstein that's the reason why the press knew what was there\nBecause of rumblings that came out of your office map or the other Democrat lunatic congresswoman\nAnd our greatest fear for realized was realized she's been harassed and she's had death threats because they'll do you\nThink she's had to flee from her home\nIn in addition the investigation that the Republican majority is Harold ing\nIs really nothing that I Know about other than a partner in practice normally all the witnesses would be interviewed however that's not happened while the majority is reached out to several people they did not notify me for my staff that they were doing this\nThat's nonsense the Democrats made up their mind they were not going to participate in any of this\nThere they didn't send representatives to any of the meetings except for judge Kavanaugh the rest of the time the Democrats didn't care because Democrats objective wasn't upon the truth the Democrats objected was delayed delayed delayed delayed delay that was there a gender\nAnd they're saying we waited ... minutes a day in another one a seven to one\nFor judge Kavanaugh and so far to argue\nThat we would not participate but not tell us what they were up to his somewhat disingenuous I was given some information by a woman who was very much afraid to ask you to be held confidential\nAnd your office failed to do so\nAs did the either the congresswoman office or yours either way into the Democrats feet\nAnd I held it confidential until she decided that she would come forward\n[noise] ... would would do the ranking member on [noise] century question please if I can talk\nI Am great respect for sugar response time we worked together on many topics of I Believe what you just ah [noise] when you tell us your staff could not Lincoln's fault I don't believe my staff would lead to know that\nOh you mean what what about the the Chinese spy that was driving you around for Nineteen years\nI don't believe that yeah we we know how credible your staff is Senator Feinstein\nQuestion directly but I Do not know that I Would I mean how in the world and get my hands you ... ... is you know the staff have you have ... have you as your staff for others out there who is your daughter and I\nJust did just now just in the committee hearing she didn't\nAsk them you know ten days ago Twenty years ago did you did you did you leap is she asked them and the committee hearing once a Republican forced her to answer\nAlthough she had a one of her staffers bailed around\nThem and they were pardon me well generals reminds me I've asked her befall\nYes how convenient thank you Jennifer for saving the senile\nAll bad thanks much\nDo I want by my ... to a to point one five A. K. as evening she's lying\nAnd you can all here she's blind Darren welcome to Brazil say it'll show what's going on\nThat first of all I don't know too much money starts up for\nWhat you're saying the money that Sheila Jackson Lee gave to the attorney of Andy McCabe and the attorney representing the cabinet accuser that most of the source of the money was from the butcher shop Planned Parenthood\nFlu expert\nI think you're right I mean I I think that this this cold as yet again you know what we ought to save these accusations so every single time the FBI is ... because we now know the Democrats they ...\nBut these Asian so every single time the FBI is ... because we now know the Democrats they every accusation most deserves an FBI investigation that's all we we we must wait until the FBI investigates one allegation against Sheila Jackson Lee and then we must have another allegation so the FBI will continue to continually have Sheila Jackson Lee under FBI investigations\n\nAre you really would you be willing to put an oath now they're they're going to put you on the road and ask you where you heard this so let me ask you let me let me a while you\n\nKnow are ... are you a journalist\nOr to\nWell if you if you blog or you are you post on her Facebook page you have you have journalistic cover because you are you are both your order I Know yeah there you go there you go up\nSenate Judiciary committee meets to vote on recommending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the meeting is underway right now ladies and gentlemen breaking news wanted to get that out there I'm sure you had other than allegations stored up\nToward ...

[laughter]\nWell no it's very true and don't forget George W Bush's first term he actually added seeds bucking that friend\nSo that the fact that people will say well never happens that's that's not true and there is in particular with Democrats saying that they want to impose a new standard of the country of guilty until proven innocent I think a lot of Americans even Democrats are rightly put off by that\nAnd I don't want my job I'm sure a lot of really make\nSure I appreciate very well thought out and I thank you for\nThe information on Sheila Jackson Lee her parents guilt because we all know that now it's up to it's incumbent upon Sheila Jackson Lee to prove or innocent and we need a complete FBI investigation Sheila Jackson Lee for her her what we're told\nVarious sources now tell

helping out and all the guys that are that were part of that show with\nOr by the way the phone line is to eight one five five eight five seven three eight pounds ... a free called Audi of her eyes and so I've been working on a pretty pretty good remodel its route and we didn't really remodel the pool we had to re plumbed the pool\nBecause of some issues that happened uh when they they added another building to this complex this is a\nThis is a retired or an assisted living retirement complex\nA over off ... and a founder an area that I've been working on for several months we've had some delays unfortunately but uh we actually had to\nJust tear up the deck and read plum all of a swimming pool we added it's a huge them book about sixty five thousand gallons and uh it's uh we put in twenty different returns we've got five different scammers\nWe have two locations of a main drains that are all connected and just lots and lots of water flow\nAh one of the things when you're working with a commercial pool\nThat you have to do is you have to turn over that pool in a six hour period of time and what that means is that you have to pump enough water through the filtration system to where\nIf you started from ground zero at eight o'clock in the morning by two o'clock in the afternoon all the water in that swimming pool would have circulated through that filtration system and in order to do that on this size pool I had to come up with a hundred and sixty gallons a minute\nA which is a lot of water\nA pumping through the system so in order to do that\nI got I got some help from a good friend Tom there's a good buddy of mine and we talked about him not not Tom from a Texan pools my other friend Tom he um\nHe helped me with the hydraulic since we use a three inch pipe these two and a half inch pie we used to a a trip to the skimmers we use that a commercial size of the ads F pump from\nPenn tear which is the variable speed and variables a variable flow pump\nAnd uh you have to honor commercials situation you have to have like these little um flow meters so that you know you the the when you were expected you can make sure that you're pumping enough water to work to do that to fix our turnover rate and um\nSo\nWe got it all going got plastered we've got the towel cleaned up the oh yeah that was another thing I was talking about when I talked about they are getting so so confused right now\nUh when you're doing a simple remodel of your swimming pool then you know just cleaning the tile we have a bean blasting process now that cleans all fall that scale cleans up all that calcium buildup cleans up the ground makes it look like it did when it was brand new I'm not kidding you\nIt's unbelievable and we had to do that with this pool because really the pool had not been properly maintained\nUm that's where ... magic magenta stuff\nReally helps and that's really makes a difference so you really need to use something like that will talk about that little bit later anyway I I'm I'm getting sidetracked here but I was talking about how whenever you jump in your swimming pool do matter how old you are you still feel like a kid\nYou wouldn't believe all these people that live in this assisted living home\nLeave all these people that live in this assisted living home a community which is beautiful I mean these they have beautiful apartments that really a lotta nice people in these all these people are well let's just say they're older than me\n[laughter] and the ... you would think there are kids\nBecause they're all so excited about being able to get their swimming pool to get apparently what happened to the pool happened over two years ago and they haven't been able to use their swimming pool for almost two years a little over two years\nSo it's like at a time I'll say we can we get in the ... side it tell us when we can get in the book and it just reminded me how how being in a swimming pool no matter how old you are\nMakes you feel like a kid again and uh I'm living in almost every day and ... those those people out of bed assisted living a complex are really exciting I got to get over there 'cause they're going to do like water aerobics in classes and stuff like that they have heaters for the swimming pool\nSo that it was it can stay warm for the the later months you know when it gets a little bit chillier outside\nBut um I don't know I just wanted to share that story where the 'cause I Love swimming pools I Love the way they they transform your backyard and if you have a pool\nAnd you you're having any kind of an issue with it give me a call to eight one five five eight five seven three eight or pound K. F. C. V. is a free call on your varieties and one of the reasons that I wanted to do this back yard a radio program\n'cause I not only wanted to share with you my excitement about\n... owning my own swimming pool and about how proud it makes me feel and how great it is for my family and my friends\nBut\nBeing in this industry for over Thirty years now I can walk into someone's backyard who is so frustrated with their swimming pool they just want to get rid of it and you know it's usually something pretty simple that can be\nRelatively easy to fix that's why encourage you to give me a call if you're feeling that way about your pool to eight one five five eight five seven three eight pound KFC the is you're free call\nOn the horizon I'm One of the things that we had to overcome with his big commercial pool I was just talking about and one of the reasons that I had to re plummet\nIs that when it was originally plumbed it was a deficient in other words a it wasn't making that six hour turnover rate\nAnd it just wasn't filtering properly\nAlgae was a huge issue\nEven though that their palms were running twenty four hours a day they couldn't control algae because\nBecause they have so many dead spots in the pool that's why brushing is so important in in in all of your swimming pools 'cause every every swimming pool has dead spots and even this pool after every plummeted with twenty different returns\nHad still have some debt spots or you just can't avoid that um but now with the proper kind of circulation we're not going to have any kind of issues with algae unless the pools just simply not maintained properly\nAnd as you will do pump filter water chemistry and you're going to look great you're pumps run in the ... of hours a day too I like to have your pool circulate enough\nThe turnover at least twice a day now in a residential pool a\nEight hours for a turnover rate is fine\nUm but one\nLike this this commercial pool when I got done and we got it all up and going we needed a hundred and eighty a hundred and sixty gallon submitted to get make that turnover rate would that PIN tear pump we got a hundred and eighty gallons a minute\nYeah that's I mean that may not mean a lot to you your pool or in your backyard may be pumped eighty gallons a minute\nI'm not sure what kind of pump you happen unless you have the hydraulics already set up\nWhich probably most of you don't\nUh I Know a lot of builders today now are starting to go with the larger a plumbing like Cyprus custom pools for a great example they understand hydraulics they they get it they're going to do the bigger piping and therefore you so you'll have a better turnover rate and that's really what it's all about so\nI'm going around and full circle you know all of these things are important for you to know their the underground stuff when you're when you're shopping a pool builder when you're shopping and remodel or because\nYou have some basic questions you can ask them and and let me tell you first of all you can always call me or email me\nAnd asked me questions even if I'm not working on your project 'cause I don't work all over Houston but I can I'm certainly more than happy to help you at least make sure you're asking the right questions and you're getting the right the answers so that year remodeled project goes well um\nBut\nMy point it's saying all this kind of going back to the light conduit and the one inch conduit just asked for it\nIf somebody tells you they need to replace your light conduit just tell 'em I Want you to use one inch conduit if they say oh well that's going to be a lot more money and say yeah I tell you what I'll be glad to go by the conduit for ya\nI'm not kidding yet but it's not that much more money anyway okay I've been rambling I'm going to open the phone lines up to eight one\nFive five eight five seven three eight pound K.
