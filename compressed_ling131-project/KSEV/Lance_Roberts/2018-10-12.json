we say the twenty two trillion dollar debt largely gifted to us from the baby boom generation is a job well done\nCan we say the advancement of liberalism in our society in the baby boom generation is a job well done\nNow does that is that to say that there aren't patriots inside the baby boom generation of course not there is a struggle in every generation the problem is in the Nineteen twenties

want to make is with every person who grew up in the United it's um you know generally speaking your views come from you know your child and your young adult life and as you grow up and become an adult and solidify those huge\nWhatever current events are wherever you live those events really have a formative you know impact on who you become an ... year old you that you adopt so I think\nYou know what you're talking about with the gym the kids are young adults what they're seeing is craziness and the ridiculous atmosphere that we live\nI beat her by the way when you get closer to a window I'm I was a year of your cell phone's cutting out I'm probably every third or fourth word I just want to make sure that folks can here and understand you let me let me as you're moving let me just take up some of the airtime here and just say\nThat yeah I there's a lot of wisdom to what you're saying about people being formed about the generations they come up and and I don't know that I guess I'm gratified in one sense is that some of these\nThese young adults see the behavior of Democrats that we that we've articulated in go I don't want any part of that\nNow there there are some that are highly impressionable\nThat will they they don't have that foundational a grounding from home\nAnd look to these so called leaders and take their cue from those so called leaders and that's what's scary\nYeah and I I completely agree if you hear me better now yes I can okay well so that's that's\nThat are now yes I can\nOkay well so that that's a good point and I also think that you know you look at the demographics of the United states um by age and the baby boom generation the boom because it was such a large increase in population all at once\nAnd that the influence that that generation had was proportional to sort of the size of that age group\nAnd since we've had decreasing sizes of a subsequent generations the each ... so a new generation and the views that they bring into the change that they bring to the country\nHas been marginal compared to that baby boom generation it's when you talked about did the baby boomers have a bigger influence I think that's a definite possibility cheerleader because of that number\nI'm not I'm not I'm not talking about the the the the numbers per se because right now the millennial generation is bigger than the baby boom generation there there are there's a more population there so sizes necessarily\nConcern me it's what ideas in the culture slashed government advance in those particular generation and the idea is that we find acceptable as a culture in\nIn the Nineteen forties this idea of rolling up on your political opposition and shouting them down and driving them out of political office that would have been that would have been on heard of that would have been that would have been a complete lack of decorum\nAnd now as you see that what I Would rationalize the evolution that has happened to the baby boom Generation Z\nA stewardship if you will of the country now all of a sudden you've got\nDemocrat leaders openly calling for it\nYeah I don't know that's I don't watch a good thing let me just say that\nYeah and I I I totally agree I think\nIn today's day and age I Can't speak to\nNecessarily the past and how we got here but I think social media entertainment or the amount of time that people spend actually her day you know eight nine hours a day\nOr allowing themselves to interact with that and as a result interaction leads to influence or whatever they're interacting with influencing their opinion in their behavior\nAnd I think that's part of what we're seeing right\nNow some in Peter my big my big worry is somebody's gonna get killed\nAll all of these folks in the basket of bias

ABC NBC CBS and the local affiliates and your local affiliates and Fox\nIs that and I gotta say Fox News channel is that an a bang up job of saying you know at least asking the question is this the right thing to do somebody's going to get killed\nAnd and one gets the sense that nobody\nIn these and those bastions that I just mentioned would care because they're unhappy there actually seem to be pulling for somebody to die so that the the country knows\nHow unhappy they are so that we will reverse course and stop all this pro Americanism stop all this great economy stop Donald Trump stop or cutting taxes and and give Democrats their power back that seems to be\nThe price that they are trying to exact Peter thank you very much for the call and it's dangerous\nAnd it's dangerous\nAnd I just\nI Can't get behind\nTelephone number two one five eight five seven three two one five eight K. S. E. D. Lewis Black you waited welcome to say do show\nI'm a baby boomer and out and then I think with the ... and the ... and above\nBut I'll tell you what the perfect example of what the baby boomers there and that that would just go in Portland those are the people that ran a commune in Nineteen sixty and they're turning those cities in the army\nLooked at I mean they're they're they're they're letting the fit the conservatives be hacked to letting the police then decide that the fiscal the toilet and now they're even afraid to walk the streets are just the cat whatever diseases out there\nAll right but durable example yeah Hi you're on a toilet\nNot only that they've got to know them into tens of thousands all over the city now now that you know\nI Know that they've got somebody what it is you know they have you they hired and\nFolks out their lowest they've hired and folks on taxpayers' dollars to clean up all the human feces they invited in with their accommodating brother holiday\nNow but you know that that is that the hippie culture\nExactly baby boomers runs San Francisco can we say that's a good thing for them right ... thank you thank you very much Steve ... close talking about this on Fox and friends today he's taken out an op ed\nDecrying what the Democrats have done\nCongressmen it's insist they forgot what happened to you you won't lose your bleeding to death to second base because of Bernie Sanders supporter thought he had to kill all Republicans do they understand that these two range people just need to go sign and their aggression could be the\nTrigger you know you're seeing more and more this from the left and and there's no place for them\nWhat I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is an exciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about you know we're break country\nThat's that celebrates the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there is a way to resolve it you resolve your differences at the ballot box you don't resort to violence and to see leaders hauling on violence that happens in third world nations not in America\nSo again I asked a question\nABC NBC CBS\nFox and the local affiliates and not so much Fox News but the Fox affiliates tolerate this kind of stuff\nSon\n\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nThem you know when they go low we\nMay go low we didn't [noise]\nI'll ask you a question as we go to break\nIf a Republican we're doing that with all of those affiliates\nThat I mentioned ABC NBC CBS CNN where they remain silent [noise] no no they're out they're banning the word mom to describe their left wing base I mean I mean they're left wing vase\nVascular bites Trump said a few weeks ago Democrats are the media the media are the Democrats the basket of biased press\nYou know a huge you know if the if the ... faces filing woken up and they'll vote for work and every time I see that I just hit the feeling because excuse me the current senator\nSenator Ted Cruz is Hispanic\n[laughter] if zero Hispanic fear right now so yeah that is\nWhy we have run a ah right now and uh so so sudden\nOver yet don't forget in the last election the last ... election lieutenant governor and the governor of the the great state of Texas Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick\nThey garnered fifty six percent four percent of the male Latino votes so this idea that the Latino Hispanics orange stupid is the basket of biased press thinks they are I\nThink they're in for a rude awakening come election day as far as Hispanic turnout for\nA while I'll die we called beta beta or work because he he made a male he's made a male each class it he's he's not like Donald Trump or a fighter like Ted Cruz a folks were ... talking to 'em a prime alone immediate equalizer they put up a couple of billboards here in the state of Texas some Spanish

campaign for taking among other things [noise] foreign donations\nA which is again once a criminal always a criminal in my mind are you guys are not only focusing on our race do you guys are focusing on other key races\nWhile we are we're also looking at Florida we're also looking into that at Arizona but I guess we started with tax because the one that makes us angry is I think just\nTo feed and

there he is Obama's hand picked\nA governor running on extreme locked away or you know stances\nSo we've got some really amazing to me about this election is there are a couple of dozen big races that are neck and neck that if we really stepped up our efforts as conservatives right now they're all wind up all all of them\nSo I don't know what you know I I think if we can just get people stirred up enough here I think we can get a we can have a credible election day opportunities across the country we're now seeing races that we didn't have a prayer of winning just a few weeks ago now with no ... to\nYellow because well because yeah because the Democrats basically shot themselves in the foot with the way they behaved with cabinet look I'm I'm\nI'm honored and gratified you chose Texas tremendous off that means that means you guys have a little bit of a deficit to be able to expand those similar type billboards an advertising into the other races you mentioned like and what can we do as conservatives to help you guys out\n... so we are raising money or to add more billboards the factory raise that there's still time to put more billboards if we get going right away suggest if

which way I'm leaning on this but we'll get your take is well Kanye West wishing that you gave a gift Donald Trump yesterday he modified the make\nAmerica great again\nAnd he wants Trump and an NFL figure to wear the hats\nHave horses because we need to focus on who we are now today\nI really do I actually wrong in that transition to follow it I made a mirror to do that\nIt was sort of follow it

most sense to me and let me ask you folks in the in the black community who have called up the show and lamented the fact that the Democratic party has disintegrated the the black family\nAnd here's Kanye West giving voice to that and no wonder Don lime\nA wet himself over stuff like this already\nBut if you\nThat gives me powers talking about the make America great again hat America had\nYou
