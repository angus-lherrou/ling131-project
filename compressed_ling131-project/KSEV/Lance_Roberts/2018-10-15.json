Bill Clinton and he should have been thrown out of office he should step down\nBut but you notice how she has to pay the back of Trump whose allegations were long before he was ever president extramarital affairs and the light although all the unwanted advances have never been proven\nAnd even some of those stories have been recanted they were paid so here's Hillary Clinton again telling that Lauer up when Matt Lauer asked back in Ninety two you know about him stepping down\nLet me take you and your husband out of this for a second bill and Hillary Clinton are involved in this story is an American president hadn't adulterous lives on in the White House in lie to cover it up shouldn't the American people asked for his resignation while they should certainly be concerned about it should they asked for his resignation\nWell I think that if all that work or the true I think that would be a very serious event are not going to be proven Trenton New I think we're going to find some other things and I think that\nWhen all of this is put into context and we really look at the people involved here the people involved the accusers you mean right Mrs Clinton or look at their motivations look at their background out their past behavior\nSome folks are going to have a lot to answer farm I see it\nSolve their fault it's all their fault for daring to accused the great Bill Clinton\nIt's all their fault for daring to accused of rape Bill Clinton\nThis woman's a liar this woman is the standard\nBearer for her political party the Democrat Party\nAnd I just thought you ought to know we're going to get to do what Donald Trump's interview with Leslie stall again but those are just tuning in I don't know why the president continues to go to these biased people to do interviews I Would caution against it\nAnd certainly don't do taped interviews with the likes of CBS given what NBC News did over the weekend deceptively editing a clip trying to paint the president once again as a racist and I'll get to that in a minute let me get your calls in hood they give her wedding welcome to sell Saito show\nI think you are missing the big story about that angles ...\nI think you are ankles you mean chemicals and\nYet fat candles mhm why is no one talks about the fact that she\nOkay ask for her security clearance to be removed no I think she I think there's a bigger story there something is getting ready to go down I I I Want everybody out there you start looking and I'm not a conspiracy theorists I'm not the things are coming out look\nDo some research on cue and on\nI Know a lot of folks who who watch ... and I got to say about he went on they they have some dirt and its credible dirt on some people talk\nAbout but Hillary and and also\n... God save with Hillary 'cause I Know where you're going with this go ahead something\nIs getting ready to go down with ... no one gives up there ... no one look at Britain and yet he he had these are ... she was going to give his up\nAnd and you know some people think that this woman wants to run for president again well she can't now she and her security clearance taken away from her ... she asked for to be taken away I'm telling you something is getting ready to go down because she's a traitor to this country along with her six husband\nBut I Want people to look there's a video out there right after the FBI report and this this is part of a Q A non thing right after the FBI report came out on on capping off the fear there's a video with Chuck Schumer and dying finds the and the fear in Feinstein side it's\nPretty powerful silo thing that ... lead terrified I've seen it at all talking about\nAlso there's the video and I'm please I'm not and that's what I saw this there was one of the reasons Lindsey Graham has come to Jesus are you seeing his wife at the funeral of John McCain uh-huh\nThere is a mad dog Mattis and and John Kelly who in even in cities is an intimidating person he uh Lindsey Graham hugs whom Aberdeen Hillary Clinton's lover hugs who may have a name\nAnd then John he looks silver and John Kelly puts his white index finger to his eyes and is scaring right Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham drops his head puts his hand in his pocket and socks off well it's it's extremely powerful\nBody language aside body language decide I Will I Will concede somebody somewhere in the Trump Administration has has continued to investigate Hillary Clinton I Can't say it's Jeff Sessions and I can say it's raw down there and\nThey're saying they're over fifty thousand sealed indictments I don't believe that ... that are getting ready to drop they're calling it Red October yeah it's hard to believe but I'm telling you Donald Trump\nCan you imagine I may ask really quick can you imagine Jeff Sessions as much as a hold on him and he's been the he checked in something like this some sweeping I tell ya\nOff I think this whole thing is a big poker game I think Jeff Sessions is is something tells me that this Mueller investigation and Jeff Sessions saying is a big smokescreen do not I I have been caught under estimating Donald Trump never again and again\nHood thank you very much for the call I appreciate it Lewis you're up next welcome to sell said oh she'll let's say you\nGet Margaret actually hang in uh I I understand where it's coming from because they'll say well these are\nCrying out to somebody that's a good mix of reality and some of it's a good mix of wishful thinking uh because if there is somebody working inside of the from the ministry and it's not the department of justice they're having to work around and under the nose of the apartment of justice because they they are thoroughly corrupt\nNow that I read them are like all this morning or what about you know you're mentioning earlier about you know like you know white man and you know right basically you know with with her but you know as a\nA um liberty loving left you know also that has a a wonderful a wife who who is Caucasian that um\nYou know she was not very political into this go around and it was ... it could stir per se it was Hillary they convinced her to vote for Donald Trump is for for the first time in the presidential you know a election cycle was her first time voting and she wouldn't vote for Donald cook it\nWell her first time voting\nYes her first time voting yes you know and and and it was Hillary they convince or waves of her friends who were very liberal and you know one of the ... and all that but I'm the guy but it was Hillary who convinced my wife to vote Republican not what mommy [laughter]\nYeah well no you know what I and I think this is this\nIs the Democrat Party trying to deflect blame from their own failures and I think there's a lot I mean remember with a Democrat they're never to blame they always blame other people for their failures Hillary Clinton tried to blame everybody else for her loss\nWhen really she was the most on likeable disgraceful candidate she she told women everywhere you don't vote for me or betray are true your gender you don't vote for me\nAh you're stupid just just like Michelle that that a fake journalist Michelle Bernard tried to do oh no all your white women you guys are too stupid to vote for yourselves\nLewis your your your point\nAbout your wife's independence and you know guys really tell me how many of your wives or a subscribe to this a little later you're going to vote how daddy tells you to vote\nHow many how many of you have women that you're married to that actually go oh OK honey I'll do that\nLewis is that your wife no but but ... and my wife either ...\nOne of my life which actually will ask about you know the questions of the day or like the topics of the you know what what\nWhat I mean she will bash you she she doesn't believe that you're automatically a womanizer that you're you have toxic masculinity she actually talks with you and me\nI'm the one because I'm the one that goes out and does the research and then I had a we have a family meeting and they say mom who to vote for and I\nPoint out and I'm trying to teach my children how to look things up themselves but they're busy with school and on but you know my husband has always you know the one\nThing is you sabotage me Chris\nI Would wind or a well George Bush I did not want anyone to vote for him I was the only one that voted against him\nYeah we had you [laughter]\nKnow why why why because I mean I I mean I've I've had\nThe George Bush on the on the program before we haven't come out against anything now why why because of me\nBecause my husband trust you\nAll are I I think I see well I got a cat and I I mean I Know that he I Know that George pie is taking a lot of golf over the reimagining of the Alamo I just you know the last thing I Want to see in the Alamo turn to dust because out of neglect\nAnd those who stayed at the history of what's going on with the Senate tapping the Alamo and their their eyes are going to be open once you get an idea of what the what the up\nAnd just because he's a Bush doesn't mean that he's necessarily anti Trump he's the only Bush came out for Trump as a matter of fact so that those things you got to keep in mind for that guy but but I don't mind\nThe okay very good but as far as setting the agenda do you say oh you know what whatever my hobby does I Do or is it no more of the other way around\nYeah and I and I guarantee you that for the women got the votes they had more power because their husbands were listening to them the ... and here's another thing have you heard the one hand that rock the cradle is the hand that rules the world\nOh well you know I've I've I've seen the movie [laughter]\nBut I've never ran into now never heard of a Hawaiian\nComes from the Eighteen hundreds mhm and the whole point of the coin\nThat those who raised children ways how the world is going to one the next generation\nThat is why you are a threat to the Democrats and weren't actually you are home schooling your children you refuse to get them into the indoctrination centers that are the ... and you are you are a proactive and this is why bother my can I ask are you white\nYes this is why Hillary Clinton fears you this is what the Democratic Party every year than\nWhite women it's Latino women Asian women even Muslim women you know they don't want a conservative Muslims to be seen either one\nSaying oh well you know now there's a there's a turning point in the black community to know that oh yeah and I meant that too I meant that you absolutely\nA lot of black women are like wait a minute and a ... ... there's a I don't know if you saw this gather there was a a billboard up in Dallas and I don't know if it's made its way down here yet but it's it's the most offensive thing you've ever seen it's three black women pictured ... you know talking about abortion being healthcare and at that abortion is good for you in other words and\nTheir advertising gearing towards and many blacks or going wait a minute\nWhat why are you hearing that toward me why isn't it several women of all races why why do you think that abortion is only good for we black women and many black women are going ha really so yeah I Want to send the issue and that's what\nThat was me it was really what are you know and once you get past that what you start digging into it and you start getting very angry because she realized she'd been to see all your life\nAnd they might have ended at a cafe or say out of your husband former tell them they give her trusting me and thank you for calling on the program look I folks ... we heard of the ladies this morning I wasn't I wasn't expecting to get that I mean most women dismissed Hillary out of hand champion for women\nMile up ...

Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign on election I have a metal but I think China metal to China than you want to do something I said why why do you say China\nBecause we see in

I mean part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that\n[laughter] giving themselves some blame I've I've made the economy so good that illegal aliens continue to pour in your but you guys can hear the points\nYou guys can hear how this interview was edited\nOut of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states and I just ask for simple question yes or no\nSimple question yes or no because you know illegal immigration Leslie stall is so simple and say yes or no question\nYou say good grief and I are you willing to reinstitute that policy you said we're looking at everything I mean if I'm Alone\nLying to reinstitute that policy you said we're looking at everything I mean half I'm lowering out and you can say yes or no what I can say that there are consequences from coming into a country namely our country illegally I'm not going to ask and again we don't have the same as Obama okay\nYeah it's the same it's the it's a law that Obama didn't follow and now Leslie stall of CBS wants to condemn this president for following the law\nNow this is another example Mr President this is a prime example of the basket of bias setting up a narrative to make you look like an idiot\nMichael comes on the heels of a series of super storms Florence in the Carolinas Maria in Puerto Rico Harvey in Texas do you still think that climate change because of how\nGood grief so she she details\nThe storms with our weather phenomenon not climate\nThere was no conclusive data that the reason why we're seeing a more powerful storms is because of manmade global warming that we're going to be going through a warming cycle inside of the oceans\nUp it's a it's a fact the reason why Michael strengthened the way it did was because the Gulf water with two degrees warmer than it normally would be at this time of the year that's that is definitive but you can't pin that the ocean temperature on man\nConclusively you can't\nElse I Would be able to see a formula out there that says well if this amount of seal too in the in the air this is how much degree change you're going to get that does not exist nor will exist because you can't prove it our modern science at this point can't prove it\nAnd right now we're going through or solar minimum my friends you're going to see global temperatures dropping well wait a minute how does that fit into the manmade global warming myth\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again\nThank goodness thank goodness our climate changes elves we'd be at a volcanic waste land up and never did or we'd be in it would be in a tropical jungle all over the world if ... if America and the rest of the world or under climate conditions millennia go\nIt's\nWarped frankly ladies and gentlemen if we were under the ice age more and more people died more animals died for lack of food thank goodness things warmed up\nI don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um [noise] I don't want to use dreams and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you could go to Greenland\nAs watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea levels and you don't know whether or not who would have happened with or without man you'd\nYeah exactly and here's Leslie stall putting it out there as fact you see that this is where the basket of bias says well the the debates over its all fact now even though it's still a theory nothing has been proven absolute rubbish\nDon't know when you're a scientist yours scientists said no no I haven't had a judge said disagree with that you know I I was thinking what if he said now as I've seen the hurricane situation I've changed my mind how good it really is climate change and I thought wow what an impact\nWhat an inland will I mean I'm not denying climate change\nYeah exactly the climate's changing he just saying the man's not driving it\nBut it could very well go back you know we're talking about on the news is they say that we are and hurricanes that were far worse than when we just said was Michael\nSays that they say they say that in one of my main scientists some say it's worse than ever\nYou have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda socially camp or English and just also have a political agenda yeah\nThey do many of them tailor their research in their answers directed toward funding for their particular projects we notice each dangling university and others who are making money off of the the climate change theory the manmade global warming theory\nAnd that's all it is\nAnd ignoring the big ball of light in the sky then Trump\nTalks about\nIllegal immigration\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing\nRight Obama had the same thing that's where we started and then the conversation continues\nAre you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration all I Want all the laws change jak consequences Lesley from coming into our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason that I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states and I just ask the simple question yes or no are you willing to reinstitute that policy you said we're looking at everything a math I Am a lawyer and you can say yes or no what I can say that\nThere are consequences from coming into a country namely our country illegally I'm not going to ask and then you don't have your your mom okay changing objects again and you are the first president to the United states who never had a political posed for for\nFor ... never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years now what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president okay\nMr Trump answered that question coming up next and er it centers around the basket of bias press my friend's way to you hear this answer we'll get your reaction\nTo what the president had to say coming up with of course they do show on the voice\nYou know granted drank a little too much so\nNBC and there's Ellison is to show Donald Trump to be a racist\nAnd there was Allison's just said oh it was used for rentals each for the better\nThey these people\nWill stop at nothing this is why you don't give them a pre taped interviews this is why frankly I don't think it should be doing any interviews with them\nBecause the dishonest blatantly dishonest you don't reward\nNBC News or CBS News when their coverage is slanted as it is with an interview you don't do that residents Obama viewed Fox News as\nSlanted so he'd never appeared on their newscasts never went there what three times his entire eight years\nTo anyone five eight seven three I Do I Want five at a KFC Spencer I'm Glad you waited welcome to sound sado show\nGroups here the gold standard of warning to pay you sir I should of course everybody\nKnows that anywhere I'll get right to it on and this is ... later on we have black about our country was a thousand plus each or in the past ten years\nYou know in in various state legislatures national races and how what we're doing what the what what has gone on notice is jokes shores has a program urban sorority various secretaries of state\nIn two um all of these states and there are the ones who certified elections you remember palm Pam Bondi in two thousand election in Florida oh she was at the summer that fire storm and because she sort of part of Bush at the time I Do remember that\nYes\nAnd she was attacked mercilessly will sunset time a sort of like you have to recognize that they're the ones with the power and I definitely afraid that the jury secretaries of state will I'm the only the election results\nWell the good news is is that the I think\nThe last time I checked I think the Republicans had either thirty or thirty one [laughter] state legislature and governorships so ah they they can they can screw with a vote all they want I suppose unless unless the unless it affects down ballot then that that's a bit of a problem\nBut what about Saddam and his shift work the government or don't want to sort of Fabio ...\nNo no they're secretary of state so I Know I I understand what you're saying but uh but there there is a shack and many of those governments of those secretaries of state that's what I'm proud of hope so thank you spent driver initiate the call thank you blow Patrick you're up next welcome to John said oh show\nHey there has it gone on a Monday morning doing well thank you for being here\nI thank you for taking my call I listen I have two questions when I say I have a statement in a Christian my statement is Trump he calls the um the media fake\nNews for you at any given them an interview now [noise] uh I'm kinda like here in a puzzled about that because I'm sure someone in his cabinet and apply to them about doing that and\nMe to go and how I I don't get it I don't know why it ... and he says they're dishonest why do you show up\nRight so I'm kind of kids under you and not so we'll hope to get to the bottom of it you know building in rather than later gave my personal views about this year and then you're great good educated man in the business here a politics\nIf this reporter was killed in Saudi Arabia and the Saudis sent the president a Mets fan that you know a ... in other words um if you pull out of his deal here there will be held to play\nTheir pay and I and I believe the Saudis on that word when they say are Trump loaded it than that I'm no matter what he's not going to no matter what hotter than they left the gate and turns out\nHe doesn't want her legal and as we'll hear so my personal view how much money are we get it from the Saudi and and and and in other words how much we will\nAll they can call in this country the welfare liberate them as women\nYeah folks with Patrick is talking about is this critic of the Saudi family that the crown prince could show he is his last name and he was looking for divorce papers are understanding is he shows up the Saudi and bat or a\nA council it or the or the ambassador's residence and I think it was was it turkey which country wasn't he goes into an end of the Saudi constantly and he never comes up and\nAnd yeah it was this temple existed ... turkey I Believe is where he went into this\nInto this a complex and then he's been a frequent critic of the crown prince he was there to pick up documents and he never comes out\nSo it is widely theorized Patrick that that this could show the guy a journalist who worked for the Washington Post which killed which chopped up into little pieces and taken out of the Saudi a consulate\nIn part never to be heard from again is rumored that in Saudi crown prince who has been labeled up until now former you know giving women the right to drive and all of this kind of\nStuff um that that he ordered the hit because this guy was very critical of the royal family or the house of Saud and the crown prince in particular\nAnd the United states just paint a deal for arms sales to the Saudi kingdom\nIt's not that they're paying us Patrick that has the president and other elected leaders concerned\nIt's the strategic partnership that Saudi Arabia performing we thought reforming Saudi Arabia provides for the United states in that region Saudi Arabia has positioned itself as stark enemies of the Iranian regime Saudis being Sunni\nOr the Iranian regime being she uh and\nIn Sunni or the Iranian regime being she uh\nAnd they are the two big boys on the block that are that way you know battling for control of the Muslim street the Muslim world\nSo it's not only that there are also a a ... a strategic partner in that respect also a strategic partner as far as oil is concern even though now and the United states has turned into a net exporter they are they still have the ability to affect world markets\nWith with their oil reserves so we have to tread lightly however there are bipartisan\nSenators who are in and actually the president's come out and said if this is what it proves to be there will be the president's words hell to pay for the Saudis if they did this because in America we don't support the chopping up of [noise]\nOf journalists [noise]\nAs to whether they be biased or fair we don't\nLike to chop them up into little pieces and kill them [noise]\nAnd no American president no senator no elected leader should wants to do that either\nThis is all going to come out in the wash [noise]\nBut my my sense is\nIf it's irrefutable evidence\nThe president won't have any choice\nTo do something that is real and concrete because there'll be his hand will be forced by Congress [noise]\nThat any political parties where the sacrifice themselves\nThe life of a Saudi prince\nWho may have overstepped or may not we don't know yet we're going to find out the question\nJoy won by by by southern forget do I want five ha STV the violence continues in the last fall
