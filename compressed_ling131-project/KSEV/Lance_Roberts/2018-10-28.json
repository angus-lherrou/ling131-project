scale I Can't remember one\nNo I I Can't either I mean I guess if if you want to call Timothy McVeigh a a a right winger I suppose the Oklahoma City bombing and what and what what happened there but I mean I can I might be a stretch\nBut yeah it yeah like she does more yeah well he was more of an anarchist than a than a than a conservative and the court's conservatives are primarily a fixed an inherent to the to the constitution which has the exact opposite of anarchy but no Peter I like I said none none of this passes the smell test\nAnd it's all too conveniently politically time and it it is designed it just seems to be a\n... on the surface of political gift to one political party and that ended up itself is is creating tons of skepticism out there and it ought to thank you for the call buddy I appreciated Cathy you're up next appreciate your wedding as long as you have lady what's going on\nI ... I don't like how they say the candidate that I'm volunteering for I haven't had permission to an All right I Want to tell you what a friend of mine that are volunteering or experienced a yesterday or this week a Democrat [laughter] why\nWhy fat at this young lady\nThat was falling tearing spat Iraq yeah that's\nYou know what I'm Sorry but I Know it's not physical or a a harmful no but it is an assault\nHe went by\nA physical or a harmful no but it is an insult\nYou went by herself so I she called her bleeding now she she didn't know what to do I know she should have a I'm going to go and help her\nToday um they [noise] another time\nAnother friend of mine got flipped off he handed uh pushing hard they rented off up and you know this is the kind of demeanor that is left with the Democrat Party they are they are ugly this shift\nEvil people I I don't mean I I think the people that this way are probably the activists on an exit strategy said already\nLook at what their leaders are saying they look at what Hillary I'm not saying there's not going to be any civility until Democrats when\nYou've got Maxine Waters out they're calling for the mobs you've got Sheila Jackson leaves office releasing the information of where to find Republicans you've got fright liberal Bernie Sanders supporters shooting at Republicans this is we've been treated to all of this ... antifa thug showing up on our streets\nKicking the garbage out of out of prayer marches you've got black lives matter up and up in Dallas gunning down police officers saying hey how many ... that I did I kill the white cops I mean this is the level of hate that we have seen since the election Donald Trump it's absolute idiocy\nI I wouldn't like to encourage the volunteers and people just going to vote to understand that this is a strategy they want to incite you to come after them\nAnd ... you [noise]\nBut yeah it either intimidate or be able to it would make them very happy if somebody would take a swing at um yeah and this and and I know this from my son when he was young like seven eight years old there was a kid in the neighborhood that was let any hassle\n[laughter] around parents right around\nKids he would do things yeah to a bully and take control\nKind of like ... [laughter]\nThere you go buy a design was not going to\nKeep you as a fighter and he we were holding him back telling him he can't do this or that and yeah one day he he did the wrong thing he he called me a name [laughter] my son went after him and he was a little\n... but now\nThat we lose me yeah I gather you cut out there for a minute but I'll I'll take the opportunity great story and you're right you can't you can't succumb to the taunting of these people are I Would recommend and folks we had a segment on this\nIf you're getting intimidation from left wing or is it the polling place Utah to the election judges\n... and I again and either party if if it's a Democrat election judge only there and what you shouldn't be the case in Harris County anyway\nUh but if it's if it's that the case and they don't do anything when you call the police but you should not be spat upon you should not be harassed anywhere near the polling place anywhere within a hundred feet of that entrance\nAnd um you know and they can outside of that they can be ... Democrats voted out that's okay that's free speech but if they get in your face they they impede your progress they physically touch or or harm you or try to even spinning upon you this falls that's that's an assault\nOr then you call the police this type of intimidation cannot be tolerated do I want five I think five seven three two one five at a KFC me All right well Ken because they'll say they'll show let's say you\nDon't believe one last caller fish she sounds just like a typical she got some faith and make no sense it was manufactured story um you'll see you and me\nAnd I'm not very boisterous out just because you just for you to every day on the radio\nTo amuse all of us so we appreciate that you have multiple occasions um mentioned regretting destroyed you most of the folks who disagree with you but I'm I'm a black lives matter is responsible for the killing of police officers you said multiple times am I correct\nThat is true of yesterday's or\nA debate the fact that you've done so they should be called the police would be killed and she you know what what you have to go\nUh I I don't think it has anything it's not germane to the conversation but I Would I Would\nBe the one you become that goes on murder so my question to you and it was a white man kill cops it away or you didn't like me I guess\nYou know there there there there is no white group out there supporting them right or they don't they don't fly under the banner of black lives matter that as soon as this individual good up in Dallas\nRight so in one person who claimed member who will just do it by the way it used to draw because you shouldn't you know\nWhich I find it amazing that could look up to ... clipping I'm not sure killed on the cooking so he was shocked when the mother right\n... like I Am I'm\nComing up against the clock so I Want to make sure I give his innocence you hurled and insulted me let me educates you sir\nYeah let let let me educate living it lemonade educate you limit educated\nYou are for making the ignorance Damon she just made the tax breaks\nThe individual who shot those five police officers up in Dallas articulated to the police officers that he was running for white people\nDo you understand the difference between somebody who just a random white guy who's out there killing tops which is wrong who didn't do it for necessarily racial reasons just wanted to go out and kill a cop and the difference need somebody who said that I get Whitey sounds ... they he sounds kind of angry like you write\nHe kind of sounds angry and in spite of all ... just like you and the fact that you didn't know about little fact about this man articulating to police officers\nThat I did I killed the white cops he wanted to kill white people he he ... that's the definition of a hate crimes are and the fact that you don't know the difference shows your ignorance thank you for the\nCall I appreciate your way one five eight five seven three two one five or they can see the folks\nWill be [noise]\nThere's this and said oh she'll actually in which we've adopted from a very well known saying\nIt's better to be thought a fool\nThan to open your mouth and confirm it for everybody and right just confirmed how much of a fool he was [noise] is and continues to be\nBut you continue to call All right I'll continue to let you left his show how big it hits you are on this program thanks very much be right back\nI don't think we should uh\nWhoever sent these devices whatever they are bombs or or what some call false flags this person ought to be caught ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nA no doubt about it I don't care who it is whether it's a conservative whether it's a liberal whether it's a foreign entity\nAre they ought to be caught and I and I think they will be but\nLook and none of this is happening in a in a political vacuum I think there is one political party that is struggling to remain relevant\nAnd if the Democrat Party\nThe Democrat Party is the party of a foreigner Democrat Party is open borders anti law enforcement anti cop anti Jewish anti Christian anti white that's the Democrat Party today you heard\nThe ah the last break from a guy named right who was borderline excusing violence against whites\nAnd in calling me stupid for not for not accepting it's it's dangerous where this is headed\nAnd I've been saying this as we have watched the left wing and their leaders like Hillary Clinton beta or Rourke\nFeed the feed these flames of violence to their supporters\nWhere we are getting stories now voter intimidation of the polls left wing or do you vote for beta you're better off with the ... seriously really in America\nIn America\nThere is one side of the political ... who was saying you no longer have a presumption of innocence in America you're guilty until proven innocent really in America\nIt's not the Republican Party my friends\nAnd it's all for hate sick\nIt's all for hate and it isn't us Lauren Hill walk in the criminal say it'll show what's going on\nGood morning Chris how a just a couple of comments um release comment about we were founded on violence he really needs to read the history a little bit in more detail\nAnd he has a perspective I I understand it but I don't agree with it\nYeah we go back two thousand years we we progress we evolve um you cannot judge past actions by president mores you try to change the things that are wrong\nAnd we have and we have to a great degree in this country the wrongs this country of the best country on the planet in my humble opinion lower hill and\nThe ... the fact that we have had some some black eyes throughout history in this country we've had the capacity to solve those problems and unite behind our constitution our rights and liberties and our freedoms and our prosperity but not today I read it\nAnd also um the comments about the moms has anybody address the fact that they were sent to people who do not open their own nail\nRight right\nAnd well yeah yeah and and then some of them don't have postage some of them are mean meaning they they've actually been through the postal service um some of them some of them are all of them are have been diverted actually with the exception of De Niro to the secret service\nAnd last but not least talking to right have you have argued with the child [noise]\n[noise] yes yeah it's\nThe exact same thing they try to change the subject they try to twist what you say it it thinking about the boys I'm going that sounds exactly like what they tried to do when they were nine ten years old\nYeah well the only difference between right and the child is that my children wouldn't wouldn't dare lead with oh you're an idiot or you know you're a dummy early and wouldn't wouldn't degrades you are when they're when they're talking to you I mean I don't know if you've heard liberal Greg's call but he was\nMuch the same thing he brings up a topic when I Would sufficiently swat that down he wants to talk about something else will do it but but he he made it they don't want to stay focused they just want to be able to come on this program\nHurl their insults degrade people and that's all they offer the country right right and gray and all the left wing or all they offer his division in hate\nBecause you didn't hear you didn't hear any of them say look Chris how can we come together and talk about this here's my perspective what's yours how can we solve it all they want to do is just\nDo grade to grade to grade and hammer and hammer and hammer and harming harming harm and I and\nThe reason why they are allowed on this program is because they do just that you know what was the last time you heard a liberal come on the air and say that look let's unless you when I talk about what we can agree on they don't\nAsk don't debate yeah or they don't take sides no don't do it name calling it it's like I said it's like it's like talking to a child don't drive mouthing I agree with you my children never called ... idiot [laughter] probably not be on the planet if I had\nNo you um you cannot discuss with them you know it's\nIt's tough it's tough finding anybody on the left wants to say well you know what I don't like we're we're going either\nHe found the left wants to say well you know what I don't like we're we're going either how do we unite working you and I as a liberal and conservative come together to help stop is that it says that doesn't happen anymore [noise]\nI mean why would it when you've got Maxine Waters doing what she's doing Sheila Jackson leaves office doing what they're doing [noise] Hillary Clinton saying what she said well there'll be no peace until Democrats when really [noise]\nOkay [noise] do I want vice over three I Do I Want

F. C. V. A. three call on your horizon I'm so excited I was so excited about coming on the radio show today because\nI got so much I got to share with you I had a really great long talk with Jack bean jak being in the odor object magic which you know we talk about all the jacks magic products a lot here on the back yard a radio program the metal sequestering agents um the the the um [noise]\nUh all kinds of stuff to filter it cleaning material or all that is really some of the fine stuff that jak does on his\nHis his line of inventory but I talked to them today about water chemistry about today it was a couple of days ago\nAnd you know as long as I've been doing this over Thirty years it never ceases to amaze me how every day I can learn something new so we're gonna talk about some really interesting things that I found out today about your water can receive that you may not know about\nAnd that can really save you a lot of time because that's what our model years in here in the back yard a radio program is to save your time\nThan we were running that this the al ... around a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty\nAnd the ph was running around seven six\nThat was the problem\nWe were in a ... point seven saturation index that's high the highest you want to go to the saturation index goes from point zero three point three\nIf you're more than point zero three then you're in a very corrosive water environment meaning the ass acidity level is much lower in that water\nAnd it will deteriorates your plaster ... either way the copper and the heat exchange or it it can cause damage to the elements and it's just not a good situation\nIf you're over point three now\nIt's going to be in a scaling environment for the water which is quite the opposite which means there's a lot of calcium and scale that can be built up quickly in the water\nSo we talked a little bit further well in all my tools we use jacks magic magenta stuff\nDiligent this stuff into metal sequestering age at which removes the metals and minerals the calcium and scale build up from the water it puts it all in the western state\nKnow a lot of you are using the magenta stuff as well puts it all it it's a question of state\nAnd then what is it do with it that's what jak asked me\nWhat is it do with it yeah it puts it ended up failed her so the reason why our filters were starting to back up it's because the calcium harness levels even though they were in normal range is\nWhen you have to hire\nA alcohol at AT T and P. H. and hire a sign Eric answered levels then you need to actually run the al ... lower so that it gets the evacuation index into a balance I Know maybe that sounded boring [laughter]\nBut I was so excited to find out that that it's just a matter of lowering our alcohol energy and keeping everything in the saturation index balance\nAnd uh it's not that hard to do I mean what you want to do really is it's just bring a water sample and you could even bring it into one of our stores bill or pools out in Pasadena or course any one of the seven area local a Texan pools we test your\nWater for free and we test for the saturation index it prints it right out right there and you're going to know right then and there if your if your water is it a is it a scaling or if it's in a corrosive\nEnvironment and you don't want it like that and that's why we always recommend to take your water in because then we can balance it for you when you can make sure everything's right so\nIt just never ceases to amaze me how whenever I have conversations with Jack I've known jak for oh almost twenty five years now\nAnd a bit of a really good friend and mentor and a great supporter of the backyard a radio program one of the original sponsors on my dad since the first day we started doing this radio program on October eleventh\nTwo thousand one\nWhen I was working with mark McCoy which I'm hoping working are going to start working getting together and that needs to show will get a lot better [laughter]\nHoping working are going to start working getting together and that needs to show will get a lot better [laughter] um but we started jak was right there to support the show he realized the value of bringing you good solid information about how to take care of your swimming pools I mean let's face it\nYou know I'm not the kind of person that ever going to\nSell you something just because they're a sponsor I Do do things that way we don't do the show that way the show where we started the show a with integrity and quality we will I insisted that every may admit manufacture and product\nAnd a company that was a sponsor of the backyard may radio program that we've added\nWe made sure the products did what they say they were going to do that the companies did what they say they were going to do\nAnd that we were in good company and in the way that we do business and Jack of course pop with a list of something like that so yeah I'm doing a big plug for his products but I Can't stress enough\nThe importance of using a metal sequestering aged and jak magic them agenda stuff is by my\nAs far as I'm concerned\nTruly is the strongest the best metal sequestering agent on the market today and you can get it all seminary local Texan tools andme Miller pools or you can't get it everywhere I'm going to tell you that right now they're going to try to tell you something else and it's not going to be as good a promise you\nAre one bottle handles Fifteen thousand gallons worth of water\nAnd a great for startups great for a maintenance it helps prevent your your pool from standing\nAnd it helps to sequester any extra minerals out and then put some in the filter so if you have a balanced right if the water is balanced and you won't have that problem you're going to have longer cycles\nOn your cartridge filters and longer cycles between back washing your D.
