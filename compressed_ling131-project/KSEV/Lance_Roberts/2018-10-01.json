give you were typing the Democratic party is merely the afterlives trying to convert everybody else to their face and and then anyone who doesn't get on board\nI don't disagree I I don't disagree and again remember I didn't say that they were ... and maybe I did I say that a Feinstein was God less well she is\nIn a in a way God Bless because uh I'm from my perspective as a Catholic there's one true garden and uh she she [laughter] worships government as you rightly point out some of my mind the broader point was her animosity toward our people of faith and and Catholics in particular and whatever service she's doing Keith\nOr whoever she serving it isn't it isn't people to California and it isn't um ah\nAh this this nation whatever God she is serving\nShe she has a vehement and demonstrated hatred and bigotry tort Catholics and that that was the broader\nPoint but I agree with everything you just said so what do you see this all going bishop now what ... what Mike weren't weren't where or catering the FBI investigation mode right now do you think the Democrats will go well since we had this week an investigation or everything is hunky dory and let's just go ahead and get it over with\nOf course not no not ... they want to drop the south they want to do whatever they can and so here's another one for five or ... ... um instead of Spanish Inquisition which is wasn't improper use of power\nFrom my supposedly you know from a a well let's just say it was inappropriate use the power\nWhat she and her for doing is not that different so instead of putting people on the Iraq [noise] she was torturing them five destroying their reputation and destroying their name and basing it on either you're one of us or we're going to torture you until you become one\nYeah well exactly and uh we we see who has the stronger character Brett Kavanaugh under this withering relentless disowned from the left has remained true to we do we as\nAnd Jeff Flake like the pansy like Apache we know that he is folded like a cheap ... thank you for the call ... ... on that note\nLadies and gentlemen did you guys I don't watch Saturday Night live I found about this courtesy of Fox you guys catch Matt Damon unanswered now\nMatt Damon was mocking and ridiculing Brett Kavanaugh for being angry at his life being destroyed because Matt Damon has determined that Brett Kavanaugh needs to be destroyed the Democrats so and so many defends himself it this is open for mockery\nI I Want all of human and all of the women who have ... men in your life to push yourself put yourself in the place of Brett Kavanaugh and the righteous anger that we all saw come out last week in this hearing\nThat he demonstrated now listening to Matt Damon\nMake fun of it\nI'm going to start [laughter]\nYour\nCheck is kind of guy [noise]\nMonsters on this committee makes me want to hear\nFor them to get here Boston my farm where thousands beers along the way [noise]\nMy friend mark judge downright\nAngry now you have to wait till I get on the Supreme Court because then you're all going to pay\nAnd Fox pointed out the irony of this remember that Matt Damon was Harvey Weinstein's good buddy\nRemember Matt Damon cats Harvey Weinstein means sexual abuse secrets\nMatt Damon was talking about this and how he was accused himself member Matt Damon was accused of doing some in proper things\nAnd Matt Damon didn't take too kindly to being used as he said he was innocent\nThe day of the kind of um confidentiality agreements over\nI think it's just completely off the one that says I Can't say anything because if you ten years ago if you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out okay I have a hundred million dollar movie or I have a movie that I personally important to me coming out and\nA close and they relate to that film you say Matt Damon grab my butt and sucking falling down my throat [noise]\nWe would then go to mediation and and organize a settlement right I'd go I don't walk that's out there you know now with the Internet than you know with or not what the end up in the Internet wasn't there it's on your social media\nThe story yet just like bigger than sling port on its own moment of claims made yeah if you make that same claim today for me I Would I Would\nI Would be score I'd be scorched earth I go I don't care if it costs me ten million dollars to fight this in court with me for ten years and you're not taking money from me you are not taking my name and my reputation wins are hard working hard for it and and I earned it and you can't just blow me up like that\nOh so it's permissible for Matt Damon\nTo use his millions of dollars to go his words scorched earth and you can't falsely accused you can't blow me up like that it's okay for Matt Damon being a left wing extremists to go ahead and defend himself but he'll jump on Saturday Night live\nAnd mock another man who's had his life destroyed\nOn nothing but uncorroborated unconfirmed thirty six year old allegations and many are saying these allegations\nAre refuted because the foreign named witnesses body Kavanaugh accuser said I don't know what she's talking about this never happened\nSo that because Matt Damon doesn't want another conservative on the high court that deserves mockery but when Matt Damon is attacked for being for sexual impropriety\nOh he gets to get out there\nHe gets to get he gets to defend himself and not be mocked and he gets to go scorched earth\nWhat a hypocrite Hollywood hypocrites it's what they do and that's who they are\nTo weigh one five eight five seven three two one five I can see we'll get back we'll get more your phone calls and plus this discussion ... over the weekend about innocent until proven guilty\nHow many of you are willing to let that American concept go so many on the left are saying well it doesn't apply unless you're in a court of law really\nReally\nSo we can start accusing any left wing or we want to have everything that's out there just to destroy their lives and we must be believed because we are going to adopt the Democrats new standard of guilty until proven innocent how many of you were behind that\nThat's that's where the ... in politics that's where they that's that's all they care about these are the folks leading the charge\nAgainst Kavanaugh now they don't go on TV and admitted and they don't want to talk about it publicly they want to make this about everything else but this is all about abortion politics in roe versus Wade and they will destroy destroyed any person Kavanaugh\nAnybody and that's what people need to remember it wouldn't matter who Donald Trump nominated people say well if you've done this or that no it wouldn't matter because they would find a way to destroy anyone who threatens roe versus Wade if the whole ballgame\nYeah I I Hope you're right that this is and I made the observation last week to the Republican Party the never Trump urged the conservatives everybody's coming together because they see the travesty than to play here and it ought to Democrats oughta be Harold and they ought to be punished Scott Jennings anybody that\nYou mentioned brought up before I go you mentioned has option of innocence and due process\nIf we allow the underpinnings of the American justice system presumption of innocence and due process to be passed away here\nFor the good of modifying an angry mob God help us all God help us all because that is not a country that we have been for the last two hundred years and I'm telling ya we do not want to go down and it's a dangerous path\nYeah I think that Americans don't want to live in a country or the Democrats vision for this country thank you very much there's got Jennings he worked at President George W Bush's White House and alongside red Kevin uno seem to be a a man of good character gotten we'll talk again\nThank you very much sir a telephone number two one five I make my seventh react to a one five at a KFC get out of the phones I Know you guys are jumping in the bit to weigh in on this kind of stuff [noise] uh what am I ... hold on them and it\nIt is right there

Christian from ... ... ... ... all of those voters ... no\nI'd rather a shirt or a procedure of\nReally push for giving it on the FBI investigation\nBut the fact that he has said that all the investigations\nI'm Kevin chard ... and that the woman who trial hasn't even been considered she's the one who should be on a true\nWell I don't I don't I I have heard that they have not limited the scope of of not investigating a a mic Kavanaugh accuser I think that the FBI has been told to to to\nRectify these current allegations and do whatever they need to do to to get some clarity to the senators and that's and and all of the accuser their records are on on the line to\nFrench done are chosen wrote her name would be Jewish are suppose you're not at all connected with her\nI have no idea I have no idea nor do I care she and I I Am doing well with trying to hold on a whole month\nShe had her she had a spy you arriving I'd a Chinese Communist by driving her around for Nineteen years and McConnell\nDoing their you know a lot of change from Canada what is she joined ... we're stirring up the truth well now\nThat's a great that's a great question what is Mitch McConnell doing there I have I have no idea what he's doing their\n[noise] or or just ... Trump work in a\nRow apparently are there's just there's there's no real estate those or not this is trying to show up for this was a good man he's been ruined\nWell Mike I you you and I know that I think the president does that too but you got Collins you've got flake and you've got these individuals who are all too willing to give the Democrats to to to pacify the babies who are whining and crying and stopping because they don't want his nomination and\nThe it was put in for the president either you give this one week to give us political\nCover to vote or you lose the nomination\nThat's how the ... and the president made the practical decision I don't like it I don't like the fact that Jeff Flake did what he did and admitted on CBS that he would never dream of\nDoing it if he were

anything the Democrats and this is the Democrats have known that the cabinet accusers are all full of BS\nThey know it and they know the FBI is not going to find any of this stuff credible and by the way if I hear that term one more time to describe the cabin on cues are one or two or three none of us is credible you know why because they have no evidence\nAnd any evidence that they have provided has been refuted\n\nThe cabinet user number one said that for people who are at this so called party\nAt house I can't remember at a time I can't remember a year I Can't remember\nAnd all four of those people have said there was no gathering this never happened even one of the first accusers good friends\nSaid don't even know Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats know that this was all BS\nSo that's why they call for an FBI investigation they get the FBI investigation and now they're saying that it is not good enough as we should be able to try this out for years because folks what they want to do is to\nNot have Brett Kavanaugh on the high court that's the goal not the truth\nThe goal is to stop the nomination and they are this\nThe truth the goal is to stop the nomination they are

exploited this process\nAnd I think it's been totally to trade for I don't think anyone has hit the nail on the head better than Lindsey Graham get interesting Karen ... go along with us and that's a

hates Trump's so much that he is willing to let Brett Kavanaugh a good man on baseless accusations might my only hope as well to that\nIs that Jeff Flake any Democrats get a taste of their own medicine one day if there if there was poetic justice they will they will be accused wrongly and they will recognize the folly that is guilty until proven innocent\nAnd\nIt is my hope that the Jeff Flake loses everything that that Brett Kavanaugh has lost in the Dianne Feinstein loses everything that the Brett Kavanaugh's last based on false and uncorroborated and refuted accusations\nAre in the

little to do it when it got to go to\nStand up against the way out the staggering and they don't look at that party those to drop as to what is driving me around and saying that gives me quit\nIt in your life you know if you were asked every spring was they were eight me somebody and he well\nShe never she had to hide she never testified she got re she testified there was an attempt\nRight okay to which she wants and it's a shame it's me and say that the one person was soon\nMe and say that one person who may and\nNow she says she doesn't remember how she got home\nIt was you know the name of the ... took her and I'm like well once in a way to wait it out\nI don't want to get it and she ... she we don't know how she got home we don't know there was a car there you're s that's the whole thing there are so she remembers specifically an attack but she doesn't remember anything else surrounding it\nAnd right you know her best friend or one of her friends testified that that she doesn't even know and she was supposed to have been there she doesn't know Kavanaugh so many many people have of alleged that something did happen to the Kavanaugh accuser just wasn't Brett Kavanaugh but the Democrats were using this\nAnd ... and there is no evidence any of this is true but the Democrats are using this destroy all this nomination and that's exactly what that that's the plan\nWith the everyday and say is true this is all of the thing that I Will just put your shape for Kavanaugh said about what really happened to her\nAnd she was able to tell the story with us from feminism credibility which really to me it's to me than the story but I Hope everybody can see that [noise] they really want to get over\nWell I think he will get confirmed too and I think the majority of Americans see it and I think that ... there's there's so many stories out there trying to spin this the other way that the Republicans are concerned the real folks who are concerned is the backlash because nobody wants to live in the Democrats America Gary of guilty and they have an innocent\nThank you very much for the call buddy San Diego you're up Nashville come across ... or ... what's going on\nIs ... I'd like to present a theory right\n[laughter] I don't believe the alleged incidents ever took place I Believe this is an orchestrated um attempt by the left to derail the nomination\nAnd this was before volunteered to be the accuser and a ... you often talk about abortion\nBeing the religion of the left and and I think there are many arguments to that discussion and just like another religion has known men willing to go blow themselves up your destroy others\nIt's very plausible that this is an orchestrated attempt to find someone who was willing to be the accuser to make up these allegations and to go ruin him a\nYouth to ruin herself although I have a feeling that she's more of a cult he wrote now versus a victim\nUm but I think that this is a modern day left is a ... attack like get your in your\nI don't disagree or you know I think your your comparison is apt comparing the Democrats tactic to those of radicalized Islamic fundamentalist terrorist I think uh that ... percent apps into bombs and munitions and this is precisely what they're doing they denigrate they destroy\nThey they fabricated it's okay to lie\nIn the service of their religion and it has been established already on this program that the religion of the American left his government\nThat's what they worship or\nThink man I that that was a great call thank you very much for that on Sunday I go folks here on the course they'll say it'll show Fox News Sunday panel erupting into a debate on how the Democrats have treated\nThe Kavanaugh accuser allegations\nWere treated as credibly has a lot of people saying they were and I think that's why they would have I got about um the last cabinet treated well I think\nThis whole mess has documenting Scott my response to the question about how Christian months before it was pretty remember how to Oregon and she wrote a letter anonymously requesting anonymity to democratic congresswoman from California to pass them to to Dianne Feinstein did absolutely nothing with it now\nNow before he goes on he's about ready to get interrupted\nRemember for six weeks a\nFeinstein sat on this she could have called for the FBI to investigate back in July she didn't you know why because she was sitting on it folks she wanted to hold it because the whole idea wasn't to help\nChristine ... for the first Kavanaugh accuser the whole idea was to derail the nomination\nOf her requests Dr Manoj Jain and do not want to join a an anonymous you something a lot of sexual or not I am not going to find\nThis was what what happened was the matter was the matter was was not looked into by the committee confidence laid off weeks months past rice\nAnd that was me sometimes she was forced into the public eye and manipulated into the timeline for when the game on the job is emotional New Zealand [laughter] it's not fair to say that she was treated well by the dog\nRight now [laughter] I think ... he's right on here\nThe cabinet accuser\nWas outed by Democrats even though she claims and I don't know if the claim was true she claims that she wanted to remain anonymous [noise]\nTell me what good public figure would get an allegation like this and then sit on [noise]\nInstead of asking the FBI\nTo investigate she was no such thing as I said that she was not upon she said that she was not engaged in politics you felt very strongly wants her name was ... that she had an hour ago that I don't know who only\n[laughter] no no no no no no I Am\nSaying is I don't know who said I don't know where it came from Diane Feinstein Senate didn't come from her office and I take her on her wearing well that's your first mistake\nI think he's trying to protect students um oh senatorial career and honestly I haven't done enough research to know what are you going to do as\nWell he went to New Hampshire ... he was scheduled to speak in New Hampshire this weekend [noise]\nI mean okay that's nice but what if you're going to be doing for months a year to\n... or running for president he's running that that's why you go to New Hampshire\nYou run a resident\nYeah good luck [laughter]\nWell that's that's my that's my take and who knows if he's going to run as a Democrat or Republican thank you very much for the call Darryl I appreciated Lee you're up next welcome to the ...\nLouis or Jamie hello lean\nMy experience when I was like ten or eleven years old to the inappropriately found older\nAnd I will tell you right now I Know how I got there and I know how I got home and I know and I remember every brick every step I remember details you and not only and I find it hard to believe that someone will go through that experience and not\nRemember things of course not [laughter]\n... well well she she allegedly only had one beer I and and there's no way to corroborate that believe me ask you about your experience when you see uncorroborated\nAnd then according to four witnesses who the cabinet accuser said was there this event never even happened when you\nSee when you see\nThe politics of of sexual assault being used by the Democrats against what all evidence points to an innocent man you as a sufferer of an actual attack how do you feel about that\nWell I only now that Iran how my I'm Crying\n'cause I knew something wrong happens now one whether they're present my reaction was so strong that and I never lived my parents believe me\nI I I imagine that they are there are two sides to that I mean you have people who will accuse unjustly and those who will ah\nWell no I meant I mean I guess the one that may be more clear you as somebody who's actually suffered a real attack when you see by all indications of fake attack being used or as as a political fodder doesn't diminish actual sufferers of of sexual assault\n...
