intelligence agencies\nThrough I cutie that or a public venture fund funded by taxpayers that invested in these companies um\nThey invest early they have a large degree of control over what's happening and I'm Wondering should the taxpayer benefits when somebody like ... dot org which is the investment venture capital arm of the CIA that's their only customers yeah they invest in Facebook

voice from Texas [noise]\nWas former Congressman Joe Walsh back with you this Wednesday follow me on Twitter\nAt Walsh freedom were twenty days away again twenty days away from\nA really important mid term election I wanted to get kind of a view on what's going on out there especially with some of these Senate races happy to be joined by\nAlexandra deciding to she's with a National Review 'em\nA publication that everybody should check out everyday Alexandra thank you for joining me uh let me start broad work twenty days out right now I'm it appears that when it comes to the United States Senate there's momentum for Republicans yeah\nI think that's exactly right ... down to where we are and that was always the case I mean looking at the map of the year it was always favorable to Republican given are so many democratic incumbents out Cory election that Donald Trump won and try sixteen but I think you know even the momentum now it's clearly favoring Republicans perhaps even more overtime\nI'm intrigued Alexandra by a ... a couple of races I saw a debate a couple of nights ago in Arizona a mix Sally against Sinema um give me give me your thoughts on this race it appears to still be neck in neck\nI think so I and we haven't as far as I've seen there hasn't been a new poll in the last couple of days but I'm awaiting very early I frequent calling that rate over the last couple of days in particular it's really interesting stories that come out about a case that that amount of a Democrat\nIn the race um and she's yeah apparently had this pastor being intensely approach the Iraq War project thing our troops\nOut you know ... strange kind of even attacking her state thing that people in our down they're crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are are going to have some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema is doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask 'cause I Know Martha mix Sally and she's a strong military she's got a really strong record I guess I'm surprised at that race is close\nYou know I I started was as well but you have to think about you know the fact that Jeff Flake get their current and committed retiring at least in part a presumably because I'm certain that that certain type a Republican in regulating an estate anymore for some reason I think a big part of that it\nChanging demographics that you know on there that state which pretty clerk and twenty sixteen ear standard Republican voter there and I think perhaps that amount they sort of capture the messaging Florida and Arizona style and come across as a progressive than she actually is a ... ... people\nThat were a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in a state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to see him going out there but I Do think at the same time there have been some victories in something like border security across my credit in fact the motivating for a lot of Republicans do feel strongly about that issue\nOr maybe even want to yeah a wall get built it and people who again don't like Jeff Flake and then there could be Trump Republican so\nWhat a a ... I'm hopping Alexandra but it it just your your quick take on the house\nControl of the house um I I think the conventional wisdom still is the Democrats are the fever to assume control but that's no sure thing is it\nI don't think that's a sure thing and I kind of buy into that conventional wisdom for the most part but I Do think if you look at the enthusiasm gap obviously going into the midterm election first term president\nThe momentum would very much on the Democratic side and I think it still is but to me I think that the whole cabinet confirmation fight the extent that it's still on people's mind I think that at least has helped a little bit too narrow that you do the gap and get more public and\nA little bit more wrapped up and they might otherwise be especially if they're happy with that sort of President Trump status quo might be staying home I think you might see some more of those voters turning out and then maybe suburbs I'm In certain places that might end up shifting a couple of those races back to the ...\nI Know you call it feels like a lifetime ago already to Kevin winery and then I Know you\nCovered it extensively I mean we're twenty days away from an election in maybe this is a stupid question if it is I Apologize when most people go to the polls in twenty days are they still going to have the whole cabinet mess on their minds do think\nI think that's I think that's most important question right now honestly because it it's it's it is on their mind I think that'll be intensely motivating for Republican voters and to me it's lost about what those voters are thinking once they get to them or to your booth and much more about\nIs that if you're going to be important enough to drive them to the polls because again the status quo for Republicans right now probably happy with the economy and for the most part happy with the president out or at least the policies that we've gotten the last two years\nNot really feel or the impetus to get out and vote but in the states like Indiana Missouri North Dakota places where there are a democratic incumbent people who voted against a Brett Kavanaugh I think though that Republican voters might be thinking to themselves hey look I Know Trump's in office but I I don't want my democratic senator and there anymore I just as bad I got to be something ...\nThis this whole notion of this gender gap or there's this chasm between ... with women those opposed to to Trump and wanting to vote Democrat because they opposed Trump as as to those who support Republicans you choose the gap is pretty big why is that", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "18"}
