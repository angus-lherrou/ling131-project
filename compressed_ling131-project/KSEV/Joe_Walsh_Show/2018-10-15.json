this is this is what the media this is how they're trying to finesse and I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with him on a number of things that I always appreciate the discussion\nBut he had said and you know we went back and forth on this a little bit because I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he the President Trump is leading they hate movement against the press but it's not just against the press what stand out since out of his rallies and he'd quoting this pizza at the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is a too long the column of\nMy space and venting it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing isn't a ... to correctly capture their fields at the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to boy that took it back to the nineties in it and he said\nHe says that he's a recording that says well you know the president's leading hate moving against the press you know et cetera et cetera uh someone who watched his rallies on TV said oh they hate insensitive actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nAnd I wrote people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about science time and they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run or at a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do\nBut I said people chanting something at a rally is not comparable to stopping people in airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging part docks and families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both right and left do you think the leader of our country and helping to calm things down\n... well and that's when I said do you think that this began with this administration where are you purposely ignoring occupy Boston rioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump them would have Hillary and Booker and waters and holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for violent\nAnd I added further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left in the right I don't think Republicans have rights to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned when I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye was leaders would work to make things better not worse and said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that they are absolutely people on the left who have endured similar but how often how severe seems out measured\n[noise]\nYou know ... is [noise]\nI I I also hope it changes\nI mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides no it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bag hell yeah let's denounced that all day long I don't understand\nThe point look here's the thing you can sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got a Home Depot six wins this Sunday I don't care I Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of insect I'm totally fine with that go ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet speech you don't like it was more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who was um who\nWould who knew someone who knew the the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there [noise] um apparently and this was when I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counterprotesters and not even because they agreed with him but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you have somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like OK Jo Ann\n\nHow would that attributed\nOK so Ann\nHow would that attributed to Trump [noise] yeah and furthermore\nI Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency Cain or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever have condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa\nThey have refused to condemn the protest on college campuses where people ... people in the face and burned down buildings\nSo\nBefore you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people consistency\n...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps match it\nBut yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media to tell you that no\n\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed the KKK\nWould have a TV tours rally in Charlottesville\nIs anybody surprised at that don't believe may go Google at Washington Post read about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it if they'll condemn it lessen rightfully should be if they'll condemn it last because it was somebody of their own ideology that didn't that organize it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what does that give you to say the ... that you're saying well right does it give it when\n\nThis is this idea that\nUh\nSome I mean just I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and chatted on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw [noise] left is making a ... Bush and set on fire to\nAn your point what's your point\nYou want to do this you know fouls measuring what about them BS all day or even actually condemned the people that are shooting up congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidate you voted for\nOr how it is maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person that we voted for maybe you shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't say go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable\nRun them out of the country what about Booker or what about I mean I could go on and on what about antifa what about the stooges\nThat we're in Portland blocking traffic and beating up cars in ... in Haiti and old people\nWhere the hell are you at all any of these people going to get around to condemn and stuff are you gonna sit here and do well what about this thing here that will
