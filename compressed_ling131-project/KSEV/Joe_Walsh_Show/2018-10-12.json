this poll ah that I saw this morning Scott Walker down ten points a jolt to me\nI Am a huge Scott Walker fan I I think doggone it I didn't use one of the best Republican governors we got\nI'd love to see him president one day I Want to see him re elected I went back then and looked at the last eight to nine polls on that race that governor's race in Wisconsin and lo and behold Walker is down\nOn average ... down and all of them it's close it's not ten points buddies down\nAnd for those of you who do pay attention or should start a little bit 'cause I think most of us have figured out that that maybe you know Scott Walker's fine he'll get reelected in Wisconsin we don't have to worry about Walker\nPeter Scott Walker's fine he'll get reelected in Wisconsin we don't have to worry about Walker you know we got our governor race we got our election problems down here in Illinois and there are other Republican governors around the country who are in trouble but not Scott Walker well yeah Scott Walker is in trouble in fact he's down right now\n\nAnd I don't think it's because of anything bad Scott Walker's done right I think the reason Scott Walker is fighting for his political life right now has everything to do with what this political year is right now\nThat's all that's all\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred or give me a call let me go to a Greg Greg Iran with Joe\nHey how are ya I'm good man\nThe thing I don't understand is maybe the psychology of the Wisconsin border I Know things are better there and I know you do have a bunch of rabbit Democrats that are going to come out and vote against anything even if it's in their economic interests\nShouldn't shouldn't you know to do so yeah um but I or the ... it's just it's just the\nAverage Wisconsin voters apathetic adult safety that we've come a long way from where we were and\nWhere do you offer that shit I just I Know you know what a glaring psychology\nWhich you know it's interesting so my my answer to you would be your rights\nAre Wisconsin's doing pretty well right now Wisconsin's doing pretty damn well under Walker so to me when I look at this stuff and this is similar to other polls I've seen around the country even tells me it's got nothing to do with water now\nI Know you know what a great\nDay Gregg thanks I'm going to have me up you can listen to my answer it but you got about ten different things going on there it's got it's got nothing to do with Walker it has to do with the climate right now and we are in a climate right now that has one side extremely fired up\nLike I think I think these polls coming out of Wisconsin make clear that there are a lot of Democrats in Wisconsin who are getting a vote in November who don't ordinarily vote in midterms\nI Want to remind everybody typically more Republicans vote in the midterms than Democrats Democrats tend to come out in presidential elections but I think because the Trump right because the Trump Trump Trump is\nHe's he's fired up our side Andy fired up the opposition now the advantage the opposition has is they're angry this got nothing to do with Walker\nGot nothing to do with Walker it has everything to do with the climate we're in right now and that's the point I'm trying to make that is why to me this is a wake up call for Republicans and conservatives have email\nYes you're right about the climate\nIn this country um put their food I was reading I look at those polls are like you said you can't look at when you got to look at all of them together yeah and one this cute to the left or the other shoe to the right but you try to meld them together but the two things that they stand out are women with college degrees yeah you can go heavily democratic\nAnd the others for in this according to the recalls looking at\nThe big picture dad helped Trump was were cultural community\nBut with the terrorists now in China hurting and the Democrats are defending on the door with

B. Pritzker almost twenty ... head of him\nYeah you know Brian suffice to say we have our own unique issues and problems here in the state of Illinois that's why I wanted to put Scott Walker in front of

saying cop stand with our men and women in blue or California two days to go in ... they found Fifteen hundred more people\nWho were wrongly registered to vote that follows a twenty three thousand people\nIn early September that California said they found who were wrongly registered to vote\n'em we'll probably get some more next week and maybe the week after ... none of this is a surprise uh this is what happens when you allow the government to automatically register\nAnybody to vote who goes into a DMV and this is not a surprise when you are rich state when you're the government and you make it legal to give people in this country illegally government issued id\nI mean there are times I still pinch myself that we're doing this\nThat we're doing this in Illinois and California in states all over the country I mean it it it really throws you back on your haunt you think about that we are issuing we are giving government issued I D to people who are in our country illegally\nThat's that's that's really something let me go to Marie Marie [noise]\nOh well I'm a Republican it's not a break with you I really hate the target with with that comment the food to the point where are all of this craziness is accurate could put it as\nWe can catch I very much for many many years and they're much aware of this and I wish they could go back to the um\nActually we have here in Illinois or places but uh we used to it like in catches my eye out for the primary my house to house every precinct and a new term and the people that were register register or ticket or dress it they had\nAt one time ah yeah I don't know how I Lived for a um [noise]\nI Know yeah the voting and I'm quite sure how much risk taking today than it is really incredible that I'm not sure really ... got a long time and going back to California one going was a share\nTo California like going to share\nMurray thank you yeah no you're [laughter] I appreciate your perspective because that that sounds like so many years to go pay a re Iran with Joe Walsh Smith [noise]\nHey Joe I Love your show thank you brother they want to tell you you're a beacon of hope for us here in California behind enemy lines\n[laughter] where are you in California right\nI'm In San Diego something out\nThat it took a fire away [noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean I'm not against immigrants because I'm I'm a fan of an immigrant and yeah a navy veteran myself that long and my dad so we did it the right way so family to the right way yeah I came into the country if I'd reviews are brought in family members on them you know all legally\nAnd I take offense at all these other people that you know try to jump the border and get the same kind of benefits\nYeah yeah no spot on right thank you my friend and thank you for checking in from the state of California let me go to Mike Mike you're on with Joe Walsh\nJoe this this whole thing just so so disingenuous hypocritical Democrats are if you're America should have some fish so you shouldn't you don't need to have a photo ID do if you're an alien photo ID so they can vote [noise]\nThat's a good way to put me never I never thought of that go ahead\nI Can't believe a Democrats for being Democrats white get mad at spineless Republicans will put their foot down and put a stop to it [noise]\n... yeah Mike saying man or Republicans are generally afraid of this issue\nThey ship shoal around this issue um\nThey're afraid of losing the Hispanic vote the Latino vote so they really don't talk about it much uh I think that's bad politics I think I think it's a good issue and look the voter id issue here eighty\nPercent of the American people\nAnd white black and brown eighty percent of the American people think it just makes all of a sense in the world that you've you've got to show a photo ID or when you vote to show that you are who you say you are a rusty man you're on with Joe Walsh\nJoe how're you doing a good amount or the or the first time you grew up on the on the same thing I thought you\nKnow [laughter] I promise I read or write up [noise]\nYeah well I'll hang up and left me but very rarely do you have any power over to this and one for Democrats usually the case of this I Want to hear what your solution is rather than just to talk about him or what is your solution for\nCable stay on the line rush being I mean I'll give you the final word\nThis is a tricky one because and let's talk about California in general my solution would be\nTo reverse towards California did so I don't believe in motor voter a automatic registration I don't believe the state should automatically register\nAnybody to vote so that would be a solution I don't believe the state should give people in this country illegally driver's licenses so my solution Rushdie and I know what's that going to happen in California is I Would a reverse\nUh what California has done the last couple of years I'll give you the final word\nNuts that's fair enough I I have nothing else and that's where I was I got the idea of\nYour life but rusty ... and I admit you got me on this one because you and I know it's not going to happen\nUh it's not going to happen in California thank you brother thanks for checking in a ... it's it's a good question rusty what is my solution right and again my flip answer is the solution is don't do what California did don't do it Illinois did\n\nDon't make it easier much my solution don't make it easy for people to vote in this country don't make it easy for people to register to vote I'm not saying don't make it I don't want to make it difficult but don't make\nIt easy and and for heaven's sakes do not give anybody in this\nCountry illegally government issued id but that ah that that horse left the bar and a few years ago
