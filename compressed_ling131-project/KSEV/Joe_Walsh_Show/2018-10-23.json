fifty six hundred again my issue is this and it's really two fold\nIn public fine\nYour elected official right if I were still a congressman and I'm walking down the sidewalk or in the middle of a town in my district anybody's got a right to confront me\nTo ask me a question to get something off their chest\nThat's in public\nIf any constituent is any American sees me she's or season elected official in public they have a right absolutely they do to petition their government they got a right to say hey Jeff Flake or I think it's wrong that you supported Kavanaugh\nThey have a right to do that in public\nBut eating dinner in a restaurant like Mitch McConnell was\nThis weekend when he got harassed eating dinner with his wife now that's different that's a public if you're an elected official and you're sitting in a restaurant eating dinner with your wife ten people come into that a ... that that restaurant to confront you\nThat's not my definition of public\nThat's crossed the line you're not in public anymore you've crossed into a private space you're harassing people in that restaurant this weekend were harassing Mitch McConnell\n\nWhich say you want to mess three one two three four two fifty six hundred one other point I've got is the whole definition of confront you\nMean when I was in Congress I was very public member of Congress people coming up to me all the time I held town holds all the time people could get in my face people could poke me in the chest people could say whatever they want to say to me that's fine but what do you mean by confronting\nYou mean getting physical with an elected official pushing an elected official putting your hands on an elected\nOfficial well that's not right you don't have a right to do that\nI I think what we forget a lot is these elected officials yeah they got the answer to us and if they sign up to run right they got to put up with the heat and they got to put up with the American people we put them there they got to put up with such when they're in public getting in their face\nBut there are Americans as well and they've got rights and you don't have a right to push them you don't it if you see Mitch McConnell walking down the street you don't have a right to push him you don't have a right to put your hands on him [laughter] you don't have a right to obstruct him you don't have a right to get physical with him\nHe has rights to\nThis is an issue that we as a country need to think about because this is going to get worse when I saw David Jollies\nTweak this weekend I was bothered by it he uh it's really open ended he basically said game on we all have a right to confront elected officials in public\nIt depends upon what you mean by public\nEating dinner with your wife in a rush Ross\n[noise]\nTime to
