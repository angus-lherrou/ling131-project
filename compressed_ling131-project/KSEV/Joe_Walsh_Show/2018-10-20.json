by a reporter\nHe didn't like the question so that candidate for Congress picked up the reporter and body slammed him\nThrough him to the ground and then that candidate for Congress jumped on top of the reporter and started punching him\nIt doesn't matter I guess that at first the congressmen to be a denied that this happened until he was caught on tape the entire incident was caught on tape\nBut that now congressmen uh uh was arrested a he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge a instead of going to jail or he had to you know do community service anger management had to pay money to the reporter\nWho suffered injuries\nSo that happened a year ago\nAnd the president found himself in Montana last night at a rally\nAnd he got to talking about that incident last year the body slamming and he had the guy Greg gene forte he was in the audience right there and the president proceeded to praise what gene forte did she applauded\nPraise what gene forte did he applauded what gene forte did\nAnd the crowd loved it and the crowd loved it I I just think\nAnd I'm I'm actually curious the snow chill friday\nIs there anybody misty who's going to call me who thinks it's okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who has similar question 'cause if you don't watch if you don't think it's okay\nFor a congressman to physically\nAssault a reporter and by the way I think that's really important distinction you can laugh at people in the media you can knock them you can say hell ain't answering your question you can walk away you know whatever you want but to physically assault a reporter who asked the question\nIs if you if you don't believe that's okay\nWell then I don't know how you can approve of what the president of the United states did last night because last night the president of the United states approve\nWe love the ... gene forty did he applauded it he thought it was a great thing\nHe praised it said Jean forty my kind of guy hey Devon

the\nGreat thing great thing it was awesome what he did help GM forte when 'cause that's Montana in Montana they love it when you beat up members of the media great thing in the crowd went crazy\n\nSo many view rightly called into the show when Maxine Waters encourage people on the left to get in the face of\nMembers of Congress are people who worked for Trump is Trump's administration that's just horrible [noise] she's encouraging violence Joe that's terrible that's the mob that's like mob behavior\nOh here's the president United States encouraging physical violence praising physical violence

and then I'll ask you a question in my turning democratic God no I'm I've never been a Democrat in my life let me ask you a question then\nIs it okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter
