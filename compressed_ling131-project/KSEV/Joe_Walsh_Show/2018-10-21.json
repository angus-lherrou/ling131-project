who gave the Tony twelve Keno and that's one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to grind them watch it I said it years ago\nI've always had my I had my eye on them for years so I'm telling you and his brother's us rap Castro the former mayor and it was it that Antonio river walk that they switched him out I feel sort of my favorite one of my favorite stories on the politics and walking like argue with that we look\nAlike and people were going on and they were screaming at what they thought was really an Castro but he had gone to a\nFundraiser he ducked out he'd ghost it'll go scene if you put your identical twin and your place maybe not and then he put watching their to wave and everybody and act like he was a twin brother and then ... walking\nCastro said well they were out of me and I would go back to walk but that nobody believes that [noise]\n[noise] oh man\nWas there as its foreign policy analysis on a word that he they\nAre legit the they are the uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nAs who they are [noise] man\nSo that if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign and then you have this story or you have what make over ... he was spending in Iraq and\nDid you hear some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\nDo power line had a great\nA\nWrite up of this I think again it's not a whisper campaign you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there is German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or [noise] or this operative\nAnd that he was a because of its association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was recording via PJ Media that yeah and he was in his laments that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with modern Islamic totalitarian\nState and\nThat he was bitterly opposed to their approach to the state of Israel and he backed out he's back to Palestinian a transient intransigence which we know that kind of sitting can be treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven so we know that\nThat's not even up for debate that came I actually have the tweet said so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much cautioned being used and drawing conclusions about all of that because the intel establishment I just don't trust them of the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist [noise]\nSo I mean I don't know if they're as reading I don't know if that's off if but here's the thing if he was in the middle east operative line of world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\nIn New York Times this is what I'm powerless I noted the New York times said about could show the\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to end on official spokesman for the royal family and Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states she reinvented himself as a critic contributing college to the Washington Post and asks why would oppose enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself I contributing column\nIn New York Times describes him as a quote political Islamic to quilt for gay personal bond with President ... air to want to turkey why would the post to use as a columnist and Islamic pile of everyone\nAnd New York times also added that according to show that you don't friend he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending brother had meetings but acknowledge that he quote remains um conversant and conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric when she could deploy or high depending on who he was seeking to befriend enclosed\n\nThat was the New York times was saying that by the way that was it and I have the link I had the story right here it it ran just on the fourteenth\nSo that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that the New York times to their credit legit asking them questions or or putting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this guy\nI think it's a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince run a couple of columns by some duty didn't like it decided to kill him\nI mean let's look at this from another angle it's the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that hit the people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue I just really don't believe that they did\nAnd show why would you go to this drastic\nDrastic undertaking goals is links to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the game consulate just the he goes to the Saudi\nArabian constantly and turkey and gamble and what are your other who was always with you know the crown prince ... he goes in there shortly after\n\nThe brains ... now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he had gone on this charm offensive for the past several months I think that there is at some point he thinks that I\nDo think that too\nI think that there's at some point and he thinks that I think the I\nI Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo a particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugs it off but\nI think that after the charm offensive there's more than than just\nHe's you know punch drunk on power there's more to it than that because you don't go to this you don't go to this the fact that this links go all over the United states and you know show how you really do\nA unveiling reforms women are driving your rolling back\nSome of your your other regulations on you know said Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support\nThe uh the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world in that region that is huge so why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated just screw up like that was there a sense of urgency was there something else happening\nI mean that's what in the world led to that and I think that's a big question\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid because this was in New York Times that was saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood New York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they run a profile on me\nI actually like the reporter I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local nut job to try to do pieces on me and end up writing sand sick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay um but they're not even though they're biased and they make mistakes I don't think they're going to run something like that and unless it was the worst\nThat's it and then on the conservative publication so power\nThat that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign and I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying that there's something else happening here\nThat\nPeople are to their tribalism is getting in the way of asking the bigger questions why would the crown prince gamble all of everything and he had built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on Nick guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe in the New York times had written that he wasn't his longest here's if that see what the Muslim Brotherhood and he was apparently working to have and Islam is all set up a U.S air authoritarian state to replace the Saudi monarchy\nI mean is that what it was I think it's legitimate to act these types of questions and that's why it comes into play we're going to talk\nTo Dr ... about the next hour because this is his wheel house and I'm like I said I just think that there's there's something more there\nSo and then what happens if it turns out yeah that it would you know the Saturday did it and not only did they do over the crown prince apparently knew of it then then what happens often thoughts on that as well so we have all of that still to touch on a we will in the meantime Cal Tech is a\nOr into the

I'm not and then you'll learn not to ever stupid phone out maybe it'll teach a valuable lesson about manner I think it's a small price to pay for manners and we've got insurance on the phone so anyway I\nHad a conversation with my son who's in a ah my oldest son who is in a a forensic class in school and high school\nAnd so there were ... are no he's in his infringes need to take an economy that economic sorry and an economics class he said it's teacher mentioned the wage gap\nI tell my kids what to think but I Will tell them the truth and I said well that's a bunch of crap\nThat wage gap and he goes all I Know and he's got some friends in the class I think like he does and and he goes because you know if there was a wage gap than if I was running a company I Would just hire women and I'm like there you go and he goes because then I have a lot of money\nAnd like there you go so they they had this big thing while the conversation the other day was whether or not women not just should serve it should be in combat\nAnd I always think I'm I'm not big on women in combat\nLike I'm totally fine with supportive roles and totally find that you know pilots and you know doing everything else because I think that and we'll granted while I Do know some big BA women some women who are huge and could probably snap and do it in half their the exception not the rule\nAnd I don't think that you\nAre lower standards for entry into seals are entering the Marines or injury and anything else for ... for any reason at all whatsoever you\nDon't you don't make determinations based on the exception you make them based on the general\nRule and so I had a huge conversation with him and I said well maybe I'll let me tell you a story from one of my favorite films three hundred and let me tell you what ... what happened here because it's very\nUm a apropos to this conversation and I said so this was back during the uh hey Dave King land at us and the uh the the\nCity states Florida Florida was the warrior heart of Greece where I'd Athens was the intellectual center [noise] Marjah was the was the was the way they were the warriors that was the warriors state of Greek and so you had\nKing Leon ... who is getting ready to face off against ... and his his Persian army and we're taking three hundred of his warriors with him\nAnd there was a job at one point as they were making their way to that narrow past where they were planning on funneling the Persians through jerks he's army\nThere was at one point when he was he was resting and they were they had made they had made camp\nAnd there was one individual and I'm not saying that women are to form a I'm a woman there was there was one there was one guy one spartan who had followed them because back in the day if you know smart and had kids and they had anything wrong with them they would\nThey would kill them I mean that's just how it went and did this this um guys family had pity on him and they kept him and they raised him and he followed\nThe United States Army he followed the three hundred as they went out to go and and and a phage jerk seats and I forget what his name was on the phone\nBut anyway went out and he approached keenly not just because he was so fascinated with the strength of the spartan army and he was so impressed with just how hard core they were\nSo he went out and he begged keenly in Idaho letting me join your army let me fight for Florida let me fight\nAnd he was hunched over that's part of his deformity he had limited mobility with one of his arms he was a lot shorter because of his because of his a deformity than the than the other soldiers and Leon Ida asked him he goes to take your shield raise it up\nAnd he tried so hard he tried to raise it up and he just couldn't because of that limited mobility of his arm and Leon either explained to him\nMy army is only as strong as the weakest person in it\n\nAnd he says I Can't have you go and fight for Sparta and he said you know he could do is support really could do something like I Can't have it go and fight for ... and and this character got mad and went into trades\nThe first part of and and this character gotten mad and went and betrayed smarter to ...\nHis pride was wounded\nYou know what I told my son I said you know when it comes to the military one of the reasons the military is so successful is because it is discriminatory and he goes well I Can't say that I'm like you feel like you can't say it because you know that the nuances dead I'm not talking about race I'm not talking about sex\nDiscriminatory based on ability nothing else matters your sexual orientation is irrelevant no one cares no one cares what can you do it is an entire it's entirely a meritocracy what can you do\nAnd I said personally\nThe people that I wouldn't want it in the military or the people who don't understand that the people who think the standard should be lower so that they can enter the people who want to turn our fighting force into a social justice warrior experiment\nMilitary is about ... ... it is about sacrifice it is about servitude the last thing that the military has the military heroes room for selfish Jeanette\nAnd wanting to diminish the effectiveness of off fighting forced because of selfish and it's because you want to enlist to prove something that is not back or fight ... selflessness nor\nIs it servitude it'd selfish and\nThat's what it is\nYou know I Know you're going to put everyone else's life at risk for someone else can virtue signal\nAre you going to leave men out on the battlefield\nBecause someone doesn't have the strength to carry them back to camp\n\nThat's when you really have to ask the question is it in service to sell for in service to country\nAnd that's a conversation I had\nHim\nAnd I I go back and I look at all of this stuff people are mad because it said man is says man died you know we have the word mankind\n\nAnd that somebody says well it it promotes somehow gender inequality how does in the hell does that promote gender inequality I think by by overreacting you're doing more of a disservice to yourself than than anything else in your proving you were on equal and your ability\nTo not be constantly offended over everything and have to be sure of it because you're constantly offended over everything and the
