McDonald shooting in the ... the trial of officer Van Dyke\nThe jury's deliberating a verdict will come out any time the city is bracing itself for this verdict um they're our companies all over the city or who were sent lockdown\nOr safety instructions\nBecause again I'm telling you the way this has been set up and you know how these things work look just like the whole Brett Kavanaugh saying it should have nothing to do with the me too movement it should have nothing to do with\nUh all other women the only thing that the Brett Kavanaugh thing had to do with was didn't Brett Kavanaugh I'd do it did he do it it was about him and it was about Dr forged allegation this whole thing here I either a jury finds officer Van Dyke guilty of murder or they don't\nAnd we accept the verdict now you can protest till the cows come home but you know you know what's gonna happen if if for some reason officer Van Dyke is not found guilty of murder\nChicago's getting them moved well beyond protesting skin to move into dangerous territory rioting and looting and the like let me go to Jimmy hey Jenny\nAnd I'll take it one step further the studios every business owner at least a twenty four hour heads up the road rage and ask them to be announced at a specific time because we have to put our sisters that they don't get trash birds and looted now\nAny object it a step further and in short of first degree murder\nInvoluntary manslaughter set interest rates are going to be an excuse and the city does the citizens businesses or twenty\nIt was in the city does the citizens the businesses are twenty four hour ... when it's going to go there just drop it on anybody\nAnd Jimmy that's a great point and I apologize I hadn't thought of that and they really ought to do that I shouldn't say\nThat we've got to secure justice because they got sort of having their heads filled and you're on your own buddy yeah protect your own business is not messing around there's there's going to be desperadoes who just want to create advocates on him out there and the cops to protect you\nA Jimmy thank you great call you right actually ... you're you're you're spot on\nUm if if if first degree murder does not come back\nAh people are gonna go bananas in the city\nThere will be protesting there will be writing there will be looting there will be violence if first degree murder doesn't come back\nI I mean if officer Van Dyke gets off altogether lookout\nBut second degree involuntary manslaughter you write Jimmy right\nOr they they watch there are people who want this cat put away for life again I'm not at all discussing the substance of the case that's in the hands of a jury right\nThat we do I think officer Van Dyke is guilty of first degree murder I that's how my call that's how my call right now the way our system works a jury of his peers is making that determination but would always ... me\nIs there are people who will not accept\n\nThe justice but by the way that is justice whatever the jury decides whenever the jury dictates\nThat's how our justice system works that's an interesting notion though Jimmy of alerting the businesses given them twenty four hours because uh you're right Chicago police are going to have their hands full\nGotta protect your own let me go to Glen Glen\n[noise] Hey Joe ... um [noise]\nI um I I don't look at the gate for better or this thing
