who early on when someone who gave the twenty twelve keynote and that's one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to grant them watch it I said it years ago I've always had my I had my eye on them for years\nSo I'm telling you and his brother's us rat holding on cash or is the former\nMayor and it was at that CNN Tony a river walk that they switched him out I this is my favorite one of my favorite stories out of politics\nAnd walking like arguing or would that look like and people were going and they were screaming at what they thought was moving on Castro but he had gone to a fundraiser he dropped out he goes to them what is it goes scene if you put your identical twin and your place maybe not and then he put why came there to wave at everybody and act like he was his twin brother\nAnd then he hit ... walking Castro's they well they were yelling at me and I would go back you know it's a long chain for that nobody believes that [laughter]\n[laughter] oh man I would've\nWas there as a foreign policy analysis oh my word\nBut yeah that he they are legit the they are the uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nAs who they are [noise] man\nSo that's the thing if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign\nAnd then you have the story or you have what ... he was spending a death and\nThere's some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions do power line had a great\n... a rite of of this and I think that again it's not a whisper campaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there is German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or the operative\nAnd that he was a because of its association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in his laments that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islamic totalitarian state\nAnd that he was bitterly opposed to their approach to the state of Israel and he ... he backed Palestinian and trained in a intransigence which we know we backed Palestine because he treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nSo we know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually have the tweet saved so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much cautioned being used and drawing conclusions about all of this because the and tell us dabble Schmidt I just don't trust some of the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're ... and I don't know if that's off if but here's the thing if he was the middle east operative wind the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\n\nIn the New York times this is what I'm ... the New York times about could show the\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing columns to the Washington Post heroin asks why would oppose to enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself I contributing columns\nThe New York times describes him as a quote political Islamic to quote forged a personal bond with President ... ... of turkey why would the post a huge as a columnist and Islamic pal of ear to one\nAnd the New York times also added that according to the show again don't friends he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood\nThey said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledged that he quote remains um conversant in a conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that was saying that by the way that wasn't and I have the link either destroy right here it it ran just on the fourteenth so that is not conservative media carrying out a witch PR campaign that the New York\nTimes to their credit legit asking some questions or or putting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this guy\nAnd it gets a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince wrote a couple of columns by some duty to in life and decided to kill him\nI mean look look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue I've just really don't believe that they did\nAnd show why would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking and bills is lengths to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the dang consulate\nDistant did he goes to the Saudi Arabian constantly and turkey in general and then you know what are your other who's always with you know the crown prince ... he goes in there shortly after\nThat pretty worried that now you could say it's ...\n\nThat's pretty worried that now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on the charm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I think the I\nI I Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo a particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugs it off\nBut\nI think that after the charm offensive there's more than than just\nHe's you know punch drunk on power there's more to it than that because you don't go to this ... you don't go to this is the fact that this length go all over the United states and you know show how you're really getting a\nUnveiling reforms women are driving your rolling back some of your your other regulations on you know take Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support or the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world in that region that is huge\nSo why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like that was there a sense of urgency where's there's something else happening I mean that's one of the world led to that and I think that's a good question\n\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was in New York Times that we're saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood New York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud there are a profile of me I actually like the reporter I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local not jobs who tried to do pieces on me and end up writing than thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nUm but they're not even though there are biased and they make mistakes\nI don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was the worst that's it and they're not a conservative publication so power\nThat that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in the way of asking the bigger questions\nWhy would the crown prince gamble all of everything that he had built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe in the New York times had written that he was in his lawn it he was just that the what the Muslim Brotherhood and he was apparently working to have an Islamic I'll set up a affair authoritarian state to replace the Saudi monarchy\nI mean is that what it was\nI think it's legitimate to ask these types of questions\nAnd that's why it comes into play\nWe're going to talk to Dr ... jets are about the next hour because this is his wheel house and I'm like I said I just think that there there's something more there\nSo and then what happens if it turns out yeah that it was you know the Saudis did it and not only did they do over the crown prince apparently knew of it then then what happens most of the guys on that as well so we have all of that still to touch on a we will in the meantime Cal Tech is a great\nWife were conservatives find their
