eight years of Obama it's still down in the toilet right now\nSo it matters what the president says and when Donald Trump is down in Orlando today speaking in front of an audience of police chiefs and he says the following a Dev give me a number for\nPoliticians used read there's dangerous anti police estimate make life easier for criminals and more dangerous for\nLaw abiding citizens [noise] and
