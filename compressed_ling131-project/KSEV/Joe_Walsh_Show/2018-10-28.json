with this\n... the Trump stuff uh so interesting\nHuh I ... I don't know that would be very a very interesting\nSo I don't know maybe she goes I don't know if she goes back to Fox I lie for Fox I just think that she is a hard news person I think kc Kirk was jealous lover I got that I mean the level of critical thinking was a lot higher with Megan killer and and she's ...\nShe was just she just I think more quick witted but I think I think Kate Kirkland she was scheduled to provide their coverage through election coverage do for NBC I don't know\nIf she's going to do that I don't know if that's going to happen anymore but I um that NBC was they they were more than ... there were more than happy to like jump all over her and a cover it like oh here's because she had covered um do need to stop that NBC\nSo and for people to say she's made the show a toxic environment I have worked with her on Fox specials before I for people to say\nThat I'm Sorry but you all are liars everybody at Fox all her staff loved her her staff at Fox loved her the people at NBC that are trying to eat the stuff out\nThere jealous mean girls the boys too because that\nIs not true they're just trying to do whatever they can to pile on that militia and I dare say I don't know sounds defamatory\nBut that's not true\nThough she created a toxic work environment she's hard to work with no she wasn't\n\nI I've known are longer than these people and and I don't need to defend her I just hate when people lie because they're piling on I Can't stand that nonsense\nBut\nI'm at Fox the makeup artist loved her I Know all of I don't uh her producers one of her producers him still good friends with a or her old producer that was a thought her staff really liked her and here's something else that you're not going to\nThat you don't see and I'm going to tell you something about the industry conservative politics is very interesting people on ... and conservative politics are more cutthroat and they hate each other privately more southern progressive\nAll of the big it's ridiculous and as I saw from other women petty gossipy women stabbing each other and the back\nI have seen some grown women make fools of themselves and the conservative political sphere\nThey do it all back channel I could tell you names maybe one day I Will but some crazy stuff and some of the people who present themselves as the biggest Christian commentators some of them are some of the nastiest got that the people behind the scenes but then you have some really good women to\nSome really good men and women who are very genuine like Dana Perino I think is one of the most genuine people in the industry\nWhat you see what's her is what you get\n[noise] she is encouraging she is she is very inclusive she looks out for like when you when they bring in um you know like at town hall or if you know somebody else has a if they have\nNew people that are coming into the studio who are a little nervous about going on here for the first time she was always so nice to them and made them feel very welcome and I have to say it may again did a lot at Fox to promote women at that network\nAnd she would bring women from different parts of the political sphere onto that networking onto her show\nAlways I she had me on her show at least once a week she had other women on her show she made an effort to do that\nThere are other like there are other people you know Dana Perino make an effort to do that people like Kennedy people there are some really and and for\nPeople to say that she somehow causes like a a a toxic environment I just don't I've never seen that everybody men and women\nAppreciated her work ethic and they thought she was easy to work with and they appreciate her that she valued what everybody brought to the table\nWhether you'd be a gaffe or or whether you be an associate producer didn't matter and it's very easy to get away from that because I have seen really nasty people you know I just and and and it it said that I saw that headline and I'm like are you\nKidding me are you for real come on\nSo I I don't know I that aggravates me I think that there's I think NBC had it out from the very beginning and now like one of my friends said they got a problem with family with women how she did it end curry you know one of the biggest mean girls was Matt Lauer oh my gosh\nMatt Lauer Superman girl Superbad mean girl\nWell\nYeah they

to Larry I start talking about going there and the cable guy like that and he is not happy about that that upset him\nBut also\nThere is something there that ... I think shows whether or not someone was actually\nA fan or not and we'll talk about that when we come back\nBecause I think there's that this goes into your look at you over there not unlike it supports my theory like if you're like in my mind at all from totally supports my theory of even the ... oh my gosh we're going to I think we might have to remind people if you're a theory [noise] anyway so we'll we'll ... sat in the meantime\nIt is what's today's date twenty cents of October ... oh my gosh\nThat's insane eleven eleven pie cancelled I feel like I just got I feel like I was just on the beach for summer vacation and now it's already the end of October which means right after Halloween happen\nOn his Thanksgiving and then put them at Christmas so it's a little nuts\nAnd you need your you need it you need energy I Need a daily does a superb leads to keep energy levels up because ah with and I think the weather change has a lot to do with it\nA lot to do with it so if you need extra energy daily just do not reach for these goofy energy drinks or coffee or sugar empty calories high caloric sugary drinks all of that stuff don't\nYou need to try super be there's only four ounces of water for crying out loud\nIt harder to the power of nutrient rich and the and it it it blah blah blah it's the powder but it's especially grown on ... and they condense them down to ... with the whole process 'cause if you cook at home you're destroying the nitrate nitrates constructed body production of nitric oxide\nThat's an increase in your circulation and maintain the blood pressure and that ladies and gentlemen and how you get your energy you can get a natural energy with no jitters and know crash not that bad stuff that's associated with stimulant\nUh and it's real healthy natural energy mild Barry flavor earthy Barry flavor or you can get it in a black cherry they cherry juice all natural\n... if you'd like cherry that's totally or damp I'm like I like cherry pie but I Can't know so I just did the ... or the various labor collate hundreds except for fifty six Seventeen visit Dana's needs dot com the heightened get a free thirty days applies to beat them for shipping with your first order eight hundred six six four fifty six Seventeen Dana beats dot com\n\nIn combat service members count on their brothers to have their back when they returned home to face the emotional medical and financial challenges and being a veteran who has their back then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "28"}
