it was right there in our face\nAnd come on now you know you were into what I was into it and you were into it every single day you can turn on this radio show you'd want to know what's going on what shall we say about what happened today and you know mostly you were glued to that hearing on Thursday\nDon't do that this week you see I think that ship sailed\nThis week you see I think that ship sailed ... there there's\nNo there's nothing more than any Republican or Democrat can say that will matter\n\nAnything at this point that any Republican and Democrat says is a hundred and ten percent political and in Andy's not truthful\n\nAnd the biggest deal this week the only issue this week the the reason that we have this week is because of the FBI investigation and you and me and everybody around us we don't know what the FBI is\nDoing we shouldn't know what the FBI is doing\nLet it play out I Know many didn't want to play out let it play out I Hope that it plays out and I hope that it it's simply reaffirms what a wonderful pick that Brett Kavanaugh yes\nBut no a handle this week differently go by your lives and let's wait let's wait to see what the FBI does and stay away\nFrom all of the twins are rumors and the Facebook rumors and the Fox news or the CNN rumors none of them know\nTrump spoke to it today a again he was kinda all over the map give me ... number three\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time [noise]\nJust so we all understand\nDishes or seven\nOf a man\nWho has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a chain she's gone through what his family's gone through to me for deaf\nI Won the FBI this is now they're sevens investigation so it's not like you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigations whatever\nMeans according to\nThe senators\nHe wants a comprehensive investigation but then Trump said this number five\nWas that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I like to go quickly very simple so simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nSo you figure you\nFigure where we're at let me go to Jeff Jeff\nHow are you doing I'm you know what I'm going to start a hash tag had to leave it called can trash bags by ten trash bags that my perjured attend\nDemocrats slandered judge Kavanaugh last week the point here with the FBI and let it was the FBI whether it seven days or seven years they're not going to be happy with it like I Try to overturn it\nFor a new investigation motor investigated ... matter what happened there to say no that's a good enough to go out all games let's have a vote and be done\nOr thanks Jeff let's not get worked up about it this week that's my vice let me go to Eddie hey at a year on with Joe Walsh\nJoe thanks for taking my call I Would give you I tried to get in on friday and wasn't able to get through or the fact that they've allowed to go another step\nIs just so just to point um I I I think we're going to do this I think it's going to go through this week but I don't think Kavanaugh it's going to be confirmed everybody had made their mind up already this is all just a big\nShow and such but I I completely agree with you I'm staying out of it I'm not thrown in industry but it's going to be so sad 'cause I really believe he's not going to get in time\nAnd it's just a shame and I I watch what our senator from Illinois to that man yeah and and I want to move out of the state I'm so disgusted by Senator Durbin and it was appalling appalling what he did\nAnd you have any I agree don't move out of Illinois because the Durban do move out of Illinois because of the taxes that's much better reason look don't I I I agree with that though everybody um don't let this week the last week there's nothing more that we can do\nAnd as far as the Democrats go guys\nThey don't matter here please know that I Want to say this again\nThe FBI's gotta week this week and they're going to come back and it's gonna we're either going to be where we were at the end of last week they're just going to confirm what the Senate told us\nOr there might be something new and if we're where we are at the end of last week all the Republicans are going to vote for Kavanaugh we do not need a Democrat vote\nFor Democrats\nNo longer matter in this process if the FBI just confirms what we know we don't need them if the FBI finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lion as I said\nAnd I hope and pray that that's not going to be the case but if we find out he's been line he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court anyway so the Democrats don't matter I'm Jewell wants to go anywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nTime to check them much freedom voicemail with you're saying about Joe [noise]\nJoe off over

all of NAFTA intact\nThat's an important point to make just so you're smart Donald Trump called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever okay what Trump signed today or agreed to today keeps almost all of that worst trade deal ever in\nTact\nShot again I I don't know how you how you get there but it it'll work\nWith a lot of people look at the great deals she makes a quick look I'm again as John mentioned\nAh right now uh sixty two point five percent of every auto all auto components are built in North America must be from North America it bumps that up to Seventy five percent understand as well that's going to make it more expensive to make cars here\nOr in the United states of America\nUh let's see what else he keeps intact\nUm what Canada wine and which is how to resolve disputes it opens up a limited a Canadian dairy markets to United States farmers\nUm and then there are like just two or three other real minor little provisions and it changes the name\nSo it's no longer called NAFTA not what's called the United states Mexico Canada agreement but its NAFTA [noise]\nLet me go to our hey are you around with Joe\n... orders for ... for the arc right there where a Mr Kim I'm I'm
