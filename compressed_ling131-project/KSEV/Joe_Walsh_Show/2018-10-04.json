Senate rules that would set up a vote or in the United States Senate on friday to end all debate I'm Brett Kavanaugh\n\nAnd then again just for Senate rules than they gotta wait I Believe three days then to actually have the vote\nTo confirm Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWhich means Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed by first thing next week\nAgain we're not there yet and [laughter]\nI don't know if you're

this afternoon as we get details we will get them to you\nJust show I and I know if if it sounds like I'm a tad all teen right now it's because I'm a tad halting right dodge try and bring it up to speed um it looks like this thing at least the FBI investigation part of this thing has come to an end\nOf the Republicans the Senate Republicans privately and uh they said publicly as well they expect to get their hands on the FBI report today tonight uh before this day is done now I'm sure you know if that's the case\nIf the Senate and gets a hold of the FBI report today this supplemental report today that means they would be able to schedule a vote for friday\nWhich would and this is the first vote per Senate rules or a ... the cloture vote which means the vote to end all debate on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that vote than columns and then they proceed to have them vote on the nomination\nAnd that vote will probably now looks like it may well happen sometime over the weekend first thing next week at the absolute latest now the copy out to all this and there's been right ... it's all [laughter]\nNot a copy out to all of this and there's been right ... it's all [laughter]\nEvery single day right to all of this\nWe don't know what's in the FBI report Democrats are angry Democrats are angry because the FBI report only took three days maybe four days\nOr the Democrats don't believe this is a legit FBI report but that doesn't matter\nOkay ... as we said last week the Democrats bagged for an FBI investigation\nOkay the Republicans gave them an FBI investigation to last no more than a week it did not last week the Democrats will have nothing else to cry or complain about\nThen it comes down to what specifically is in the report\nThe obligation here is on the United States Senate to make the vote this is their job this is their constitutional duty should they will look at the report\nAnd ...\nFor the umpteenth time it's not like the FBI in the report is going to say uh we believe Brett Kavanaugh's line or we believe Dr Ford's line the FBI is just going to say this is what mark judge said this is what this guy named PJ said this is what this woman named ... said you\nAll decide you all decide [noise]\nAnd then it's up to the senators to do what do senators have been called to do come on now vote ... for next\n\nSo unless there's troubling information right and don't believe anything that's being leaked right now by the Democrats or the Republicans people have been leaking all we don't believe anything that's been linked to wait till this report comes out\nYou we don't know what that you know they met with Martin judge who allegedly was the the other guy in the room um\nThe FBI met with him and questioned him for a long long time supposedly don't read anything into that but here's the deal we don't know what mark judge set\n\nSo this is all contingent upon what is in the report with a report faze\nUs seems to be over\nHey Steve in Iran

this woman can't remember I I I hear you had to let the networks sweat and beyond Trump's side anyway but let me ask you to the people we don't even need to\nLive in and day by preacher your opinion

Nations court this morning get this border the U.S to suspend certain sanctions against Iraq a ruling that Iran hailed as a big old victory\nBut thankfully a ruling that the Trump Administration said they were not bound by the uh the ruling by the into the UN's\nInternational court of justice in theory\nCould complicate our effort to\nUp the economic pressure on Iran or above what we're going to ignore it or we're going to ignore what this United Nations court said isn't that something like the un court the international court of justice telling us\nWhat we can and cannot do isn't that something like the United nations ordering I understand this is a un court today that ordered the United states to suspend certain sanctions against Iran\n\nShow you know the international court of justice or which rules on disputes between you and members it's got no power to enforce this decision\nIt's pretty huge lists like the United nations is pretty useless and our secretary of state Mike

the Nineteen Seventy nine or raining revolution\nA but this but the Trump Administration announced today that they're pulling out of the Nineteen fifty five agreement with Iran to maintain economic

nations is ordering not to do anything get lost\nThey can't order us to do anything worse sovereign nation we are the ones who decide what we do we're the ones who decide what we do to keep our country is safe to make our country prospered we our the boss and watch the United nations can't tell us what to do\nAnd how refreshing to wash\nThat the Trump Administration might pump ale waited
