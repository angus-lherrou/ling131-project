before she has early voting I don't like it do you I don't mean to offend anybody who's voted early or who's going to vote early a God Bless you I Want everybody voting I I I I Will just say one more time and then I'll turn it over to you\nI'm don't misunderstand me [laughter]\nYeah right like that's going to work I think we make it too easy for people to register to vote in this country and I think we make it too easy for people to vote I you know what I think people got to have some skin again I think people got to show a little bit of damn effort to go vote to get themselves registered to vote and then devote\nI fear I worry I Dream I got a dream that we're going to get to a point in this country where you don't have to leave your house on election day people are going to show up at your door with a ballot with a pizza with some Coca Cola or some beer you don't have to get off of your couch and you'll be able to vote we make it\nSo damn easy but I just think we're diminishing the importance of election day all of this early voting and we're making it earlier and earlier and earlier the game's not over the debates not over the campaign isn't over\nHow about we all wait till election day let me go to my friend your friend Sean from ...\nDo I would I got in the car was listening to talk and I and I kept waiting for you to say it this is for the infrastructure of corruption within about cities\nIn each city could care less about citizen you got to remember this government is the largest employer it's the largest creditor the largest debtor there's a lot of people go regents that government\nAnd they need time to get out and and not only that you have to workers\nYou know what Chicago's like that's the only time these guys still works they gotta get all the people out driving my car was like oh over for the for the end result and they tell them which is to push it just to sustain it to grow the corruption within government so you're motivating\nWho exactly fair motivating the people that have something to gauge so that's why I think it's over it's for me to me\nIt's the few of us that it listen to the judge shows like the Joe Walsh show that it involves getting older the issue is the others are voting for their own increases their own pockets\nYeah hey Sean great stuff man thank you and thank you for a ... a sitting in this chair last week yeah early voting is just another way to make it easier and easier for people to vote who have really a\n[laughter] who got no skin in the game but as John said they they they need to be taken\nIshaan said they they they need to be taken care of let me go to a Laura Laura you're on with Joe\nHi Joe how are you I'm good [noise] [noise]\nWell I have to say that I thought I was on the radio and you had a nails boy I Wish I Would like you said because those are the things I've been saying for years\nOut and people are lazy they want everything handed to them there's no work ethic there was no effort to do anything and the corruption oh my goodness I mean you can you can register on line to vote and yet they all are complaining about voter ID laws because you'll get a call [noise]\nYup sickening it's actually in Illinois is corrupt that country and\nYou know water you know what you find like an old fart like me\nI Am a privately owned wind shadow lonely and I'm only ... I Love I Love how [laughter]\nI Love it Laura I Love it thank you let me go to Mary Mary you're on with Joe Walsh\nHey Charles how are you doing I'm good my dear and Laura yep I agree with those folks in the minds when it comes to this early voting I don't agree with that I've never done yet and\nI always hear like they said there's corruption behind and one thing I'd like to know why should they count the phones aren't that many counting than when\nThere are no no no no\nThey're not supposed to be I Believe I could have this wrong I Believe they are the first votes counted or when the polls closed on election night that's the way it's supposed\nTo be looked at as well [laughter]\nYeah I Know I certainly don't nobody's looking at them because I really don't feel comfortable with that and it adds to watch more I said earlier I as to how easily corrupted you know some low John ...\nYou know could be and and yeah I bet you I'm an old or to go to\nMary thank you God Bless you think you appreciate it let me go to another Joe Hey Joe\nHey Joe how are you\nI'm good man\nOkay well I I was with you a couple of years ago and I agree with you know I wasn't for early voting\n\nOff my car lost their driver's license broke my arm and um and the other thing and then move from where I was to this area I go I was from in Springfield arming the quad cities yeah I went out of Springfield, Illinois and the clerk's office they said no you're not registered here\nSo I had to go up to the rock island county clerks hours\nAnd then they said well you can you can change your registration what you ask a vote today\nOtherwise you wouldn't get your voter registration and ...\nAnd ... and then I I'm On your side I remember I'm voting for the same people who you are a and generally speaking of the of our ruined it yet but again I think there are reasons to be out there\nBut I Do think right after Labor Day is ridiculous I think two weeks out I wouldn't do it you should be able to be able to find a way to get votes\nHey Joel thanks appreciate appreciate your thoughts are it's an interesting question and by the way the country is moving in one direction or more and more early voting and earlier and earlier ...\nA ... that's that's where we're headed I don't like it I I don't like a lot of of how we do campaigns and elections in this country I don't like that we automatically register people to vote that's a bunch of bull but that's\nThat's the world we live in now all of this stuff I don't like it I guess I'm an old\n[noise]\nTrying to track the voicemail when John Wayne
