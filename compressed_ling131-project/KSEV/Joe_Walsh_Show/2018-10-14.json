this is how they're trying to finesse and I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with them on a number of things that I always appreciate the discussion\nBut he had said and\nKnow we went back and forth on this a little bit because I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he said President Trump is leading a hate movement against the press but it's not just against the press what stand up stands out of his rallies and he's quoting this piece of the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is a too long the column of my space vending it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing isn't a ... to correctly capture their fields at the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to avoid it took it back to the nineties in it and he said\nHe says that he's a recording that says well you know the president's leading the hate movement against the press you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watches rallies on TV said oh they hate insensitive actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nArab people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up saying when they were talking about science time and they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run or out of a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do\nBut I said people chanting something at a rally in not comparable to stopping people in airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging card dachshund families and shooting up a congressional ball game that column is just plain silly he\nSays well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both are right in the left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down\n... well and that's when I said do you think that this began with its administration where are you purposely ignoring occupy bussed in rioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump them would have Hillary Booker and waters and holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for violent\nAnd I added further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left in the right I don't think Republicans should rights to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned what I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye which leaders would work to make things better not words and said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that there absolutely people on the left who have endured similar but how often and how severe seems out measured\n[noise]\nYou know ... this is is [noise]\nI I\nI also hope it changes\nI mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides no it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bad hell yeah let's denounced that all day long I don't understand\nThe point look here's the thing you can sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got a Home Depot six wins the Sunday I don't care I Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of insects I'm totally fine with that go ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet speech you don't like it was more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who is um who\nWas who knew someone who knew the the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there [noise] um apparently and this is what I was told by this individual who lived actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counterprotesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you have somebody driving the car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so Ann\nHow would that attributed to Trump\n\nHow would that attributed to Trump [noise] yeah and furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever have condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa\nThey have refused to condemn the protests on college campuses where people ... people in the face and burned down buildings\nSo\nBefore you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people's consistency ...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps match it\nBut yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media tell you that no\n\nIf anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed or the KKK would have a tiki torches rally in Charlottesville is anybody surprised at that don't believe me go Google at Washington Post wrote about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it if they'll condemn it lasts and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it last because it was somebody of their own ideology that did it that organize it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what does that give you to say the stuff that you're saying well right does it give it when this is this idea that\nUh\nSome I mean just I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and set it on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw left is to make an effigy of Bush and set out on fire too\nAnd your point what's your point\nYou want to do this you know south measuring what about his M. B. S. all day or you can actually condemn the people that are shooting up congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidate you voted for\nOr how it is maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person that we voted for maybe you shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't said go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable\nRun them out of the country what about Booker or what about I mean I could go on and on what about antifa\nWhat about the stooges that we're in Portland blocking traffic and beating up cars in ... in Haiti and old people\nWonder how are you got any of these people going to get around to condemn and that stuff are you going to hear new well what about this thing here that ... that conservative that one person did a conservative jumped on and they describe why the living hell what about that\nWhat

Russ Carnahan town hall and I think this was it was an oval or Melville in St Louis to St Louis county and uh they bust and a bunch of agitator\nAnd job busted in all these people and they were very hostile Carnahan people I watched as they screamed at in the face and I took video of it\nThat guy this a younger guy screened uh right by the side of the face of this old guy who was wearing a World War two veteran hats [noise]\nNo I don't believe me go you all go on the Internet and you look it up there's photos and video that exists they were absolutely jak wagons ignorant people that were looking for a fight and meanwhile the tea partiers that were they were very calm cool and collected and everyone waited in line you know they listen to what specifically on health care and I remember seeing\nYou know I'm I'm a I'm a black man I'm Out front\nWho was selling Tea Party merchandise and I saw him before it a number of different things and it's I just I it was because I had seen him so much but what struck out to me and I'm the reason I bring up his skin colors because that matters to progress as an because it factors into what happened to him [noise] ah\nThe I saw him previously at an event where tea partiers were protesting bronco bomb and he was selling Obama merchandise even the capitalist\nHe would just sell the merchandise to the the ... the biggest script that he would he thought was going to show up\nThat's what he would pack up and sell right so I've seen him at Obama events previously selling Obama buttons and Obama shirts and Obama hats and Obama cups et cetera well this on his own Tea Party stuff Tea Party like the beads go ah ah flags and hats and shirts and all that\nAnd it seems kind of planning\nAnd um and I had a ... I had a hit with Greta Van Susteren it was one of my very first Fox it ever and I was leaving the town hall and my husband and I were walking through the parking lot and I heard all hell breaks loose behind me [noise]\nAnd I turned around and that's right when I saw one of the dude who they're with Carnahan take glad need to the ground [noise]\nThey were yelling racial slurs because they thought he is a black man was a conservative I was there and I thought and there were a lot of progressive that we're trying to spin the crap and I will I Will get righteously indignant with you until you just said to hell down 'cause I was there and I saw it with my own damn eyes\nDon't you man when his ... to me liars I was there and I saw it with my own eyes and I'd never seen anything like that I was very nervous inside the gymnasium they turned off the air conditioning they shut all the doors purposely I think to make it hot I honestly think to this day that they were trying to make something happen there\nUm and there are people were so overly aggressive it was almost like it was on purpose in theatrical like they really wanted to start something I'm I've never seen anything like that that was my first experience with that and I turned around and I had never seen violence at a political event and I watch the discussion\nAnd I turned around and I had never seen violence at a political event and I watch the discussion Glenn needed a ground watched as he he they've tumbled he kicked them um and then everyone started running over and my husband was like this is going to get out of hand fast we ... we need to move because we had to go all the way back downtown for hit\nAnd I was I'm On the phone with Greta producers at the time one of her producers hated me so bad and she she banned me from coming on her show one of her producers is really mean um because she found out another producer had\nAsked anyway um but she's so I\nCalled her producers ... on my way either and I was like all holdings broke out at this\n... at this event at this ... at the Carnahan of it and I was telling them and that's how the news broke I've broken on credit show and we ended up getting her video and all of that stuff and it was the first thing that I'd ever seen that was that those were the people who were angry\nFor all these comparisons and there was a piece in the Washington Post about that they were trying to compare people and the Tea Party to the mob it is that the just offensive absolutely false ridiculous accusation\nIt is a lie I watched a woman on Fox last night when her to take that be a story that James cleaver tried to push for you and he said back in two thousand and ten and tea partiers were rallying outside of the capital and they were allowed and they had their signed it was nothing like what you saw but the Supreme Court business but\n... he tried to say against their will cleaver he was he tried to start at a tea partier spit on him and Manuel cleaver said that if somebody had that on him except there were thousands of cameras there are\nTons of angles and all of those cameras proved him wrong\nMy late friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart even offered I think it was like a ten thousand dollar reward for approve of it and what was even crazier Jesse Jackson junior was walking right behind cleaver recording it on his phone recording everything on his phone and he everybody demanded he released his footage and he outright refused\n[noise] and then all the other individuals that were there that had that were right there when it happened everybody had found that there are multiple angles there was a video of all the different angles put out showed it absolutely never happened\nBecause he said oh what happened right here on the video footage showed ... ever happened daylight and I saw that\nThis I don't know who the hell did this debt was on Fox last night she wasn't there she knows nothing about it she was just regurgitate in false crap like it never ever happen but this is how they do it they just repeated over and over again until they believe it themselves with the hope that you'll believe it as they do\nNever happen that would they were never a mob and the photos and everything that I took it at first McCaskill event I actually used and turned it into a photo essay after tea partiers were accused of being a mob they were there and they were demonstrating for for principled reasons", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "14"}
