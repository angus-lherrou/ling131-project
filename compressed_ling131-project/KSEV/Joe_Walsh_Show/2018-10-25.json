I Can't believe a lot of things like you do I think it's going to get worse before it gets better but I mean we don't have her head we're all in trouble\n[noise] I'm Greg good call agree the problem is here's the problem this country is so much more divided than we all know\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred who's to blame you've got everybody on the left blaming President Trump for what happened today\nI just I just don't buy that one I owed let me go to a Tony hate Tony around with Joe\nAnd Joe you know my first instinct this morning was you know I wanted to jump on the bandwagon of false flag and all that but then thinking it through in order to do that you have to assume the motives of this individual your last caller had it right I think it will get worse and here's the thing I Do think that Trump\nGot um whether I agree with him or not I think you can put some blame on that the same that you can quickly and my Maxine Waters and things that she goes and assuming the motives of others and then acting on that is a tactic of electric generally what you ... you know you can\nSay you see that on that side um for example\n... you know you can say you see that on that side\nUm if for example a identity politics\nIn order to claim something as hate speech or or to say that you know why criminal justice or anything along those lines you have to assume the motives of that individual before ... and that you know we didn't want to make any assumptions before the extra for cabinet and I think we should make any substance\nI'm Tony ... play this out for me I I'm trying to understand what you're saying 'cause it's interesting so if if if you've got Trump up there ... month after month called the media the enemy and the people\nAnd then some madman grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media because she can't stand the media 'cause they're the enemy that people are ... Donald Trump have any blame for what that Mad Men did\nWell I'm sure the argument could be made that is to blame but the point is you know when you play it out you know what your last caller said is exactly right that's what the ... the the justice system is there for is to work on it came out and quicker and take it down to the level of the individual\nYou know rhetoric is rhetoric and if people can handle it you shouldn't get involved\nIn a good call Tony no in in your right next thing comes right there when you look you know I you know shift from the beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the meeting the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you've got Trump author call on the media the enemy and the people and then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media\nUm the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media\nHe's responsible for that and he's going to pay a price for that there's a big difference between Donald Trump saying the media is the enemy the people or Donald Trump saying hey come on everybody grab you go shoot a member of the media\nIf Donald Trump said that at one of his rallies everybody needs to go shoot a member of everybody needs to go shoot somebody at CNN and then somebody shot somebody if CNN I guarantee you Donald Trump would be held liable for\nThat as well but there's a big difference between expressing an opinion the media is the enemy the people or the media sucks\nAnd the president saying go go attack a member of the media there's a big big difference between that let me go to Dave Dave you're on the Joe\n... Joe [noise] um I just got or heard about this on my way and work for the first time but it's funny that none of these bombs were off I mean\nYou know how to measure that make you think that all of them or something would have went off the well they do the Democrats and the media that cause a lot of the problems you know I'm sure Trump truckers angry\nYou know but I'm everything goes through or two years ago or a little longer I don't blame him on\nA day thanks um\nThis she ended up the bomb that was at CNN it was reported to be a a live device it did not go off it could have gone off um the other devices\nIs the one guy to George Soros his residence\nOr the again the the the one the Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Brock Obama me\nYou know they they don't bronco bomb and doesn't go out and get his mail every day that they they they go somewhere else where they're screened a first and that's where these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on\nThat point um look we\nLive in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now um and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\nAll violence on July ...\n[noise]\nTime to check the freedom of voicemail when you're sitting in my job [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSure why I'm\nTrying to talk people end up coming to your little cookout to go out in the hand out ... and stuff to get the Republicans get people to vote for the Republicans in Illinois where do you do that\nBecause every time you open your big mouth criticizing Trump undermining Trump all you're doing is undermining all the other people running for office that are Republicans the churches too stupid to understand that you just give bullet after bullet\nTo the Democrats it's no wonder you're not in Congress no more they had to run you out of their Republican Party probably help to help them change your district thanks for nothing\nIt's usually a civil disobedience\nIs just such a program on the radio [noise]\nHey Joe Walsh here and I've got great news for people just like me who have struggled to pain I'm Talking of course about relief factor a one hundred percent botanical product with four ingredients that had been helping thousands of people just like me with my back pain and general muscle aches and pains I'm Talking about ...\nMaybe you're struggling even walk because of the pain or maybe even getting out of a chair is painful or sleeping through the night it's hard to do because of the pain if you've tried everything else like I did get out of the ... and you simply need to go to release\nFactor dot com to order the three we quit start only Nineteen dollars and Ninety five\nCents that's less than a dollar a day to see if you can lower or even eliminate your pain and remembered nearly ... percent of those who ordered the quick start go on to order more hit that's amazing and it's one hundred per cent drug free relief factor dot com relief\nFactor dot com or call eight hundred five hundred eighty three eighty four that's eight hundred and five hundred eight three eight for\nIf you're a small business owner than you need to know about you line you line is the leading distributor a shipping industry and packaging materials to businesses to North America they serve hundreds of thousands of small business customers right here in the U.S\nIn July understands that small business owners are the engine of our economy\nIf any part of your business involves packing or shipping materials\nAnd here's the deal you need you line their cat luggage huge and it's full of high quality products they offer the same day shipping them more than twenty seven thousand industrial products and july's customer service is second to none for all of your shipping and industrial product needs\nContact you line called them today at one eight hundred to nine five five five one zero or go on line that you line dot com slash while snatch U.
