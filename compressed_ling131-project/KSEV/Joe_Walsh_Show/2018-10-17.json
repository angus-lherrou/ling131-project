brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affective immediately know word\nOr from the president of Honduras a Mexican officials\nAre remember last time when this happened in April and may Mexico just let them walk right on through no word yet as to what the Mexican officials will do\nOur U.S Department of homeland security said today that uh what we see day in and day out at the border is a result of well advertise and well known catch and release loopholes we cannot allow it to happen you will recall and I need to say this don't get angry at me\nPresident Trump made a similar threat back in April with the last caravan\nPresident Trump last time when a couple of thousand of them came up he threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras\nOr that never happened and the uh the migrants the illegals reached our southern border\n\nCan't let that happen again\nIn Mexico is not going to cooperate\nOr then they will probably make it to our border\nBut that doesn't mean we have to let them in\nBut that doesn't mean we have to let him in and let's hope this time or the Trump Administration sticks to that\nLet me go to Greg Greg\nHey Joe I was just going to say a couple things first of all\nIf someone thinking asylum right yeah vi is they're fleeing for something like violent yes it's been violent Honduras when they reach Guatemala they've already found asylum\nThank you write this really what they're looking for is not asylum they're looking for a drink driving to a place where there's more of blue and nothing wrong with that I don't blame them but that's what they're looking to\nDo and oh by the way it goes right Greg Greg I'm giving you can point but just to back up your first point Guatemala again has said they will not provide asylum to these people\nRight out of the matter is you know if it if there were another\nWealthy country between us\nAnd you have this caravan you out there\nRight yep just come in here because we're wealthy countries out because they've they've already escaped the by one when they get ... whatever the next country of the fact that they're not quite right yeah look I don't blame it on our life is not good they want to get to go to a point about the same point a\nTrunk can threaten the same thing you want them all in Mexico they found they let the caravan continued torn on board secret funny like water and Mexico but he's got to do something you're right because we can't just let everyone in the world\nWho wants to come to the U.S in the U.S that it won't work\nThank you Greg it just it well it won't work and it's not right there are proper ways to seek asylum and it's not proper to just you win a thousand to your best friends just come walking across or crawling across our border\n\nNow everybody got upset about this when this happened at the end of April and early may this past year and the Trump Administration talked tough then but most of them eventually came in we cannot let that happen again let me go to Steve Steve [noise]\nHey why not look bad and they won't stay in there when he allowed tens of thousands of you after you get that she yeah what do they go who's who I was as
