I'm going to admit that they killed him but it was an accident\nThey're going to admit that they intended to a doctor and then bring to show me back to Saudi Arabia but that she was inadvertently killed or during the interrogation process\nClearly dish public whitewashing a is intended to what absolve the Saudi Government from purposely going out of their way to murder a journalist and murder edition\nAnd they're just going to basically say it was an\nAccident complete accident\nI Would suspect that this report will be made public later tonight or sometime tomorrow earlier today President Trump said ah that he had spoken with the Saudi king who told him that uh they had no knowledge\nThe Saudis had no knowledge of what happened\nOh which the Saudis had no knowledge\nOf what happened to show me at all Trump also came out and said you know maybe I'm maybe a ... show was killed by some four hundred pounds fat guy in his basement no I'm just kidding about that that was the Russia investigation Trump said this morning that\nMay be to show me was killed by quote role killers\n[noise] which is nonsense and it's all nonsense\nOr this is what Saudi Arabia does they kill dissidents and they kill journalist and could show me was a journalist to which hugely critical of the Saudi regime\n[noise] now the only point I'll make here and then I'd love your your feedback if you want to weigh in here three one two six fortune fifty six hundred the only point I'm going to make is look Donald Trump has bent over backwards ever since the story broke\nThis story that the Saudi Government basically a a a cold for a hip\nOr a murder of one of their journalists over dissidents or Donald Trump has bent over backwards from the beginning of the story not to offend the Saudis and all I'm saying this Trump is no different than Obama before him then George W. Bush before him\nThan Bill Clinton before George W. Bush then George W. Bush before Bill Clinton American presidents going all the way back man they bend over in bend over and bend over so as not to offend\nThe Saudis for political reasons for business reasons\nShould know don't don't tell me Trump's any different here he's doing the same damn thing Obama they're\n\nBending over what the Saudi Arabia has done here is despicable but again this is true this is this is a part of what Islam is this is Islam isn't right they should they brutal brutal or a a a regime\nA dictatorial regime or Saudi Arabia leads the planet and beheadings every year okay what did they
