[noise]\nThose are the most fun oh they don't trust or politicians either I mean at all I think the point you're actually making was that we have other considerations in this region assigned oil\nProperty tax if it didn't come up you really don't know what's your pre approved for that should make you wonder what else they may have left out at Becker mortgage we get it right\nWe haven't been around for sixty years because we're lucky yes we have a wholesale right ... and all kinds\nOf programs but in the end it's really about taking good care of people and they continue to come back

forty four that eight five five eight to five oh for forty for\nYour home dream or conservative talk radio can so you leave seven hundred am the voice of\nTexas Bosch couple of things I Want to clear up China is a socialist light socialist really communist light country\nUm are they were lightning the restrictions on property ownership for their people yes economic growth yes there are growing because they produce items and do they have a mandatory pay scales and restrictions yes but so do we\nSo do we they're producing something we're giving them money 'cause we're getting products\nEveryone says oh what are you pro China an anti ... no no no\nI'm against anybody that it's using our money using our goodwill misusing our military power and I have no problem with the country I don't have to agree with every inch of their policies\nTo want to have an open free trade system with them that that's different because I Believe once people are exposed to liberty once people are exposed to prosperity a property rights they will demand it\nI recognize what is the enlightenment and where the enlightenment from from Europe it's from it's the concept of a lack articulate and so while it's what the foundation of our country is I Want that to spread not through military force and I think when you expose the country to prosperity it will spread and\nI think you can trace back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way we only make up Seventeen percent of Chinese trade all the nonsense out there like they only exists for us when it when it's a big piece Seventeen percent they're going to do what they do regardless of our terror policies\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt COBOL country and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh show how are you\nGood good you know I wanted to go beyond just term limits and just to frame it this way let me just say real quick way they'll have a six term six terms for congressman return for senators plus if you marry a lobbyist\nThan you are the numbers on your post at the end of your time plus you after you are drama Congress cannot live in Washington or with a dirty laundry and your kid out there are a lot for Juanita\nEars were you and I agree David to me the only restrictions in this country should be on politicians and the thing about when you're when you are a merry a lobbyist that's a little different than what the urban did which is he was married and then his wife became a lobbyist and you know you wouldn't believe\nWhat the batting averages of her clients who hire her to get something done and the fact that gets done what you think it is\nBecause I tell you what it's better than ... that's for sure\nSo [laughter] and and the idea about term limits of course there should be term limits but why would they term limit themselves to pick pockets cut their hands off\nCourse they don't it's why would they turn limit themselves when they have the best job in the world they literally do do the less than zero have targeted special interest that pay them for their benefit then at the end of it you know what they get called adorable and the pension\nFor their benefit then at the end of it you know what they get called honorable and the pension\nAnd they could do whatever they want why would you leave that why would you leave them so the difference as we need to change that we need to change it all limitations in this country shouldn't be on you and me and what insurance policy want the job or replacing them and it shouldn't be ... it\nShould be on them and some of these things need to start with the money because you know what the article and drove to report was today on the top article Democrats reads a billion dollars a billion one billion dollars\nI mean I Know it's not conservative anymore it's not a a fundamental principle of Republicanism to want to limit the money to the politician but I Do let me say right off the absolute only limitation of the country should be on the politician because the idea that we like Mitch McConnell make forty four ... four Seventy four million dollars\nAnd his father in law become the greatest shipping mogul in China and we worked on these on my team\nIt's crazy to me crazy\nAnd it doesn't stop David Armstrong recognize a thank you so much\nA kid that my favorite give me a Andy blind to Andy thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh ... appreciate it\nA shot or you don't go by um [noise] I I wanted to figure out about ... very much\nI Love it stealing a write off open a notorious feeling I Love it\nMan the the local municipality I I just moved out of a little town award Charlotte cornfields and sure enough this big developer wanted to move in North point\nYeah where are you hearing to be relieved of the taxes you pay\nOnly three years old and\nTwenty three dollars no that was so\nSo so it's getting bigger because everyday earn more and more accidents on interstate ... mainly\nRight where all these trucks are following off and on the interstate to go through the existing federal [noise] and\nIt's going to be all these hundreds of millions of billion dollars\nFlowed here's the thing and here's what you gotta know Chicago Illinois in particular the entire state for the you know that's what I mean Chicago's you've been doing this for decades Illinois is not doing it because the reality is they can't get economic growth without giving the money to do it\nSo in other words they're giving them twenty three years of no property taxes now what's killing the average Illinois and his property taxes are so you get this company and and we listened promise you I promise we won't make you pay those Texas for twenty three years not only that\nWe're going to give you sweep percentage deals on the loan you need\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there's no real restrictions and very answers and different things other people have to do because we're going to make sure you come here because we want you to create jobs but when you do the math\nWhat she was ... at Illinois has subsidize any pretend girls\nThere is no real growth\nThere is only the illusion the the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended had because of its fail you failed policies\nPeople who can do and they leave\nThe other people are here to love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave but how to do in life it proceed and and fake the the the the pretend the illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeted industries in people\nThat's why if you're an independent taxpayer you want to get your taxes lower it's easy to write clout\nCall up the right to go to a burger quota might matter to get hired their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember if they failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it would it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them gods and that's why they sell it\nWhen you say you can't be there all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put mustard on it they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book in your life make it the road to serfdom by higher because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe wrote he warns you do not clued which socialism for is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive none\nNot the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago because that's the other thing recognize that we pretend there was an election going on oh really is there an electric they're Seventeen version for the same freak Seventeen versions of the same nonsense and then spread it out to the state you got seven foot stupid Laurel and hardy of failure\nYou got router and Pritzker ooh what's the big difference\nAnd I the one's got a wife very involved the other one seemed like she doesn't say much I'll go with the quiet wife\nBecause it's the same policies that same bend inspired
