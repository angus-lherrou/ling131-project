actually put people in the hospital\nAnd you know we did have a guy that's\nYou know why do outrageously no fear yes there was an outrage\nBut there was fear I remember where\nWhy do you remember everybody blaming uh whoever was present at the time from now what was going on\n[noise] okay see and that's the whole thing with the the main stream media fair such a joke I mean it's just ridiculous and the thing is this guy has to be the worst bomb maker in the world I mean I don't agree with what he did fail glad they didn't go off\nBecause that would have just given given them more in the nation but still it's gotten out of hand on both sides it really have that are just talking about Maxine Waters yeah OK\nRather have them do that but people have been physically attacked in the street not just run out of a restaurant but somebody some pro life one than the other day was actually attacked physically attacked salt\nSo it's just it's outrageous on both sides and I agree it's got a

are these people getting this rates all mattered one Seventy a hundred and eighty thousand dollar salary a year\nYeah but am I going to blame or am I going to blame the people that keep voting Rebecca

else who they can and can't away\nRight because we don't want other people you know no no no ... well I I\nKnow I'll I'll I'll I'll go I'll go I'll go just as far here\nAnd I I I have other things I
