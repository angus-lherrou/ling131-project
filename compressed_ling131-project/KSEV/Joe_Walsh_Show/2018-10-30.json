cars driveway that's at the turn it right there and we also have our own numbers that are armed and scattered throughout you know who\nThey died for the life of me\nI don't understand why more churches since and the guy just don't do that\nThat's why I was ... I mean\nThe polls don't [noise] nine eleven and yeah so it's a little bit I mean that's that's what it\nIs you know some coming down the million or so or start up a no one there being prepared or it will work we're taking an approach them up and down the wars and hope\nFor you Don thank you awesome and by the way guys come on now this is how we used to do it in America we defended ourselves\nAll you stupid crazy lives all your gun grabbers don't you get\nThese people in that seemed like sitting ducks these beautiful people in their sixties and seventies and eighties and nineties shame on us they were sitting ducks\n\nEvery congregation should have trained armed people even a few years\nWe got to defend ourselves\nGuns are leaving guns are not going away for not getting where the guns in this country and never going to happen and it should never happen\nShow why you saw we've got to defend ourselves especially in our houses of worship\nWe've got to defend ourselves especially in our houses of worship hey Dan you're on with Joe\nBill or couldn't agree with you more a concealed carry every day ... dress them or come home and go to\nA man a concealed carry in my house and ... why do you have\nTo clean your house such lose someone breaks him I don't have time to go upstairs and get a little safe and get the gum and come back don't need to have it with me\nAnd when I go to church yes I take my ... my pastor and those are habits and he gives me a link is I enter the door he feels better knowing I'm there\nOh boy Dan that's so good to hear that show good to hear he knows any feels better\n... sandwich is we'll just weigh eight years of the leverage to make sure I appear 'cause we close [laughter] older and feels so good when he was not a hero Sunday ban the use the leverage to make sure that they're ...\nA lot of God Bless how 'bout that then it might actually increase church attendance they command and hopefully there are people in the shoes with you who are trained and armed\nMisusing complicated and and to me there's no debate here there's none\nYou you ... and look uh\nI I I'm not I'm not going to harp on or pick on the reaction from so many of our Jewish American friends in Pittsburgh and around the country who so many of whom are specially reform Jews and too many conservative juice or just rabidly anti gun\nYou better wake up a good guy with a gun\nThat is that is the best of the first in the last line of defense Patrick thanks you for hanging on man\nOh Joseph ... listen in my opinion the reason why so many people blame politicians ... anything evil that happens it it goes back to what you've been saying for ... for a long time if because too many of us\nLook to government to solve all our problems oh God yeah it it's like we're limited and and we can't do anything without government\nThe only thing government does well is pick up the garbage and they don't do that too well [laughter] I mean and that's the that's the nexus of it if we just sit there and say helped me tell me what to think tell me how to react\nIt that that's nuts yeah and and until we straightened that out you know this will never end and we'll just blame politicians because we look to them like their God\nWell said my friend Patrick wells said thank you I'm I'm just and I'll close on this and we'll move on I'm I'm just so\nTired of\nIncidents like what happened in Pittsburgh doesn't have to be this way doesn't have to happen this way look ... you you got if you've got an evil white guy who\nIs dead set on killing black people it's awful hard to stop them if you've got an evil black guy intent upon killing white people look in a free society hard to stop them if you've got an evil anti Semite intent upon killing a bunch of Jews looking at an open free society it's damned tough to stop\nAt the end of the day all we've got these us\nYou can't you can't put a police officer on every block you can't put a police officer and every church in every synagogue in every school in every library we can't\nDo that can't do that\nSo what are you going to do just going to wait until it happens again what are you going to know\n\nAre you going to prepare for there was a time and there was a day in America\nWhere this was not such a wide wild way outdoor kind of an idea you're going to church on Sunday yeah they're going to be people sitting in those views who are packing and they know how to use those crimes that that that used to be America back in the day\nNow it's like oh that's a weird idea no it's not no not at all\n\nI Love to say it and all close by saying that again I Love to say because it is the ultimate truth and I love to say it because I Love to put this\nOut there in front of all those limbs and all those people on the left who who want to get really guns and they think guns are guns are the source of all the evil the truth is the only thing that will stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun period\n\nNot
