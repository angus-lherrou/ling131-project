four weeks before the midterms\nThe story of the day one of Donald Trump's President Trump's or most highly respected and popular and I would add a effective a team members UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced today that she stepping down\nShe's resigning affective at the end of the year to say that this news sent a shock wave to Washington DC a would be an understatement\nAgain they threw together this meeting in the oval office this morning Hern Trump\nThey set all the right things Nikki Haley the best you could get out of her was\nYou know she's been going hard for eight years she was governor for six years you and ... it will be for two years she needs to step aside she needs a break fine why make that announcement before the midterms I Can't emphasize this enough she is a\nHuge is damn good at what she did and that's a loss she was so good and the un because to be infected and ineffective\nAmbassador to the un you got a very clear eyes understand what the UN is to not be afraid to call the un out and Nikki Haley was never afraid to call me an institution out Nikki Haley was never afraid to call any corrupt regime out\nI I mean remember when when a President Trump made that congratulatory called the Turkish president air airline and Nikki Haley almost immediately after that\nTurkey's miserable record on human rights abuses a Trump important to say it's a love affair was another statement Nikki Haley never wasted an opportunity\nIt's a love affairs and none of your statement Nikki Haley never wasted an opportunity to castigate mosque out for their horrible human rights record conservatives love her\nShe's a link between conservatives and the president she she will be missed she will be mess let me go to Jeff\nAnd Jeff you around with Joe Walsh\nAt your idea like I Am just absolutely heartbroken Nikki Haley\nAll done three great thing that I was at that one is of course hedge to his cabinet and three is Nikki Haley I'm so sorry to see her go smart articulate kick butt pet's names and beautiful to she'll be slowly slowly met\nOne day she because she would lead to a horrible liberal Democrats you'd be fantastic\nAnd that's OK late so for that one HIV\nJeff thanks uh no I I agree she's got a bright future and she intimated today that she's not out of the game she's not out of the arena it's just again guys a politics the timing is weird\nTrump just had one of his best the best weekends of his presidency and then you start out this week with what is\nJust straightforward bad news just straight bad news for the Trump Administration are ... and it and it gets people thinking like why why why is she is she going to run for the United States Senate if South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham becomes attorney general I mean you started all these crazy crazy games\nWhich is unfortunate\nBut it's natural because the timing here is strange let me go to Laurie Laurie [noise]\nHey how you found out she addressed [noise]\nHey Laurie that say that say a great notion because again it was just so odd and abrupt you know what I mean\nRight now I'm thinking man in it so it was the only thing that I like to the

because of the time I mean I mean the timing much more so than she's leaving\nYou know ...\nYou you you arrive be UN ambassador for two years you go deal with the United nations I don't know that I could last two years or two days it's amazing that she lasted or will last two years\nI just think that this is an announcement that would've been much better for Republicans this November if this announcement had been made\nAfter these midterms are let me go to Google or Yahoo group gory oh you're on my friend\nJoe slowdown brother\nMuch has been wondering why she is strong she removes\nBut let's see you know she'd been governor and like you just said do you work in the United nations is a lot of people who were dumb and can function over anybody ... got to take care of yourself first they were really buddy\nAgree man agree look I that's not she's leaving and resigning for whatever reasons are and I'm fine with that uh she's an asset and she'll be missed that's not the issue\nTo me the big issue which has every Republican and Democrat wondering is why make this announcement now\nThree to four weeks before the midterm it's not that she's going to make the why make the announcement now there is not a Republican in Washington DC there is not one single Republican running to get re elected this November who would've wanted Nikki Haley to make this announcement now\n\nThe Democrats are beside themselves you know why because this takes Brett Kavanaugh off of the front pages\n\nLet's hope glory or if you're still listening again let's hope it's nothing like

you just my answer from my God I think your observations are correct I think things are ugly or an messier and more divided now than they've ever been or then since they've been in a long very long time\nI don't think it's going to get better\nAnd I don't think we'll ever all be in this one together any more\nI I just think we've reached a point in America where\nWe have people in America who just fundamentally believe they've got two different ideas of what America is\nAnd I don't think you can fix that or bring that together so I I don't see I don't see the country ever becoming more unified I'm Sorry to use ...\nImage accidentally or that are so [noise]\nUm yes yes but in in my defense Becky and then I'll give you the final word I Am certainly responsible in\nHelping to nudge this divide along and that's because Becky I I actually think to divide is good is a good thing I think it's natural\nI think it's natural that America has become so big after two hundred and forty some years um that division is probably the best thing for us but boom Becky I'll give you the final word go ahead that\nActually as I can call it here that\nI'm Sorry but you know hey you love me for saying what I Believe though right [noise]\n[noise] so you don't have to love [laughter]\nSo right [noise] um [noise] you know a lot [laughter]\nBecky I'm Glad you called look you asked a question I'm going to give you an answer and I'm Sorry\nI I really am but\nLook I Do I Do the division here's what I Know I Want to live in a country of free men and women I Want to live in a country where most men and women get to keep damn near all of the money they make\nI Want to live in a country where we are responsible for ourselves our families are communities tend to our churches in government stays the hell out of our lives and Becky that's the country we were given Becky we don't have that country anymore\nAnd I'd argue that there are a lot of us that want that free country back that's the divide these days I appreciate your call Becky I really do please call\nA again let me go to Jason hey Jason your term\nJoe how are you are but it's a pleasure talking you're an honor right back at ya
