at\nWalsh freedom a\nLook Eric and Eric Holder former attorney general and you probably think about Eric Holder like I think about Eric Holder but it's not necessarily important what you and I think about Eric Holder what is important is to listen to what he said\nUh Eric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia\nA yesterday talking to a room full of Democrats not now look we\nHad so many Republicans and conservatives who were bother by what Hillary Clinton said yesterday when Hillary Clinton said or the days of being civil are over\nNow I wouldn't bother by what she said I I understood it or they're they're duck or Trump's not a civil guy\nOr the Democrats have figured it out a Trump is on civil a Trump kick their butts so the Democrats are thinking ... uh we need an on civil guy or gal to beat him that's all they're doing right now Eric Holder in a room full of Democrats\nPretty much a boat out the same message we're\nNo longer getting to be nice guys\n\nLet me see

viscous\nSo what's going on\nAgain you can listen to Fox News another conservative talk radio and\nAnd get angry about this and and be bothered by what he'll reach said or what Eric Holder said to me that's pretty stupid what's going on what's going on with the Democrats right now see I Want to know what's going on with the Democrats\nShow I can beat them so I can defeat them well here's what's going on right so right now I'm speaking every Republican and conservative who is listening to me\nYou're reading what fighting back\nLooks like\nI I mean Donald Trump comes on a machine three years ago and he fights Andy punches any punches any punches everyday oh lord Eric Holder said yesterday that's nothing compared to things that Trump said Donald Trump has been fighting against the Democrats\nFor three years and that's why he's in the White House the Democrats are fighting back that's all the Democrats are fighting back look\nThe Democrats understand\nThat Donald Trump isn't that she'll be anyone and by the way both of those things are true Donald Trump isn't that she'll be Angie did win and I don't\nKnow when I hear Hillary and I hear all these other Democrats and I hear Eric Holder\nYesterday a at a campaign event to me it's just telling me that's what Eric Holder said Eric Holder pretty much said you know what we need and that she'll be the beat that they'll be that's all what's the big deal about that why get bothered about that the Democrats have wised up\n\nA nice guy isn't going to be Trump a nice lady is not going to be\nTrump that's what Eric Holder said and as despicable as Hitler Clinton is that what Hillary said yesterday\nWhen she said we're done being civil\nNow the Democrats have realized they need and that she'll be to try to beat our actual be that should not surprise anybody on our side\nAnd I I Would just argue I put it in front of me again everybody\n\nThere is no better motivation in the world than anger\nAnd the Democrats have it\nThan when Eric Holder said what he said and Hillary Clinton said what she said forget about what they said look at the reaction\nEvery Democrat said hell yeah when they go low man we kick them when they go low we punch show\n\nDemocrats are fired up\nMake a make no mistake\nAbout it let me go to Chris Chris\n[noise] well Hey Joe first of all thanks for taking my call met her and I walked away from the Democratic party and if any Democrat tries to kick me I happened to be going to take my conceal carry classes we can I say bring it on but in in regards to the door right being\nUpset about what Hillary and Mr holder said over the last couple of days yeah when I'm teaching from this isn't so much that they're anybody's irate but they do take some ... with the fact that they're\nThat they're saying that a\nVictory somehow they previously somehow being classy about the situation which they clearly have it\nI've never seen anybody on the right encourage us to go out and harassed people in public places are abused people which have been going for an extended period of time so all of a sudden they're saying oh we're going to do this right well you haven't done it right up to this point so forgive me for not buying or v asked no no\nAnd Chris I'm not saying that they've been saying before this all I'm saying this Trump is no saint Trump is now of course now Trump's Trump's not a civil guy he isn't that she'll be\nAnd why voted for exactly and all I'm saying is the Democrats have reached that realization that they really need and that so beat even try to compete with them and and and\nAnd and that's absolutely the truth but they when they try to say that they've been trying to ask themselves off as having previously been saying which clearly no
