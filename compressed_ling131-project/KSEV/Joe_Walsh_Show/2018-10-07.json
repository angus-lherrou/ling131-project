doing it [noise] I'm grateful to the FBI for their efforts in doing a thorough very important investigation\nMany of us have said that have judge Kavanaugh did what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people\nSome outside people should be disqualified but after investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI [noise] we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away his confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nFor I think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise] that's how I judge to him for the way he's been traded yes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel\nVery worried and upset about about ... a Republican getting this said because they thought they had won the election but that isn't the case in our side has handled this I think was discretion\nHaving every problem that has come up and frankly I Hope we can just move forward and you get this done 'cause the right thing to do

nominee that would be subjected to the unacceptable\nCharacter assassination that we've seen directed at this nominee in this case if that's the new normal I don't know who would want to serve and frankly I think people would be justified losing any respect\nFor the Senate didn't away conducts himself during the confirmation process so Moore is at stake injustice domination and the Supreme Court for Senate itself is on trial if you're\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be an endorsement of the mishandling of this\nConfirmation process because of hiding relevant information that could have been examined on a bipartisan basis in a way that respected doctor forge request for privacy and um gotten to the bottom of this as we've attempted to do now\nWith twenty million people watching on television\nOr vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a confirmation vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person and it will be a vote for this shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign\nAgree that the FBI investigation now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people\nThought through the seven background investigations the judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three top no crop ration no confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made against him unfortunately this could have all been avoided\nMost of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and and the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations nose in the regular process and could have been investigated as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nI've said before and not say it again I Believe that we should and we did tree Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters are my wife\nOr my mother treated under similar circumstances but we have to remember\nThat judge Kavanaugh's you've had a little fair process to and he has not been subjected to a fair process anything butts so now's the time to quit all of these antics these high Jake's the surface like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed this good man to this important position [noise]\n\n\nProfits of reviewing the FBI reports that we received this morning a has been exhausted and it has been a collaborative process with my colleagues a it occurred in in a classified environment because these are documents that were not allowed to return to disclose to the public\nUh but because we can review them and only one place we review them together and we stopped and we talked about each point made to make sure that we understood or is the message from each interview in each report or\nThe message from each interview and each report ah\nAlthough that part of it by operation of law is not allowed to be public I Want to give you the difference that we treated these documents just as we treated each and every allegation without no serious that's what a desire to do nothing more than search for the truth\nAnd just as we've spent hours upon hours hearing testimony in an open hearings before the public we also spent hours upon hours for viewing these documents in a classified environment\nAllegations of sexual misconduct are serious of sexual assault or of a most serious nature and always have to be treated with most seriousness may have been in this case\nAgain Vince was someone who's been through seven background investigations in the course of the last three decades\nWith over a hundred and fifty people interview with regard to him as a man of outstanding character who has lived an exemplary life he and his family has been subjected to a lot of questioning a lot of embarrassment to a lot of humiliation in recent weeks\nFor that\nHas been a difficult part of this process for him but in the process of doing that who's proven his character and his willingness to be candid with the public and even sharing facts that are at times so uncomfortable\nI'm convinced of this man's character of his true for most of his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court or the United states I wholeheartedly support the\nConfirmation and look forward to voting for him in the coming hours\n[noise] full\nOf agree with everything my colleagues have said I\nAlso want to say that Dr Ford I firmly believe experienced a traumatic event in her life I also believe that there is no evidence that we've seen\nThrough the FBI background checks through the time that we both spent on the hearing 'em to substantiate that these claims are properly alleged and directed towards judge Kavanaugh\nThousands of pages in that briefing room my our ... our in that room together for an hour we break for an hour than we were all back for two hours um [noise]\nHad the desk is also some Fifteen hundred pages that document the
