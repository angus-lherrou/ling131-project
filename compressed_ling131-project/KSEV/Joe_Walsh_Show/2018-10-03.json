care about is the FBI supposedly could be done with their investigation as early as tonight\nOr maybe tomorrow morning or Mitch McConnell and the Republicans have still sworn that there will be a vote before this week is out Republicans and Democrats they're both yelling and hollering about nothing very important that's where we that's where we stand see\nThis is what's always angered us some issues and give us way before Trump or I'm not alone many of us have railed about this double standard in the media\n\nThey only go after Republicans and conservatives and they ignore when Democrats behave badly and it's been around forever I mean when I ran for Congress eight years ago I had to put up with the same thing\nWhat makes Trump's unique is Trump is the first president Republican who's called them out\nOr the first president who's called them out for this double standard this bias but when my buddy last night who's a liberal and he asked me that he couldn't believe he couldn't believe that our side which still sticking with Brett Kavanaugh and I said you don't understand man\nWe've had to live with the media double standard forever it's not fair we're tired of it\nThe media is trying to take this man down and we know in our bones we know in our bones to Brett Kavanaugh was a lefty the media would not be going after him if Brock Obama nominated\nA Brett Kavanaugh and he was a lefty this would not be a big story the media wouldn't be digging in two ... books they wouldn't be digging in how much he drowned\nThe story the media wouldn't be digging in ... to ... books they wouldn't be digging in how much he drank in high school\n\nAnd again that made over ... story in Texas I think vividly\nDescribes the double standard beta O'Rourke who's running against Ted Cruz is a progressive Democrat gets a DUI when he's twenty six it's another automobile tries to flee the scene and the national media ignores the story\nIs paid over or or a conservative Republican beta O'Rourke would probably have to step down\nProbably would have to leave the race\nLet me go to Eric Eric you're on with Joe\nAnd Joe yeah good show um yeah you know the Democrats the answer to the media's double standard about as far as the Senate comparing that to the Supreme Court justices but they're they're saying that that's the than the state yeah and there's a lifetime appointment okay\nLet's grant grant them that and let's let's go back and not have some Senate hearings\nAnd bringing bringing Elena Kagan then a justice so sort of my or back in and go through their your book and see if we can reverse a reverse or get them thrown off the Supreme Court they want to play\nThat yeah yeah that's a great point thank you man that's a great point I appreciate it but let me do you want better forget about the Supreme Court angle\nCome on now everybody be honest with me right now Ted Cruz's in a tough fight down in Texas He tried to hang onto his Senate seat I Want you to be honest with me imagine four weeks ago\nForget about the Supreme forget about capping off from their imagine four weeks ago it wasn't paid or war but imagine four weeks ago we found out that Ted Cruz\nGot a DUI when he was twenty six imagine that we found out that Ted Cruz behind the wheel of a nod immobile hit another automobile and tried to flee the scene of the crime\n\nImagined that which Ted Cruz Republican Ted Cruz conservative Ted Cruz\nYou know come on\nYou know CNN Anderson Cooper would be all over this thing MSNBC NBC ABC all of them the New York times would write a twenty\nPage piece because it's Ted Cruz it's conservative Ted Cruz\nYou see that shit right there\nThat's it right there I Know I all I care about is the truth I don't care about any of this other stuff when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh I care about the truth will probably never know the truth and if we don't know the truth and there was no other evidence than Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court\nBut you look\nAt what the media has done outside of that allegedly incident thirty five years ago you look at what\nThe media has done to try to destroy this man\nLooking into every aspect of his life
