this hour on Wall street Robert work when I was a second wildcard gamble start a hockey\nAnd entertainment critic Kevin car over here to review the latest movie version of star is born all I had this half our first line [noise]\nSeven minutes after they are now the White House has received the supplemental FBI background check on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be opened up four senators this morning correspond them show I'm adding layers on Capitol Hill where it's tick tock tick tock\nThe clock starts there is now we vote scheduled for some time on friday likely friday morning that'll be the first test of whether or not Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is able to get the fifty or fifty one votes he needs to actually move Brett Kavanaugh's nomination forwarding finals confirmation vote\nIf they get the votes on friday within happened on Saturday recap it offered the elevated at the Supreme Court by the end of the week and here's the reality right now obviously they decided to start the clock even before the Senate Republicans and Democrats received\nThe FBI supplemental background of application senators will be able to start reading all one hundred senators will have access to that background investigation basically what they're gonna do is go in a way to eight am Senate Republicans will be able to start reading it still\nBe able to read it for an hour then said Democrats are coming in for an hour and they'll rotate back and forth until everybody has an opportunity to read the report or be briefed on the report by a limited number of staffers who will have access to it looks the bottom line here is the same as it has been for the last couple of weeks this all comes down to whether five senators\nAre three Republicans and two Democrats who remain undecided on this issue\nSee what they need to see in that report you either vote yes for a vote no I can tell you right now that the majority leader does not have commitments from any of those five senators now a number of them have been leaning yes or so they want to get to yes Jeff Flake voted yes in the community\nBut I Can't overstate enough how important this background investigation will be\nMultiple senators multiple those five senators have said what they see in its investigation\nWill go a long way to deciding whether or not they can get to yes an enormous day not just for the Senate and not just for background investigations in general for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nStill tells us that there has been some talk portions of the background report could end up being read aloud on the Senate floor\nI'm Talking portions of the background report could end up being read aloud on the Senate floor\nIt would be a surprise on a definite breaking decorum ... there's no question about it but I think one of a one of the issues and centers have been trying to figure out is\nIf this is all to be kept private if this is all to be kept only to a small group of technically a hundred and nine people who would have access to it how will you ever be able to prove it exonerated Brett Kavanaugh or approved Christine Blasey Ford correct or any of those things the only the best metric I've been given up to this point is\nIf they get fifty plus votes and there wasn't anything that was to damage to Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I I I think it depends on the individual member there are senators Jeff Flake being one of them Susan Collins to some degree has certainly been more leaning towards yes over the course of the last couple of days and\nThen perhaps other senators and the Democrats I think are are paying close attention to whether or not Republicans can get fifty on their own\nWhich ended up twenty games just mentioned by the NHL for in a
