all volatility in the country is due to President Trump ally and then Trump has contributed to the volatility in the country it paid just to him it will continue after you've gone and the media provide\nSo let's say for example Katie Katie ... over at MSNBC obviously a member of the left and came to her was mind hit by a get it out some of the violent rhetoric use by Democrats and recently she didn't like it wasn't willing to talk about it because obviously only one side of the political ... bad and volatile and you over heated rhetoric\nDo ... ... ... other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or are given kudos to another politician through body slammed reporter have you ever heard that from anybody else other than Donald Trump\nAnd the answer is no it's terrible\nRight now it's terrible when President Trump says that also it's terrible when Democrats say that you should have people when they said he should confront people in public places when Bernie Sanders claims that Republicans are going to kill millions of people with their health care plan can pretend\nThat the volatile political climb in the United states is anything that was ridiculous but then there's been a longstanding democratic tactic for legitimate decade which actually is dangerous for the country for two reasons\nOne of the dangerous about the media to take on that is when they suggest that rhetoric that does not incite violence is responsible for violence air criminalizing rhetoric\nAnd when they do it for only one side it appears that they only want to criminalize rhetoric on one side which leads people to believe that they are coming for you\nAnd you fail to acknowledge that has to fail to acknowledge what's driving a lot of our politics the gate which is a reactionary feel and the other side of threatening you\nAnd its presence on both sides now let's get to the right wing response Solomon preemptively do there are people on the right I think most people on the right and set looking means you wait for more information here we don't know who did that most likely outcome is crazy person I tend to\nRepeatedly I said if you think that the false light attacker you jumped to the conclusions falls flat a tactic are nothing but confirmation by you're doing it wrong there weren't they can show some threat I'm On the right that suggests it had to be a Democrat it had any somebody on the left who perpetrated the because obviously it was convenient for Democrats in the run up the election\nThis sort of conspiracy you're riding is not good either the reason that it is not that either because it allows people to believe that there are no ... on their own die an evil in entirely relegated to people who disagree with them it leads to more polarization\nAnd again it nothing for the country when he jumped to conclusion based on your own confirmation bias and right now there's tremendous incentive to do just that\nThere's no incentive for people to say look wait for more information that's the way from our information is one of the least popular because an American politics and usually right it's almost always right\nBut he took the lead popular phrase because if you jump to a conclusion and then jump to end up being right your life has talked back I got there you know how you know he gets it because it's got what's right and he gets it and if you're on your own side as well that was right it's just the fact that he got in the case but he's still knows what\nIt's like jumping to conclusions from being intensified on every side right now and it's really bad and it's particularly now in the president of the United states does insult legitimacy legitimately just a couple of hours before the FBI arrest and the fact that President Trump started tweeting\nAbout the mom stop this morning so he created out of Afghanistan funny\nHad already made CNN and others can convince I'd met with even blaming may but it turns out of bounds and the ... and it's like comparing to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing and when they criticize them into Web and scream it's just not presidential\nHe's right about that one at president on the correct about that one when he has the media rent them and the court judgment well and when he when he responded against like the Cumberland or Oklahoma City and he's and he's creating that he's not wrong about that but here's what President Trump does go wrong again just stop there at seven Nineteen am without\nRepublican I Do too well in any voting and at the polls and now the quote unquote bombs stuff happening and the momentum ... new not talking politics there and pushing it what is going on Republican go out and the\nAnd the problem with people sending bombs in the mail not impact on voting is people sending bombs in the mail and the congestion that this is all just distressed by the media when people can bombs in the males with like a prominent democratic and you know and it's not and when you lend credence to conspiracy theory oh you are doing is fueling the planes with the volatility\nEveryone thinks oh basic bottom line of a show a lot of people talk right now\nComing up let's talk about how we can make the country chocolates and what we can do personally southwest because in fact I think are kind of fucking these days and a lot of that has to do with reactionary motive and moon happening in response to more reactionary motives you rode your car insurance [laughter]\nAnd let's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight the trouble and the problems of others it is not right and the lord and doesn't want it and our people ask\nTheir hearts wants to reach out to others look at what they do in the storms they go when they ran out people they don't know they put them in their homes they feed on some ... ... not only from your garbage and this is a vision and yelling and screaming and hatred on all sides\nOkay well it also true that why does America is maintaining a border so there's that as well but even John ... the guy who's going to bring it to altogether can't stop myself from using this sort of overheated rhetoric it\nIt's a problem okay do\nMeanwhile speaking of overheated rhetoric Megan Kelly is going to be out and be the\nUh she's out an empty because they are basically sending about Megan Kelly being raped us so this was sort of predictable making probably would not getting good ratings in mourning and so they decided that they wanted to dump her and then they found any Houston down her when she said I'm a morning show\nThat she didn't see what was wrong with people darkening their skin for Halloween costumes they accused her of being pro laughing as we've discussed over the last couple of days they switched sheer absolute nonsense we'll talk about the media tempted polarized the culture\nOn the issue of race but first let's talk about your online hated security with all the recent news

polarized political rhetoric for even tiny gains right now on every issue\nThat's a real problem here folks are blaming President Trump for the bombing today\n... for the attempted bombing Tom Nichols is one of the people\nWho is doing that to Tom Nichols has a whole political agent in anti Trump Republican and here's what he treated out and then I ... I think it\nIsn't it to the point of the question is whether Madame ... not since he clearly is that's not the president's all the better question is whether the White House in the media complex is pushing the crazy do so hard it's making unstable people more likely to be violent\nAnd said many times the lone wolf guys who play scientists or the white supremacy or the anti abortion violence are coup\nWent looking for a cause they have to go find the propaganda and when they do they mean line at\nThe difference here is that really hateful started coming in waves not from foreigners are fringe group from White House wants to rallies from widely cited Internet sites that have billions of followers in from a four hour window and hot crazy noted box in primetime which is very convenient for\nTom Nichols and there's no one in politics or when media made the guy ten bump period when they didn't say what super heat the political environment in flood crazy be out into the information they show regularly at an change unhinged guys like that and they're being paid for by ... by tiny mom\nOkay let's assume that triggered him that when you heat up the political water that more frogs jumped out of the pot but just assume that that's the case let's let him that\nWell one of the same holds true on the last when they overheat the political rhetoric when they say for example that Megan Kelly is an absolute racist when they say that anybody who even mentioned Halloween costumes is so racist that they cannot be employed\nAnd when did the same like Kirsten Powers has a piece today about how Megan Kelly is a rapist because she is white just making something really racist should not be surprising than anyone in radio thing was that Kelly was hired by by NBC at all\nHow he had a long track record of racial demagoguery at Fox before she ever set foot in the studio and so now I get is this heating up the political [laughter] and I think it is I think in that op ed from George Yancey professor of philosophy at Emory University which obviously need to better philosophy department hidden piece today called ... I Am ...\nAnd he says it's time we met and take responsibility for our role in\nThe problem of violence against women and that all men are guilty of violence against women\nThat I decided not to cut corners joined me with due diligence in civic duty and publicly proclaiming I Am second\nIn fact perhaps at a time we lay claim to a movement I Am sectors thinking about national international implications as we take responsibility for sexism ... our patriarchy\nIt's hard to admit we're sector I for instance would like to think that I can just be genuine about ten minutes bona fide voter fight but who am I kidding I'm a failed and broken ... more pointedly I in fact that there are times when I hear from Milwaukee my own entitlement the male toxic masculinity take many forms all forms continue to hurt and to violate women\nBring gambling before I got married I insisted my wife take my last name\nAfter a short can come my way so why not take money and they become part of me she refused she wanted to keep her own last name I was not happy especially as she had her father's last name which I argued contradicted her position against patriarchy that she already this is my name and it's part of my identity and became stubborn\nAnd interpreted her decision that evidence of a lack of full commitment to me well should really only proposed that we both changed her last name and take on a new name together showing our commitment to each other\nYes obviously the guys are real anti feminist if he's a ... if you're a woman reading this\nYes obviously the guy's a real anti prominence he's a ... if you're a woman reading is I have failed you know it's like a malice forced the allergy and it sounds like a POW take\nMy silence and an uninhabited collective ... I have failed I help and continue to help perpetuate that 'cause I Know that how we hold on to forms of power and the human eye view only when they are now feeling any I recognize might silent has an act of violence it for this I can generally apologize\nAnd really what he's doing he's saying I'm not a success because I'm apologizing for that to them but every other male is factor\nIs that for heating the rhetoric is that polarizing our society and you just a little bit and let's point out the media topography when it comes to these sorts of issues and how these sorts of Asian every democratic male or consider a non ... in reality\nWhen it comes to when it comes to the media Megan Kelly happens to be a person right of center a Jimmy Kimmel gay person left of center and they weren't brought up the fact that if we're going to talk about black Jimmy Kimmel in two thousand to get an actual blackface working on national television on Comedy Central Jimmy Kimmel in in ... not

have to lose her job over it\nAnd then again pay her out but you have to lose your job again\nHe polarizing environment predated President Trump will it will go far beyond President Trump because that is the that the nature of the politics that we have chosen and if the nature of politics to continue to push for the most radical extreme\nThere's an opinion piece in today's New York times and fully anti can completely crazy and it didn't now being touted as not only mainstream but if you don't believe that then you are apparently they get\nHit by Dr ... sterling professor of biology and gender

... is crazy talk okay it's just crazy talk\nShe cites a bunch of ridiculous\n... honestly ridiculous reference to like this is my favorite just because I happen to know something about them\nShe talked about Jewish thought she was in the ancient Jewish rabbinical called noted the laptop for example sometimes treated people who had male and female park is winning and could not inherent

this stuff I Will tell you exactly what the Jewish while I was doing it for a tank this person had to\nSeparate set of general you don't know whether they're male or female therefore we're going to be a trick as possible\nIn every circumstance so we'll treat them and female perpetrated forbidding them from temple service but we'll bring them in the mail for purposes of preventing them from shade in
