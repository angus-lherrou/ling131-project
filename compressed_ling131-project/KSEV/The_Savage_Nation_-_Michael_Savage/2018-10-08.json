describe conservatives who continued to be conservative\nIn secret in this country you understand where that came from [noise]\nLet me continue there is good evidence that Columbus who Spanish name was Cristobal cologne was Jewish probably or possibly um around all the evidence is found in the will he signed on march Nineteen fifty no sex in it he ought to the Jewish customers leaving a portion of his wealth to the needy\nHe's specifically named Elizabeth Drew the beneficiary of a portion of the state\nColumbus also earmarked part of his estate to go to a group that was charged with retaking

people to accused him the most of this right well it was about with Dr fraud\nAnd I studied the research that she has done that she put her name on it as a result what she has her name I was the first to do it given that I Know research and lo and behold ... guess what I found she published papers on the use of the morning after drug for abortion\nTo treat women for depression that means she's owned in my analysis by the\nAbortion industry and the abortion drug industry\nThis is a billions of dollars a year our and if you want to just make this crudely financial the abortion racket tears and that includes all our senators viciously slandered Kavanaugh every one of them probably receives tons of money\nDirectly or indirectly from abortion racket tears from one group to the other drug companies\nPlanned Parenthood you name it so less looking for the financial they stand to lose a ton of money here now it's let's not forget that she published papers pushing the use of the morning after pill to treat depression okay the great doctor for it I Love that doctor did you notice how\nHow many times they refer to her doctor to Florida for ... for a doctor for a doctor I liked that

doctor that we're putting aside the rhetoric\nWe're living in very dangerous time they get the left has been motivated to become violent and they're being paid to be violence and I made it a comparison on my radio show the other day are and I don't know if you've heard it on the why my Republican today mhm\nThe parallels are really frightening other than the fact that we have a great economy\nWe did not lose World War one and have to pay reparations\nThese social upheaval going on in America today is almost identical to that which went on and the answer what period in Germany after World War one before Hitler came to power and I wanted to the people who listen to my show\nThat the exact opposite of what the communist bloc thinks he's going to happen by shaking up society by attacking the middle class by harassing everyone they disagree with the exact opposite is going to happen they're not\nGoing to gain power they're going to see a complete right wing reaction in
