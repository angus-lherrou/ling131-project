read you the letter from Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend that not like a whole hindrance story we'll talk about what exactly those holes are one\nShe never mentioned for years anything about the sexual assault never mentioned cabinet now that doesn't necessarily undercut all of her credibility according to forge never said anything until two thousand twelve also he testified in front of the Tennessee never coach anybody with regard to a polygraph members made a big deal out of taking a polygraph and she still owes her over her note\nFrom her psychiatrist you turn over a polygraph no butter polygraph not read some questions on their own such as\nIn the polygraph knows the original polygraph now dead before she took the polygraph that she was sexually itself in the early eighties you cross out early\nNobody knows why then she took the polygraph and then she passed the polygraph but she testified under oath that you did not coach anyone I probably about never ask white friend says that's not true there is her testifying about that on her own\nI didn't expect it could be as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful and you have you ever given chip sure advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never [laughter]\nHey and it turns out that that is a serious question for her were you lie about that the Senator Chuck Grassley has now sent a letter to the attorney for this woman for Christine Blasey Ford and he asked for material evidence relevant to the allegations\nWon some corroborating evidence\nThat he wants to know from the therapy sessions the doctor for just ... and that you turned over to the Washington Post\nAnd he does anyone copies of all a video or audio recordings produced during the course of the polygraph contamination

or by someone who was planning on taking a polygraph doctor for replied never\nIn a statement ratings concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result but then it therefore need that information\nIs just outside of the problem there as well then she also another credibility problem it turns out that she sent her Senate testimony over and over again that she was in therapy into thousands well because you had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door is because she had security concern because she was still\nDeeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault\nAt the hands of Brett Kavanaugh will now it turns out that that's a really good story real clear investigations pulse Gary over we'll learn to

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years four testified last week\nThat she had never revealed the details of the alleged attack until twenty twelve when she was in therapy with her husband she said the memories percolated off and then we visited a disagreement they'd had over her insistence on selling a second front door when they remodeled their Palo Alto California

must be ... by Dianne Feinstein Feinstein out is that the reason for the second front door it's claustrophobia and forwards had correct\nThe documents reveal the door was installed years before as

personal since the second front doors installed from local colleges have lived any additional roll with the private door so in other words there are a lot of holes in her story\nOh which can get that maybe there's some serious questions that need to be asked about Orange County and this week it seems more questions have been raised about that account that have actually been raised about Brett Kavanaugh coming on the president of the United states could\nNot hold himself back out after a couple of weeks I was the president felt the need to feed his mind and when that just makes his mind as a whole lot that happened it doesn't stop Democrats have definitely run of the mill\nThat at some frat party at Yale Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself in front of her in one month ... irritating said cabinet asked her to go on record in his defense to other on the hit show communication between cabinet came and former classmates in advance to the story in fact also demonstrate the cabinet and remembers one more socially connected than previously understood\nAnd Ramirez it's uncomfortable around have known each other at a wedding and your dad and they graduated or comes efforts also show that some potential witnesses have been unable to get important information to the FBI on Monday a senior U.S official confirming the White House has authorized the FBI to expand that can actually

Committee Jeff ... two days after the ... their marriage allegations were reported in the New Yorker Kavanaugh claimed it was Ramirez was calling around the classmates trying to get they remembered it\nAdding it strikes me as you know what is going on here when someone in calling around to try and refreshing other people is that what's going on what's going on with that that doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good to me it doesn't sound fair it doesn't sound proper it sounds like an orchestra to hit me I was in other words\nEnding the first Clinton the cabinet was calling around to try and ... story\nAnd now it turns out that he had already testified\nHe'd already testified there is there a mirror and she was calling around to try and bolster her story\nSo good job media wells on all the way through there is another allegation that seems to be having some trouble then there was the allegation from Julie sweating it because of course coming from Michael ...\nAnd it turned out that a former boyfriend of Julie sweating it has now issued a letter\nTo the to the Senate Judiciary committee and here's what it said my name is Kendra I'm a former weeknight media meteorologist for channel seven in Washington DC and one in any in Nineteen Ninety five\nI Want to preface this by saying I Need a proud north ... in the actions he mentioned in the letter I Hope my friends family and church members can forgive me I first met Julie sweating it in Nineteen Ninety three at a Washington DC bar near Wisconsin circle\nHow's it going away party for channel ... Dale Sally I left the party to go to the bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk out conference my birthday and I sat on at the end of our Julie approach me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed and no drinking Han\nConsequently my initial thought was that you might be a high end call girl because of the time I weigh three hundred and fifty pounds so at some of my car went with me but there was no conversation about a change in fact for money so I decided to talk with her [laughter]\nI never been hit down in a bar before I didn't even heard of that and I know that we talked about getting together over the next couple of weeks we met when I Believe in ... he was Jewish place from the beginning Julie who I was married and then I was having marital issues\nAnd says she was an opportunity I thought she had only interest in my three hundred fifty pounds out because I was on TV and well known although we're not emotionally involved with physical contact we never had Texas might in fact he was very sexually aggressive with me and then he talks about\nAll of her fans jeez you know sets of multiple guys and he suggests that or she is politically motivated and and he said\nThat basically she's not going to be ... recalls her sociopath a and do that that's not great for her account either and her her account always was was really troublesome right then the getting ready to count was always a very difficult to substantiate considering there should have been when it does for any of that stuff\nWe're going to get to a final allegation of Democrats\nTried to bring up last minute and just one second\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like why would you buy generic mattress for anyone else he likes his building we quit that takes two minutes to complete\nAnd use the answers to match your body type and fleet preference is the perfect mattress whether it's I'd sleep or a hot sleep or whether you like a plush or prevent but he

five bucks off all mattress ordered get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off\nAnd he like ... dot com slash bureau and feel it sleep dot com platter bureau\nFor a hundred and twenty five about soccer mattress or\n... ... dot com slash Shapiro\nAnd to the final allegation those brought by Democrats again all the allegations are falling apart the final allegation those brought against Brett Kavanaugh was brought last minute by Senator Chris Coons so here in the accusation apparently Chris Coons forwarded an allegation related you judge Kavanaugh's years in New haven excuse or who apparently credit TV show in which people strip well dancing to their favorite music\nWhich is an awesome he didn't show probably held at a party that took place at the house of judge Kavanaugh was an undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen eighty eight school year which allegedly featured some salacious activity of court judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when the party allegedly took place and we pay for your loss during\nThat period as you well know most academically intense Simon most students' lives in allegations has all the makings of a tablet headline\nBut there's just one problem excuse are freely admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended his party is Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh attendant excuse or provide some investigative evidence he proposing that someone searched judge Kavanaugh calendars very ... your college I'm just missed and derided\nTo determine whether he attended a frat party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven or Ninety eight and that's it oh he alleges that he wants to witness the latest party at our house owned by judge Kavanaugh the undergrad fraternity and then separately invited us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh calendars to determine if he attended we have reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation\nThere's no evidence the judge Kavanaugh's anywhere near the party or anything to do with it at all\nIn fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser investigating\nAnything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser investigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore I Hope that before boarding an allegation and the future will first consider whether you'd want you or your captain spend more time\nTo getting it thanks for your consideration [laughter]\nHonestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley the like do not yet any at\nIt this way he's he's like you know what we're done we're done here we are finished it ... it it it's just great because he didn't seem very standards earlier this week Bernie can send him a letter saying we want a longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back saying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose cabinet\nMeeting all I can change your mind if you had your mind maybe we'll talk about it is just\nIt's amazing so all of that leads up to the fact\nThat there's just a shifting argument going on in like this started off if you recall was an argument that Brett Kavanaugh is unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to write parole and Seventeen and that was the original allegation then it turned into gay rights that turned out to be ... and it turned into until himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it's got angry\nAngry we had an angry people on the court has Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems like in the light\nEvery miner Ginsberg who goes out and ran as RPG touring RPG yeah\nAnd she goes out and she ran politically every five minutes\nShe's perfectly she's perfectly well battle you know the corporate Brett Kavanaugh got mad when you accused him of being a gang rape it doesn't belong on the court the shifting ballpark posts are junk and say here's Hillary Clinton thing Brett Kavanaugh behavior data down well I mean Hillary you want to be president and you break John McCain under a table and throw a lamp that your husband\nServes that hey here's Hillary Clinton wearing again something that she got from ... wardrobe and in New lender\nBut I think for anyone who believes there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with\nUm a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about because\nHe got mad when you accused him of of being ... and I remember someone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that who would that have been accused of sexual assault that's probably true\nI remember somebody getting mad about that oh yeah and she wanted to be president to the United states by the way I should correct led reference ... not ... the dictators and Bob way back to it but we've got you into character from the lander okay how how often the shift that they had to Allison camera on CNN [noise]\nThere's a story about how Brett Kavanaugh back when he was in college gotten a bar fight with a guide to the guy\nNow let me explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds they're a lot of these folks will be senators and the people who are in my class\nAnd there was a group a guy who would go out they invited me but I ... at you all here this is not my type of heart they would go out to bars have got drunk off their boss and then they would just sock each other and then I\nI not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the grind like an actual thing that I Would hear about later as you can imagine not my kind of party had but\nThe accusation here by ... ... throwers are more likely to adult so if you're in a bar fight with due to a bar\nAnd he threw at him then it must be a huge sexually assaulted a woman\nYears prior makes perfect sense makes perfect sense\nAnd when he all the way Alice and Alice in camera out and making a fool of herself\nI think that if you are known as a belligerent main fighting drunk that's relevant I think that it's relevant to then a woman who said you were corner her and putting your hand over her mouth somehow that\nI think makes more sense than if you were just a fun drawn who always fell right into place\nOkay or alternatively the two things don't necessarily have to do with one another because guys getting bar fights with other do and then they may not have when that happened actually a fair but that's where it's like people have never met a man it's it's a it's an incredible incredible thing\nComing up more goalpost shifting from the Democrats Senator Bernie Sanders has a new way of shifting the Gulf Coast is really irritating because let's face it the original allegations those were serious but I'm Sorry allegations that for having a drink

began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always defended capital and always giving credence to the doctor fraud\nAnd he doesn't even acquiesce to Democrats and waiting
