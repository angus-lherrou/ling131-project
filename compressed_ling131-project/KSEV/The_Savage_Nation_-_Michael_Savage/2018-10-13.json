especially in\nA while I'm doing this for everybody was watching us or turn the volume down\nTo put up against\nThat but if you think of all let me get a ... whole play by play and political analysis you're not thinking is that within fault on our White House we're\nNot we're not a sport where you can get it I watch some of that stuff that was so I'm as we want you to stop a there was all but a profound eight weeks there was actually more than you heard we were able to bleach some of it out [noise] uh but there was somebody to make it in there\nOkay mama or you know [laughter] I Wonder ... al ... is just so terrible it was just so awful I mean I Can't believe anything like that has ever happened at the White House flash back just a few years no dog went to the White House you know the great intellectual Snoop Dogg\nHe was the or snoop lion or never he call himself in these days whatever variety of animal from the animal kingdom he calls himself to follow the new\n... new jobs at the White House and you know when he died at the White House here Snoop Dogg talking about how he spoke at the White House and everyone in the media thought this was hilarious\nAnd did you and when you got to hire before the White House did you also then smoke it up a little bit in the bathroom when you were I was trying to get to you every day I see yeah actually I don't do that and nobody and know that I met them what you meant to [laughter] to get him splitting when little some phones\n[laughter] and it was hilarious and funny and\nI think the president\nAnd then it's not hard to know started off as just are not different an office where only great things have happened that's office you know great presidents had was about ... or they tap\nIn his office model is melting that often but I keep coming back to that because again if you're talking about the filing you'll often they're they level beyond having Kanye West there and so the media again ignoring the back of rock bottom was ever present I Love the oh my God how could hold hobnobbing with celebrity athletes to Iraq to the White House\nHere they picture of Jay Z and Beyonce in the situation room\nOne hit you see the photo is a picture of ... and beyond pay in ... and this was just all fun and games was just fun and games because come on dad\nGave him the aren't they great can't go\nCome on\nIt's all fun when it was about it and it was that it was calling you going to the White House and it was just terrible and then you remember that you want to comment on that you remember common is a rapper\nWho hasn't ... song and different without a trick or an actual terrorists in actual terrorists\nAre very was in the White House don't worry it's it it doesn't follow the White House in any way to have nice folks you you know comedy wrapped about supporting terrorism in the White House ... with their economy that night thinking or a magazine that was what was really bad here it's common during the Obama administration\nIt's an honor to be here in the White House library the tiny Desk Concert series has tried to give voice to people who have seen through the culture we move our culture forward and do a movie suffered in that spirit and for music preserves comments ...\nOh yeah then again this was the White House Obama's White House you want to talk about\nIs the dirty little secret about Obama Obama would just much more celebrity driven than Donald Trump original he's the one when President Trump Obama with the Web or the president had no credentials when he became president he turned the White House into basically a revolving door of collaborating he kept during then God and he did it on rape her\nIn Las Vegas with Jay Z and Beyonce so have you on TALK about celebrity in the White House you got to start with ... he was the guy really turned the White House\n... the guy did you call a Dell Dell like the lady who made in a bathtub full of fruit will come on coming up\nThe media obviously hate the ... went to the White House but they've testament stuff about that I just cannot believe we have an air freight on racist stuff coming from members of the media and of course there's no more back because we all get Tanya but it really is rough when life for them to Russia\nA text messaging with rage yeah yeah you know who re days he's\nHe was once close with can car dash and he said I think that is great a great opportunity for young black entrepreneurs an artist to talk one on one with the President's Day and I'd say some American and he goes on to say this but in watching the same from CNN he did say he's a little concerned um there is a concern right now\nIt reaching out to the ex lover\nOf guys wife for comment is I mean is it that is not even be on the downs and journalistic ethics that's on the on the bounds of period and just beyond that that it's raining up that's crazy why in the world would you think that range age has anything unique to offer to the situation except anyone slept with Ken ... that's\nHow they even on CNN like how do you call it on the news network and do that sort of thing that's just the garbage in garbage pickup even worse than that so John Lennon who isn't a disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jay tapper\nVery often tries to be objective and tried to actually do this job done one that had had forsaken all\nRelationship with objectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not an opinion journalists hearing John Lennon\nIn invoking Kanye West's dead mother to attack him\nHis dead mother to attack him door just journalism guy so much and journalists name so much reporting happening right here\nThis was an embarrassment\nConyers mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her for their checks it with one of her friends today from Chicago joined us from I used to live there I Know\nShe can no longer would be ... wouldn't be embarrassed by this\nIs that an okay thing is that something that we're doing now are a lot of technical dead relatives is their dead relatives to attack them not their dead relatives in the tent that like their dead relatives did something wrong but in Tennessee a dead relatives who you didn't know and know nothing about an adult relationship with this man that she would be\nAshamed of him that should be ashamed them Tanya what like\nThat and then I'm Sorry I didn't just sick and the media is over ... reaction to the fact that honey what shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump\n... the media have no one like a black person is that they like President Trump no one because they have violated the attendance an interesting analogy which suggest that we all think like our group we all think like our ethnic group so if you break away from that ethnic group or you break away from that sexual group that you're a gay person who likes from or you're a woman who like from any of those things in your at trader\nAnd John is with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh they were there were ... traders aged giving into the patriarchy made internalize The Handmaid's tale and now we see that with Connie ... he's a black guy who's really wait on the inside of an Oreo right on the black on the outside the white on the inside he he's in the sunken place\nAs people are now saying rented it and that sort of stuff is deeply right and that's why the lesson is so that was ... because he breaks to their rules wanting to black men sports from not allowed\nTo give them the Lebanese reports from also not allowed for people to understand how much from Kate in Hollywood you have to understand that in Hollywood if you even express it remotely right when the end you will never work again\nNever work again I said before I have the Lebanese looking to show their major April I'm not talking April every time talking a plot celebrities who listen to the show and I visited with some of them I've had lunch or breakfast people coming into office were quite famous\nAnd I only tell them do not mentioned that you have been there if you wish to work in a town\nBecause the bias in Hollywood is so extreme that it doesn't matter your side of celebrity if you said even associated with me and I didn't vote for Trump just wanted to gain and he was dating you associated with me just a mainstream conservative and it's pretty reasonable\nAnd that is enough to lose your job like that actually happened out here with marketing clock you just got destroyed red markets law the guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's done a bunch of other issues on um ... the mini project he's on a bunch of other stuff he came in here because he wanted to get a pro gun opinion from somebody\nFor his new movie and they came in and I gave me like an an hour and a half and I tell him don't tell anyone you thing here because you do it will blow back on you and then he thought ... on on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world\nHe was attacked so harshly on Twitter you can lead in the ... and then put up between apologizing for ever having tweeted that I was in I die\nBy apologizing for that that's how it works in Hollywood county has broken to rule you're black man and short hair only paying them and who are black extraordinarily famous person you are not allowed to be pro Trump and you are not allowed to be conservative it anyway you have to total liberal line\nAnd you wonder why you're saying is great shock and dismay Taylor Swift came out and

that I said yeah by the way still a mob still a mob of why I\nMy behavior means it's a mob and and raging and cussing at me\nOver this whole thing just enhances my point further or not a mob huge Jew a mob Eugene next Tuesday you God oh we're not a mob\n\nOh my gosh I had two people telling me yesterday I should be shot because they are not a mob well you showed me the wrong with people\nGood night\nIt's and they are very they don't want to be told that because they know that it freaks out voters and voters are watching\nVoters were watching\nI mean it is it's they see all of how nasty these people are\nAnd Rand Paul was beaten up practically to death in his yard by a Democrat who didn't like his politics hey don't get mad at me get mad at the Kentucky media to report it at you people who are trying to rewrite history [noise] tiny tears I'm just not it's just insane to see this\nAnd you had an employee of Sheila Jackson Lee who was called who was arrested for doc seeing people and even\nPutting their threatened to put their Children's Medical records on line holy cow that's insane\nAnd that and Brian shelter and I let me share with you because this is this is what the media this is how they're trying to finesse and I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with them on a number of things but I always appreciate the discussion\nBut he had said and you know we went back and forth on this a little bit\nBecause I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he said President Trump is leading a hate movement against the press but it's not just against the press what standout stands out to his rallies and he'd quoting this pizza at the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is a too long the column of mice spades inventing it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing as ... to correctly capture their fields at the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to avoid that took it back to the nineties done it and he said\nHe says that he's a recording that says well you know the president's leading hate moving against the crash you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watched his rallies on TV said oh they hate insensitive actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nArab people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about Feinstein and they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run or at a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do\nBut I said people chanting something at a rally in not comparable to stalking people an airport attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging cars docks and families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both right and left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down [noise]\nMm well and that's when I said do you think that this began with this administration or are you purposely ignoring occupy Boston rioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump than would have Hillary Booker and waters and holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for violent\nAnd I added further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left in the right I don't think Republicans have rights to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned when I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the right eye was leaders would work to make things better not worse I said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that they are absolutely people on the left have endured similar but how often and how severe seems out measured\n[noise]\nYou know ... this is is [noise]\nI I I also hope it changes\nI mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides no it's not\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bag hell yeah let's denounced that all day long\nI don't understand the point look here's the thing you can sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got a Home Depot six wins this Sunday I don't care I Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of into I'm totally fine with that\nGo ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech you meet beach you don't like it was more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who was um who would who knew someone\nYou know someone who was um who\nWas who knew someone who knew that the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there [noise] um apparently and this is what I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counterprotesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you have somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so Ann how would that attributed to Trump [noise] yeah and furthermore\nI Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever have condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa they have\nRefused to condemn the protests on college campuses where people ... people in the face and burned down buildings\nSo\nBefore you criticize why don't you match my consistency where other people consistency\n...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps\nMatch it\nBut yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media to tell you that no\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that formed or the KKK\nWould have a PG towards rally in Charlottesville is anybody surprised at that don't believe may go Google at Washington Post wrote about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it is oh condemn it lasts and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it less because it was somebody of their own ideology that didn't that organized it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what does that give you to say the stuff that you're saying well right does it give it when this is this idea that\nAh\nSome I mean just I'm so people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and chatted on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw left is make an effigy of Bush and set that on fire to\nAn your point what's your point\nYou want to do that you know south measuring what about his M. B. S. all day or even actually condemn the people that are shooting up congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidate you voted for or how about this maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know that a person that we voted for\nMaybe she shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable\nRun them out of the country what about Booker or what about I mean I could go on and on what about antifa\nWhat about the students that were in Portland blocking traffic and beating up cars in ... in hitting old people\nWhere the hell are you got any are you people going to get around to condemn and that stuff are you going to hear do well what about this thing here that will that conservative that one person did that conservatives jumped on and they just got to live a living hell what about that\nWhat about you know people are the ones that have a body count and you had a body count since the sixties\nYou know people with what our ground you know people with occupy I Would that's rallies I think people", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "13"}
