justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and family and a half our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you've been forced when you are repeated the tire lines that he and Republicans hope will stick and you're the common touch base with electoral fervor\nThat accusations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh or part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies inception\nThey were and what happened to the cabinet family by like every notion of fairness decency and due process it did\nBut here's Charles Blow perspective to me this was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take the lyrical advantage in the moment the victory it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome has consumed modern American conservatism\nVox has called the unleashing of white male backlash\nIs a very bad by the way white males are not allowed you to find the right to do that just just evidence that they are privilege so if white males\nAre given to profit than that shows that they are public and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that their privilege so just like every other major leftist argument each day the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault weren't the victim instead the white man with the victim well to be accurate the actual accusation that the women are using the white man of assaulting had any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nIn some people's eyes just blows use the victim of political correctness majors overage attractive white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness\nWhich is on which is true because that's what happened but that's not really what is it out according to Charles Blow\nKavanaugh's belligerent defense and Trump's dismissal um the accuser he mocked one and a political rally and called the accusations helps you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said and shouldn't have not Christine Blasey Ford because you didn't know the facts either\nBut according to low and represent for many many back against the wall no more states frustrate moment to fighting back up pushing back a standing crowd in their patriarchy and from claiming that it will not bad\nNow due process it's patriarchy now production of innocent and patriarchy\nLow continued they're saying enough they will see no or ground it will sharing or power he'll accommodate no more than in the end validation of the crap\nOut of the word allegedly a press there because again none of those allegations have actually been supported by any evidence that is what they're telling us and they're speaking through from\nHe says the victims sensibility Trump is articulating it not generationally restricted\nIn January a PR I MTV poll a Fifteen to twenty four year old ... forty three percent of young white men take his grim nation against like your is a problem as discrimination against other groups funky nine percent of young white women agreed with them and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity will harm white people\nBecause by nature the definition of a left at times to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the last one from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience with the left side is that we should give slots\nThat belongs you qualified white people do on while high non white people is an actual point to the left police it\nI don't even know how to lessen argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you are saying that there is a group of college admissions I watch too many are white I mean for a play some of those white people with non white people how does that not harm white people you have to explain that one\nAnd asked for the notion that discrimination against whites is that serious a problem is discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one after away money and accurate way the inaccurate to say that historically and permanently discrimination against black folks\nIs just the ... is not as bad as discrimination against white folks with which I disagree and then there's a way to read it which is that\nAs a home in the left is interested in stopping white dudes because they think that there is a patriarchy that must be punished and patriarchy has to do with the color of your skin and therefore if you are white you don't get to profit that part's true coming up we'll conclude that\nColumbine Charles vote and then we'll get into a deeper question the question of political correctness and whether American Morning when I went to the Russian [noise]\nAccording to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional urge voted conservative and their views are far outside the American mainstream some eight percent of Americans are progressive activists and their views are even less typical by contrast two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority\nAnd I mean most of us and the traditional devoted conservative but I think I Would also probably be a member of the exhausted majority their members shared attentive to feed without polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority and then some dislike political correctness among the general population info eighty percent eighty percent believe political correctness has a problem in our country\nYoung people don't like political correctness Seventy four percent between twenty four and twenty nine Seventy nine percent under age twenty four\nThe walk or any clear minority across all ages race is also a bad proxy\nWhites are less likely than average to believe political correctness has a problem less likely eighty two percent Asian think political correctness is a problem eighty seven percent of Hispanics and clinical correct the problem is eighty eight percent of American indian and political correctness is a problem\nI Love that one ... year old American indian and Oklahoma said that's what it seems like every day you wake up something that change you said you are Jewish is a black eye African American you're on your toes because you never know what to say some political correct led in that sense it's scary\nHe only part of the standard narrative ... data partially from is it black folks in the United states are more likely to support political correctness but three quarters and blacks still opposed political correctness\n[laughter] so it turns out the vast majority of Americans in every racial category are annoyed by the ... crowd and they're just and then nobody ever be offended\nSo Charles Blow take which is that we are allowed to racially polarized so long as we're targeting one political group that's not popular that's not popular\nEighty three percent responded to make less than fifty grand just like political correctness just Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred grand are skeptical about it\nIs that means that the rich or you get the more you like political correctness but not poor people pushing political correctness is minorities pushing political correctness it just proportionately rich white people pushing political correctness\nThat's amazing now there is a political gap here among conservatives Ninety seven percent believe political correct the problem among traditional liberal sixty one percent do the only ones who really really really like\nThe won't culture are progressive accidents only thirty percent the political correctness has a problem there are far far outside of the mainstream so who's in this group according to the Atlantic I loved it\nCompared with the rest of the polling temple progressive accidents are much more likely to be rich highly educated and whites there nearly twice as likely as the average make more than a hundred grand a year they're nearly three times as likely to have a post grad degree and well twelve percent of the overall sample in studying African American only three percent of progressive activists jar\nIts rich white kids rich white kids those are the people who are creating a lot of the problems in our society right now with our talk of divisive polarization and political correctness\nIn one second I'm next plane wasn't sending means by

are they mentally fickle correctness\nAccording to the Lansing and extended interviews in focus groups participants made clear they were concerned about their day to day ability to express themselves they worry that a lack of familiarity with the topic or thinking word choice could lead to Syria social sanctions for them so they're not really sure what it means that they know that they don't like the feeling of restriction had the woke left has created\nBut there's plenty of support for the idea that Americans are not as neatly divided by age or rate and just commonly believe according to appeal only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal nearly half of Latinos argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive Muslims are treated to invite black folks say that I mean immigration outages bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political ads on certain extent is just not true and there is no shrinking white majority that it's going to inevitably lead to liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority had it going\nWe need to liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority and it's going to lead you incredible victory overtime\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we are individuals we are not members of groups that's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left has some serious problems even going forward\nNow that doesn't mean that the right can you think to alienate them the right obviously can do things to alienate shelves and I would say they're the difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is why the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that as offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk and use the N word that's not new being politically correct and you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different ads politically incorrect and you're not being a jerk when I Would recommend that if you actually want to side with that middle of America that it's higher standards that are being made by the left\nBe polite civil and be politically incorrect say things that are actual specifically because their actual and not merely fan I'll leave me you don't have to purposely offend a lot of us will be offended anyway none of it matters\nWhat will only get signed it I just spoke at USC last week and assassinate the young black woman who got attack a question and she's had you been accused of inciting violence and I'd say well you've been hearing the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not the reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me that is why well it turns out that most Americans would rather have disagreement than a few violence and somebody who's not involved in violent and when the less equate speech and violence and\nThen because of their own violence is speech all they're doing it the alienating the vast majority of the American people electric now playing a game the Democratic party playing a game speech of the right and they say is violence because right when they are so bad\nAnd their own violence speech so in the left doesn't pounds on the doors of the Supreme Court and ask threatening that just a form of speech that's just the anger according to CNN but if folks on the right to say that offends people that's now form of violence on CNN headline news when I managed a man and woman is a woman\nAnd some transgender woman grits me by the back of the neck and threatens me bottle bodily harm those two things are equivalent me take advantage of man or woman as a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing physically on national television and threatening to send me home in an ambulance which is literally what happened the left\nIs engaged in in its really polarized singing and most Americans don't bite and\nThat's what we found out in the Trump ... in front of their most Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that Trump's going to win from here to eternity it doesn't mean that Republicans always when Republicans are not good at this game they're not and again when you mistake political incorrect for being a jerk or vice versa you're making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that the notion unless at the woke majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true statistically and that's a very very important thing to keep in mind\nWe still have more in common than than not and you can be fooled by watching our politics are watching social media I got a little too\nBut it's not reality I mean speaking of folks are not living in reality there they leaked report from Google was leaked to Breitbart and it's just an amazing report\nJump right Barbara ... and internal company breathing

simple I haven't my hands the California criminal jury instruct on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to a defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nReally amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves and what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug\nHere was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down for just in Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you know what's going on and I want to stop the mayor this before it

that are wrapped in a rapper and in the oval office [noise]\nAircraft rent [noise] Frank Sinatra can\nHas but I had hoped to president would elevate our cultural standing rather than having a great our cultural standing and to me bringing a rap star in any rap star denigrate American culture doesn't raise it up slows down\n[noise]\nAnd I'm not speaking from jealousy I've been there at the same desk\nI I've been I've been at the same desk the ... the highest point in my in my career\nSo I'm not speaking to the point of view of jealousy I'm speaking to the point of view or something else something is wrong with this picture who is inviting the president to bring in a rap star who makes it the grace\nOf the oval office this was a sacred office that is owned by the people Trump does not own that office he's merely an occupant of it\nHe has no right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are\nIn my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree with me just that disagree with me but this is part of the cultural degradation that I have been trying to talk about for twenty five years on the radio and everything I'm Talking about it for the point of view jealousy or mistaken again I'm a best selling author I'm an extremely successful broadcaster\nMy current book is doing extremely well thank you audience very much you want to thank you for making it happen a I Hope you get onto a policeman for free as a gift\nBut I've been in the oval office it was a big moment for me do you think I Would jump up and hugged the president do you think I Would think it was not a violation of\nCommon sense decency\nA secret service rules to jump up and give the president decides hug like he's the guy on the body shop somewhere in Bay on the Jersey what are you thinking\nI'm surprised by the way that the secret service is so bad that this could by the way they should not have been I shouldn't have happened\nNumber one but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent or would have prevented the rapper from grabbing the president's I'd look at the president's faith in the picture he's extremely shocked he's horrified by the way that the guy got so close to him do you understand how dangerous this is what a per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grabbed a screen shot up without having to put a areas wrap it violates Secret Service protocols that's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm wrong look at the president's face he shocked\nHe shot the man's got him in a hug where he's got his left arm over the president's\nA left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the president really backwards from him and they're cutting us making the big ass of himself again marking to the cameras using that President as a marketing tool do understand that\nWell if you don't understand them and help you try to understand that this was a public relations disaster\nAnd what is he going to get ... votes from it\nYou know on Monday I'm going to have a diamond in silk on the show again because in the movie is coming out\nI'd be very curious where they think about this\nBecause this goes way beyond the optics of the picture\nThis goes to a breakdown in our society and almost every level nobody seems to have any values left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north knows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you turn everything's breaking down for the top to bottom that's that's that's my opinion\nThat's my opinion rosy rose on line three you disagree with all had please you're on the air [noise]\nYes Hi I'm calling every car bomb attack Hi Nate ... five that packet and for the the fact that I see as a member of any part of the United states I don't I don't write for a government and so it was a garbage man the ah not\nReally so what sort of garbage man has a right to be in the oval office\nThe president if I send the file\nLet us know what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big company following morale at pornography pornographic websites are amongst the biggest Web sites in the country would it be right for the president to invite the head of a pornography website in targeting west it's nothing but a pornographer with an instrument\nLike a ... a five\nHour thanks for agreeing with me I've been waiting for that to all my life not a ... you don't understand this was pushed down a by someone else in there who got it all wrong and I don't think the president's going to gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we're defending him and defending American values aboard his language and culture while you could argue that rap music is part of American culture you'll be right in saying that but I Would say is in the wrong direction he's taking America in the wrong direction of culture\nA and I don't care about race that oh you are making racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all it's on your mind I Would say this if it was a person of any any any race and if he wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting\nDisgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion maybe I'm a first and the only wanted to say it today but I can guarantee you won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper I Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come\nTo me ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy extras he actually ecstasy\nEcstasy she pushes drugs he pushes groups acts he pushes ah everything you could imagine that we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office I can read more leverage if you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all disgusting lyrics\nAnd this is an example of the the the collapse of American civilization\nAnd by the way I felt the same way with his darling wife was in their last a few months ago another one zero nobody an uneducated piece of a waste of human DNA human DNA was brought into human DNA a waste of human DNA excuse me\nNothing much surgery a a surgical textbook in high heels was brought in and I'm supposed to sitting like a moron and say how wonderful that he brought in the wife of the rap and now he brings in the rapper whose X. Y. pornographer bringing up pornographer after all and some of these sites are doing their enormous\nWhy do you think you're sick the guy from the desert who has a a all\nAre enormous why does he just sick the guy from the desert who has a uh all of the ... the um how's the prostitution a desert that guy dentist whatever's layman's after all he's running as a Republican what had happened when they were getting ... dog what's that guy's name and what the what the uh the Brussels out there in the desert of of the route to\nSay that he represents American culture to you could have him in your why not\nHave a boss alone or have a pornographer and they may bring in six votes each you never know what I Would think that having had a guy who runs like one of the major porn sites would be very smart politically I think of all the people addicted to pornography will vote for Trump after that\nWas the same thinking as having this guy in there at least that's my opinion I run a shorter time I'll be back\n... joy laws several ...

[noise]\nThis is hurricane Michael brought in apparently mosquitoes five times as normal size of like a regular mosquitoes their fight is like being sad with a needle\nWhy do we have this why do these exact\n\nI always had the range with pretty loaded max but it's amazing how fast you can go through all those around there's nothing more aggravating and having to stop and reload everything when you get into a good read them you know when you find your focus and concentration and you're just really on top of acquiring your target and you want to get right back into it instead of having to stop\nAnd reload and that the administration of work and what I call it\nTake a look at your old speed letters and be honest about it they will go lane compared to ... this was literally the fats this letter in the world and if you doubt me for even a second you got to go to ... dot com\nAnd see the video for yourself for thirty bucks is the best money you can spend on the range and I'm telling you from personal experience once you have this ATS loader you're never going to load the same way again load on the whole mag in less than three seconds\nAnd it turns out that the originated in country bands the shipment of fish and plastic so you've just violated a foreign law or the lazy act the late there by the way is what they tried to get gives them guitar with\nYou remember that Gibson guitar was completely fine when it was importing rose would for its board and they argument under the previous administration was that they were in violation of delete the act which they were not and it was trying to pack them with a number of felonies\nThis was when I first heard about this book because I was like this sounds like they're really trying to drum up something and that's when I started looking into steaks and like how the hell is that a felony and I went in and started looking at the um so and so anyway you own a small business you are important says just say it's a seafood restaurant\nSo you got 'em your shipment and it comes it comes in plastic and sort of cardboard boxes so that that violated a foreign law for the country of origin\nSo as a result ... under that act\nIt's unlawful to import export cell acquire a purchase fish wildlife are plants that are taken possess transported are sold in violation of us are Indian law in interstate commerce involving fish wildlife are planes taking possessed are sold in violation of state or foreign law that states actual writing\nThis actually happened to three American seafood dealers asked a that had no prior records\nThey were this was back in two thousand and one they were trying to pack them for importing lobster tails that were the wrong side of the package and clear passage plastic bags rather than cardboard boxes and they sentence them to um I ... in total or ten years in prison\nBy the way do you know if you take a fix that day that could be actionable you know that\nOkay so yeah this was the Supreme Court actually had to go back into men to the statute\nBecause it was so vague so for instance say that\nYou would you would never do because we're all responsible people\nSay that you you know you've got two tickets to you know playoffs or something and you you if you want to be able to take the day off work because the seats are amazing you know you're not going to be able to get the chance again so you called and you say you're sick um but apparently that is described as quote a scheme or artifice to fraud\nAnd the ... the company of their quote intangible right to your honest services which can be arguably arguably a federal crime\nAnd the statute which show unbelievably vague that a couple of years ago the Supreme Court had to get involved and actually mended to apply only to bribes or kickback because it would show and that's not the only one that that statute that's insanely vague like that\nOr it was so ambiguous even Justice Scalia who was out of the show on the bench when this was when they were a remedy and they said that criminalizes equipped criminalizes a salaried employees funding in sick to go to a ball\nGame right\nThere was um for instance back in Nineteen Ninety six here's another one there was a well known automobile rates are Bobby answer he got lost in the woods essentially he got convicted of a federal crime he was sentenced to six months in prison because he got lost in a blizzard in Colorado for two days watched wild snowmobile and\n... and he was guilty of quote unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a national forest wilderness area and he didn't know he was in the wilderness area because he had gotten lost in the middle of the flipping blizzard that the felony\nYou understand what I'm saying how the ... de classification of felonies has been expanded to the point where you can't even keep track of it anymore\nWhich was the basis beyond you know that book you could even get into the media like for instance James Rosen a friend of mine who were there James rising who reports from New York Times and James Rosen who reports for Fox stupid progressive don't understand the difference and they can play them and think that the same person whenever this comes up\nSo if you will I did was under the espionage in censorship act which is because it's it's\nVague um in terms of\nHow it can be enforced and this was when the Obama administration and the holder department of justice went after Eric Holder because he had several contact within the state department\nAnd he wrote a story and it wasn't actually like a scoop or anything it was just about how North Korea was testing nuclear or whatever and he wrote a story about it and it and it loosely pertains to national security\nAnd so as a result the administration didn't like it so they persecuted him under the espionage and censorship act because he was protecting has chores\nAnd show 'em they said that he violated espionage laws and it even judgment call a ton of its end quote this was the first time that the federal government has moved to this level of taking ordinary reasonable traditional lawful reporter skills and claiming they constitute criminal behavior\nNow do you want to know something else that can be considered\nA felony because we're talking about how you know who you have ... who's at the White House and he's talking with the president and one of the things he's discussing the criminal justice which this administration has done more than the previous on criminal justice and I hope that I we need to do more for instance\nAnd I'm giving you an example of how so many ridiculous things are classified it's felonies now I think felonies should be limited to certain awful crimes because now everything's a damn felony and when you think of forfeiture of your rights\nFelony I mean you're talking about one of the things that constitutes that ... that that classification is if you know the the penalty is improvement over a year or more well then that's a forfeiture writes your prohibitive disaster so for instance check this out\nIf you um switch jobs or you leave your old fear place of employment if you tell your friends and family cannot use them\nThat could be a phony not even getting Computer Fraud and abuse law that's actually happened before\nComputer Fraud and abuse law\nThat's actually happened before and two thousand Britain again they'll start sixteen months in prison because he alerted customers of his old company tornado development about a software problem that was never fixed he explains that the company email system had a flaw that could allow an attacker to gain access to users email records\nProsecutors argue that he had damage their system wired magazine said he was quote ... that the jailing was uh uh they wrongly jailed a security whistle blower\n[noise] I mean this is crazy I can sit here and go on and on and on and on and on and on\nThere are there are so many ways that little bitty things I mean it isn't over criminalization epidemic and this is why we need criminal justice reform\nLike for instance did you know Twenty one USC section for sixty one uh and subject a subsection three eighty one point one seven one do you make it a crime itself turkey ham as ham turkey or with the words turkey and ham and different font\nThere's a whole crime there's a whole Twitter account out there called a crime a day that lists all the insane felonies this is what I'm Talking about when I say we ... we got to have criminal justice reform\nBecause and this is just one example by the way I could get into you know I could we could talk about in prison that we could talk about white collar crimes we could talk about drug why we could get into a whole bunch of it but I'm just giving you this overview oh do you know\nI'm at sixteen USC ... a section five five fifty one subsection to sixty one point sixteen the make it a crime to wash official farms that if it's not a fish washing faucet international for us\nTo know that ...\nThese are all felonies the ... the department of justice back in the eighties attempted to count the total number of federal crimes and they can't yeah yeah or for instance did you know it's a felony Eighteen us the section eight and sixty five subsection seven point nine six to be a three make it a federal crime to harass a golfer at any national park in Washington DC\nMhm yeah how 'bout that\nHere's what about that say that you want to go on vacation how many people live on a vacation and if you have a dog you take your dog with you on vacation\nWhere am I one of the things I Would love to do is go to our national parks but I wanted to get my whole ... my my whole or a family so and dogs included well I have to be careful that I didn't violate any a federal laws I Would have to make sure\nThat I didn't commit a felony with my pet you want to know how so Eighteen USC\nEighteen sixty five subsection to point Fifteen a for making a federal crime to let your ... your pet making noise that scared the wildlife international park\nUh-huh mhm\nHow about this said that you are saying that you visit your going to White House store how amazing right you get to go in the White House tore you go you know maybe you toward the Capitol Grounds you get to go and you're you're going around taking pictures and this happens all the time you inadvertently turn around in a weird way and you end up bumped into table in a land fall off the table\nAnd you you scratch the land for you break the lamp something well [noise] you just violated a federal law [noise] forty us the section eight one oh three\nB. for it's a federal crime to injure a government on land\n\nYeah you see what I'm Talking about well how are these in existence so they're definitely a place to start this is just one example and then I can\nSit here and tell you about how in California I've read stories on this program about how there than pedophiles I've gotten western treatments\nAre lesser penalties and people who have a couple of ounces of pot on them and I'm not a I'm not like the big marijuana pot pusher person I just want the government to leave me alone and be consistent and your application of law I was just thinking maybe being a pedophile the little you know what I'm saying\nYeah this was like five years ago but I
