president of the United states\nHas announced that in an interview that he has an interest in in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrant children so here in the way the law currently operate it you come to the United states for virtually an apartment or a foreign diplomats\nYou kind of the United states they have a baby in the United states that maybe it's automatically a citizen of the United states and title to All right and privileges conferred upon all citizens of the United states the reason that the ... a controversial issue because nothing in the constitution actually that the game\nNot only there's nothing in the constitution actually the case\nThere's pretty good evidence that the frame or isn't the fourteenth amendment had no intent to do anything remotely like it suggest that just because you come to the United states and then you have a navy hear your baby is now the United states citizen and that does have some pretty significant cost\nInvolved right now you have in California in many stories about that you had situations where legitimate birth tourism is happening people are travelling\nYou've had situations where legitimate ... birth tourism is happening people are traveling to the United states just to have babies in the United states is that their kid become American citizens and there's some pretty significant impact\nThe center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration and they estimate that between three hundred and four hundred thousand children are orange illegal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birds in the United states to any legal and grandmother\nAll of those children are considered by the executive branch of government US citizens enjoying came right and privilege at\nAt least the children of us citizens the population of U.S born children with illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two point three million in two thousand three to four million in two thousand eight and that's not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older than the actual figure\nIt's actually somewhat larger all of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizens\nThere's a lot of talking about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact\nOn the American economy because of legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example their children however are not and that does lead to chain migration because children are now us citizens and they can sponsor their parents for the United states citizenship Center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy and take greater efforts in barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduced cost because the kids are still American citizens nationwide forty percent of the illegal alien hot headed households received some type of welfare in some states the rate is higher\nIn New York forty nine percent receive welfare and California forty eight percent only Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizens make use of the major welfare program in other words illegal alien who have\nAmerican citizen children are taking advantage welfare and its

surrounding the fourteenth amendment there's\nOne Supreme Court case that does suggest that the children of illegal immigrant aren't jak it ends up the United states the case in Nineteen eighty two is very ... and they were only to try to catch this case made famous by very loud Supreme Court case basically was about whether the state of Texas could you not educational benefit\nTo children of illegal immigrants\nSo kids were born in the United states they were the children of illegal immigrants and the question why do they actually have to be given free public education at the cost of date set of Pakistan now the Supreme Court said yeah that was left that elected Supreme Court there's no evidence that this is really accurate or the the good ruling\nJustice William Brennan a very leftist judge\nWrote in a footnote quote no plausible sanction with respect to fourteenth amendment jurisdiction can be drawn between resident alien to the end France the United states was lawful and resident alien who's entry was unlawful well that obviously is bull crap okay we make sanctions along those lines all the time all the time we are constantly making a legal distinction\nBetween resident alien cooking her lawfully and written inhale entertainer unlawfully like for example if you're a resident alien you came around ... can deport you enter America law if you're a resident alien came her lawfully we cannot to a bar you\nUnder American law and we now have some sort of violation so this is simply a nonsense opinion now\nJust because it's nonsense opinion does not mean that it does not have some sort of a legal standing adopt\nAnd the fact is that there is a legal standing or four ply alert versus yeah but that means that when President Trump said that he can simply issue an executive order and overall that Supreme Court ruling or overrule the federal laws that have taken that have taken part in a in in order to ensure the quote unquote rights of children of illegal immigrants\nThat not correct and accurate might be able to do it maybe not in any case it was going to go to the Supreme Court and that's really what this is all about President Trump signed an executive order and then this is going to be litigated all the way to the top of the Supreme Court at which point the Supreme Court will would rule and all but now\nIt's really going to do all of us who knows\nAnd when he talks on the left are very very upset about from talking that that could have ordered this way I don't like executive orders this way either I don't think is what the executive branch should be doing executive branch does not have any power nor the you'd have the capacity to rewrite log or rewrite the constitution I felt that way about ...\nRewriting the law simply suggest she was not going to prosecute illegal immigrants and I don't like it when President Trump that he can rewrite the laws are productive birthright citizenship from the office of the president gave\nThe president is not a king executive branch is not a monarchy what is this really about what is the truth that the president and he wants to pursue something like that you got to have a Republican Congress you could push Congress for a while he does have a Republican Senate he can push the Senate for law\nWhich is really about joining up to date in advance to the twenty eighth collection and it ties into what President Trump\nKey argument has always been with regard to immigration on all the way that you want to get into nicotine which is that we are far too night now the legal immigration in this country now there are a lot of folks are suggesting that his rhetoric with regard to the caravan is over the top in some ways\nIt's accurate and there's so much now I Want to be buried like hands you about the president and his credit when it comes to\nHIV treatment of its migrant caravan\nThe migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt I mean there's just no question that that's what it is it's being promulgated and push by Central American Latin American government being pushed\nBy the government of Mexico which is allowing ... to travel towards the United states or when the president said that these are not those who are eligible for asylum is basically correct asylum is for people who are being targeted by a government it's not for economic migrants who simply\nWant to cross over into the United states in order to take advantage of the economic benefit I'm living a rich and powerful country that that are getting invasion it's not an invasion when you walk up to a point venturing out first Iowa\nAnd he overall rhetoric with regard to illegal immigration\nIs not useful you can even oppose birthright citizenship unconstitutional and and moral ground about what you shouldn't do it to ... that the United states is an imminent doom and they're all from cows than people who are walking up the point of entry at the southern border because that does raise capital in a way that seemed inaccurate\nBut we need to be at least somewhat circumspect in how we approach these issues even though I generally on President Trump's side of the legal immigration issue so coming up let's talk about the\nRhetoric surrounding this migrant caravan of lessons made the case that President Trump's rhetoric on the migrant ... is what drove the shooting at a Pennsylvania Canada we'll analyze that claim and talk about the relationship rhetoric violent [noise]\nAnd when that happened in social fabric actually the case that the biggest problem that teacher you know like kept on saying you write speech for Bloomberg today and what you said the Trump hateful speech raises the risk of violence\nIt the the one sided focused on President Trump's speech as opposed to the left speech is counterproductive if we want to say let's all take it down and I'll take the ...\n... I agree with but if you want to say that from uniquely responsible for the tone in general American political debate right now that's just not accurate it's just not accurate and you know it's not accurate\nI mean we generally and the last twenty four hours a Republican Party headquarters and blues account in Florida need the windows were shot out here's footage from that\nJust walked in the coming through the back\nDoor and they sell the windows and\nDid not have time at that point to around [noise]\nAnd then um I didn't realize there\nWas gunfire but there's one bullet holes in our windows and therefore blue and homeless out in the room\nAnd so the idea that violent rhetoric is only happening on one side it's just a lot there's another problem I suggest thing that rhetoric is is deeply connected with violence and that is you come into censorship\nSo there is a threat in saying that rhetoric is directly connected with violence here is a threat the threat is that people will men and say okay let's restrict the rhetoric that's restricted return and that's the move that being made in for example Europe and the NATO I'm right now I'm I'm broadcasting from Vancouver to move is being made in Canada\nIn Europe and there's a case has been wildly under under covered in Europe\nThere is an amazing amazing case in which a woman was fine for criticizing the prophet Muhammad and this is this is the new description of the case from the Atlantic rambling writes a few years ago I if you're gonna live Egypt and television show hosted by conservative Muslim jihad sympathy he learned early on by offering to answer any question I had about Islam including he said\nWhat is the president whether the prophet Muhammad was a child molester those seemed awfully open minded I talking how humans jihad it tends to be at a profit\nWhen the lights went out in the program again I mentioned the challenger issue has remained true to his word that diversity into racial chiding me from my apartment\nAround the same time a woman referred to as ... was convicted in Austria for in effect not praising identical curiosity and for a little question on Thursday the European Tour of human rights I held her two thousand eleven conviction for discouragement a religious precepts\nA crime in Austria in fact what yet that are not in ... she held seminars and when she presented her view that Mohammed ... to travel after\nDominant monitor nations hold them a hundred and third wife I shot was taken the time of the American nine at a confirmation Mohammed was in his early fifties\nThe Austrian woman or if you didn't these claims the Austrian court rules you had to pay four hundred and eight year olds or spend sixty days in jail\nAnd the ISI HR ruled Austria and not violated her right this is a consequence of restricting these because you believe that speech either leads to violence or violence there are consequences on the other side of the equation it's not all about\nRhetoric and violence are connected there or take down the rhetoric there is a problem with saying rhetoric and violence are connected and therefore we must restrict the rhetoric so be very careful about what it is that we are calling for here\nWe have to be very careful because we're not careful then the impact of that is going to be a lot worse than the actual disease itself I mean just a second\nI Want to talk about anti Semitism about the media is radical rhetoric when he gets all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your underwear due to\nFall is here and you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade our reach Dr drawers with only fall colors in print\nFrom Tommy John and he's already bats underwear in the business Tommy John upset over every little detail on stage is proprietary habits to perform like nothing is ever more before as a result Tommy Young men and women's underwear for to know what you're guaranteed what helped me in high school\nComfortable separately stands and a range of ... federal injurious often either light moisture wedding\nReasonable ... what do you not against you that means no bunch and you know riding up Tommy John so confidence in their underwear that if you don't love your first ... you know full refund but they're bacterial everywhere or it's free guarantee\nSo what do you have to lose that includes that white changing women's underwear which is now pulling back and stop before you spend another time on cheap heat trapping multi past underwear remember there's no better way to take care of your good Tommy John no judgment needed hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now from called Ben for twenty percent off your first or\nA prominent goes on for twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com\nI Love it these underwear and you will to and again there's no risk because they've got that bacteria level whereas free guarantee Tommy John dot com I Want to talk about the polarization and I'm One of the reasons that lying about the level of of rancor on the other side by whitewashing itself the bad idea\nI have to get the kid is four and a half and to me now to\nFour and a half year old is just a wonderful beautiful girl she definitely Cannes up or something the two and a half year old has now decided he's had enough and so he's going to harass her\nEvery waking minute of every single day and we as parents have to decide exactly how we're going to treat that now the media response is it when he pushes her and she screamed in his face which is basically\nEvery hour or two in our house right now do you I\nSimply punish him or not punish are also the answer is what I Do they paid him you need to go aircraft right now right you get a timeout you're allowed to put your sister and I said her me up when you have a problem I Need you to come and talk to me about it I Need you to and you could actually talk man standing right here you don't need a screaming and said there is not already ... to ... which you can appeal\nAnd screaming and his faith or pushing him back and it's not the proper solution to this I'm now\nIt's more responsible and she has you back of course yeah\nWe're pushing him back is not the proper solution to this I'm now\nIt's more it's possible and she is of course yeah of course yet writing pushing her\nBut that doesn't mean that you got to act like rational screaming Hussein is pushing back up and do any of those things right now in American politics here's Apple's are knowing people on the left seat themselves and my daughter\nPeople in the right you don't tell my daughter everybody feels like they are being pushed by the other side and they feel like it's okay to screen back in that person's face\nNobody is saying yeah I'm being pushed by the other side and that's bad but also I shouldn't screaming anybody can put it that\nMaybe what I should do instead is appealed to the broader moral authority of the American people and not act like that\nYeah the the media and the same for a long time president something needs to stop paying the price on the enemy of the people that President from I I got a lot of blowback yesterday exact weeded out at President Trump should not say that the media are the enemy of the people a lot of books on the Internet do you mean the fake news or the enemy of the people\nI Would buy that narrative except that President Trump has never been very clear about what constitutes the fake news now there's something I think is that news\nThat there are people who are on all journalists who are actually jak opinion makers there are actual headlines that are wrong that's fake news but the president has been a blunder in his use of the term fake news\nThere was a poll he doesn't like fake news and there's a story and he doesn't like it's fake news\nHe's never actually been very good about objectively than what it's like news and when it's not so I'm not going to buy that exact excuse\nThe ... the scene of president shouldn't say that Trump and functions and the press or the enemy of the people that is true also true the media should not portray President Trump as the enemy of the people once they have been doing literally since the day he was elected and before they think he's a Russian agent they say that he's a traitor the country\nAre you doing all of this for his own personal enrichment without any evidence to this point\nThey say all of these things and then they think OK well our hands are clean our hands are clean and you can see the sort of attitude you want to know what folks are angry at me on the right and one of the reasons the folks are angry at the other I heard Joe McCosker\nGoing after Sarah happen again or is on the\nWhich was a very new in the frozen from\nIs going to save a fake news radio or the enemy of the people\nWho were just saying there's it's really easy to say that there are some ... some news outlets in\nThis country or for the ... but he should\nOr should we have ... states which outlets which journalists for the envy of\nOkay and really what you should say is I mean what Trump things it's huge costs are I mean that that's what the obviously running through their out and you can read his head she stuck between a rock and a hard place because at the Packer Terry you don't want to start labeling people enemy of the people it's like from shouldn't be using the phrase\nBut if you're talking about fake news right I mean I think the gym I talked to is is not a good journalist I think just as objectively speaking as I can be I think ... the lump sum him a cop that using cells in accidents more than a journalist\nAnd it's obvious to everyone CNN then tweeted out and it's not clear how come you can't or you said that he that I'm ... went out to make as you said you guys are polarized debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and bombing\nCNN communication that no press secretary in and did not say Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bombs into our office by darkening than involved in support\nWe didn't say that he as you should understand words matter every single one of them but so far\nYou don't seem to get that had to lie CNN has been saying for a week for a week at function you taking responsibility for the money you know I read you the kind of around like last week for a whole segment and CNN and hosts people like Julie ... is this radical journalists political journalists from GQ\nWho went on CNN yesterday and then said that Trump radical ideas more people than it does\nThis president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the way he talks the way the way he is that's just how the way the way that he uh allow things in the way he went to not to these groups the way he says I Know I'm not spoken\nTo and what she says right there in San Antonio and she actually had to come back and quality apologized or let's not pretend and heated rhetoric and the escalation of moral ... on the other side that that hasn't taken place on both sides you absolutely have coming up\nThe ... synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh written some serious questions about anti Semitism like why is it how do we analyze it and how fast can we fight and I think there are multiple different use what anti Semitism and we need to actually examine them and then\nWherever you find their voice am somewhat Hubbard all used to\nOf those [noise]\nThose as our town hall dot

them in order to let them all and I mean they are poor\nAnd you felt for the propaganda of the AMA Goldman statement on the statue of liberty which has been there since the early Nineteen hundreds were to give me your tired your poor your hunger knows you're earning to be free it sounds great now my grandfather came through Ellis Island I'm sure he may have heard about that give me your tired your poor your hungry\nAnd those yearning to be free but you know there was a different to them\nThat I'm trying to get through to you there's a big difference between now and then\nThat I'm trying to get through to you there's a big difference between now and then and the differences there was no welfare state then there were no food stamps the ACLU wasn't even a glimpse in the eye of the

the sort of an immigrant very important points for you to remember the fact of the matter is the literacy rate of America has plummeted since Obama opened up the floodgates to a third world those who are illiterate in their own language\nAnd it's just something I cannot emphasize enough we're not even bringing in people who are literate in their own language their illiterate in their home country most of them could out read or write in their own language do you know that\nAre you aware that we are calling from the bottom of all of societies on earth we're not taking\nEven moderately educated people from these countries to come here with some literacy we are getting people in who have no literacy how does that set up for this nation [noise] you know I don't care if you're a progressive

back on the news this is also by the way to the network that sets Fox is dividing us\nBut the network at you just heard all of this on as mad because they they Fox's dividing us\nIn fact CNN Business had a tweet earlier today it says quote the Pittsburgh suspect I've got a talking point that dominated Fox News airwaves and discussing the caravan although remember ah the edges so stupid it just the dumbest thing ever they have then uh and then I also\nResponded to Bryan shelter about this as well and they pulled us out they have a couple of things here I thought that this is I'm quite fascinating ah Brian filter said I Hope Fox News is doing some soul searching and dividing the country\nYou remember the town hall that your network hosted Brian when do you well remember that I mean I Love the network at Fox is dividing the country or something but also he radicalized that people just like I said wow same network same exact Fifteen distribute cigarettes yeah\nYeah exactly and I mean this isn't the did not the only individuals who are who are saying things like this in terms of ah well the the president by the way audio somebody twenty nine the president responded a and I'm going to play I'm going to play ... or this president responded to eye off saying that he radicalized or more people than ISIS with him\nFor ... for some kind of a ship woman French and the enemy of

I mean this is just a\nKnow I just can't it's just it's all\nCrazy I Want to um this is Brian shelter by the way in discussing and trying to blame all of this no remember that comments which the president was responding was on CNN this is Brian ... who is making a statement that it's you know it's really it's Fox News it's doing all the dividing\nListen scary stories about illegal immigration and railed against Democrats he's in Fox News pundits mode president mode\nHe makes the crowd angrier [noise]\nNext day Saturday the president rightly sweet it about the evil attack and fix for each other we must unite to conquer hey [noise]\nSo whether you're going to start well I don't\nKnow your network ... you're the president of CNN blamed him for a\n... uh the the bombings Dave de de ... said that they were quote attacks\nOn Trump's targets are you guys have been spreading along with other networks and other pundits and people who are associated the whole quote unquote matter bombers situation I don't recall any one having that same\nReaction when it was a Bernie ... who shot up a ball field or people who are on the left who decided that they were going to turn right turn out or I Love by the way to spend that I saw from CNN recently when they said that the gunshots into ... county Republican office we're just quote vandalism in quote\nUm I don't see that being treated that particular way um but I Do find it ironic that a network that went to lecture everyone else about tone held a town hall where people were screaming burn her\nAnd we're trying to get up on the stage and a network where are they allowed everyone who day they did everything that they could to inflame passions passing passion to the breaking point purposefully\nSo that they could get the most viewers which is why I had very harsh words for that network pointedly and other networks that would behave in such a fashion the day after\nA this is a network that they routinely use the ... the guise of journalism to go after and try to settle scores with people politically and I'm not saying that any network is free from that but what bothers me is that they pretend to be objective while they do it and that's\nThe thing that I find most concerning no one believes that you're being objective at least when people on Fox or editorial I mean they come out and they say that they're conservatives and they really don't leave any any ... any they settled whatsoever to assume otherwise but the problem is that there are so many people on\nA with CNN that take effect and I know because I used to work there\nOr they take offense\nTo the assumption that they are editorializing or that they are part is an or that they do have an opinion either way\nThey believed that they believe the lie that they are somehow bipartisan an air preventing things and it completely objective manner and that just simply isn't the case now no one expect people to not have any opinion out all whatsoever about the news but\nWhen you choose other individuals namely your competitors of editorial I think things and they've all we've been up front and honest about it\nWhile simultaneously denied that you yourself to the same thing while also preventing this ally of objective is to readers and to viewers as a way to get them to think that what you're doing his actual objective journalism when in fact that no better than editorial invasion\nThan we have a problem we have a problem with with a jet with with being disingenuous we have a problem with honesty and we have a problem with consistency\nThat's what this is\nAnd it's not just CNN audio somebody twenty six\nNow\nAnd it's not just CNN audio somebody twenty six sneaker resent ski\nGoodness she also chimes in on that with him\nStop it or hold it\nActually has a point you in on a show with a media companies said is spreading the white nationalist y y and Z about leprosy lives about small pox lied about the others invading the\n... to take a look Arab ally I'm white nationalism you can ... sauce news programs and they saw his house\nOh my goodness that is so crazy so that's where they are for money what rate what what place\nAre they in by the way I don't know I I don't know I um [noise] oh goodness I and again they were just lecturing about tone\nIt isn't steps in attempt to say well I simply just like\nWhat you're saying because you are a\n\nWell you would go to ... you're a racist and a white nationalist\nDoes doesn't it just doesn't work well for the laugh when they do win engaged and things like this\nThis doesn't just doesn't help anybody by the way there is even more uh the Washington Post Max Boot blamed right wing media for domestic terrorism Oh yes Oh yes oh there's more but wait there's more Florida Senator Bill Nelson compared the current political climate in the United states to Rwanda\nBefore a genocide that killed up to one million people in the Nineteen nineties\nGoodness we have more there's more [noise]\nIt keeps on going and a left wing billionaire Tom Sawyer runs it ran a Facebook ad where he compared Trump to Saddam Hussein\nWhat\nOh any also compare them to uh you go ... which really\nI ... you know he was a socialist right\nAnd he just gets it gets more and these are all people who are simultaneously lecturing about tone their lecture and about tone over and over and over\nWhile engaging in this well Joe Lieberman he finally had enough of all of this stuff from the media and everyone else and he decided he was job\nHe was on I think they're suppose he was brought on finally was he was on CNN and he pushed back the a\nFormer Democratic vice presidential nominee wasn't buying it he was on CNN CNN John ...\nWho was very trying very very hard Monday morning to get everyone on his panel to denounce trumpet some sort of murder in fire as a as amused for murderers\nAnd\n... a liberal and wasn't having a new busters has the transcript\nHe he said that the president's campaign attacks on George Soros ah we're all about anti Semitism which is essentially saying that any attack on me it just means you hate women\nLogically it's the thing we're going to completely nullify your actual concerns and make it all about identity politics so as to take you out of the need and leave you nothing to stand on because the if they can if they can paint you as an anti Semite then you can't disagree with anyone anymore because you're tainted good\nSo let's forget that he supports horrible policies and let's forget all of that if you you were going to cut you cannot disagree with anyone who ... the so by that logic anyone who disagrees with me hates women hates them and\nProbably wants them to die the same logic [noise] so this is basically what was the justice to Joe Lieberman stupidly suggested to Joe Lieberman that anyone who criticizes Soros as an anti Semite\nAnd\nHe was asked do you believe that there are those who receive those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see one of the ads have his campaign or a John George Soros et cetera ominous pictures talking about the money and all of\nThat doesn't that's into it doesn't that send a message but Lieberman wasn't buying it and he says what he goes I\nOkay so I'm drawing you often emily's and John you're going to soccer dad soccer practice

such as banks refusing to cash checks cash being confiscated from innocent citizens and much much more don't call now eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six\nThe biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men or we have to start doing something about them what did you mean by doing something about them round up white males put white males in jail for a white males out of the country what does he mean so now if you're a guy in the bottom\nAnd you're sitting there listening to this you say I'm not going to take this anymore and then something bad happens and that's why a TNT has a responsibility in social responsibility to the United states of America to give peace a chance it's that simple\n\nNow if you want to comment on this go at K. and civil Jennifer ... go ahead you're on the Savage Nation\nDr Savage thank you for getting my husband a platform he's not here to talk to you personally that he is a white male half Hispanic half white and he was a police officer for Thirty years and he is ready to\nSit with all of this going on he's protecting people he has friends of every nationality creed and he has no I did this in his phone's all he wants to do with people that work\nAnd do what they need to do but he is he's almost ten breaking point\nSo your sway I Want to hear I think I understand what you're saying you're saying you're agreeing with me that in this case is your husband is in the breaking point from the hatred towards white people\nYes yes and he doesn't understand it and it's like why do you want a blessed to be a white person is and again you can say he's biracial pays half Hispanic and half white but he doesn't understand that all he wanted people to do what they're supposed to do\nAnd when you can't tell me on the air with your husband says but I think you're implying he's reaching a point of exploding isn't that what you're saying\nYes he is and he's he's in his retirement years he teaches firearms training and people are becoming are getting to the point where they're feeling that there has to be defended just to go on just to go onto the street anymore he's feeling that he's becoming a target when handle\nI I understand that very well and here I understand I live like that for twenty five years is a talk show host was received death threats for the day I started on cancer vote you think it's easy now what you're saying now which is now gotten so generic is against all white males know\nAbsolutely and and thank goodness there's apply if there was a platform for people to a release their their anger and and again you get to the point what are you going to do about it I mean what what can we do I appreciate you telling us aren't going to boycott everybody and their brother were kind of oh\nNo no that doesn't work they wouldn't do anything unless it's targeted at a conservative these um these companies will not do a thing they only target conservatives\nI agree uh I I've seen this my entire career but um [noise] can you tell us some of the things your husband says without incriminating him\nYes absolutely um he he doesn't go anywhere without carrying a firearm with cheese he's able to do legally that our our house we live in a very rural area he um he he sees [noise]\nI have um health and it has kind of harm to the teeth and he [noise] he just doesn't understand he doesn't understand why why people are taking the view that white white men are prejudiced so white men are only out for themselves [noise] he um he just had an offer this and he he doesn't\nFeel ... water and he said to you in the privacy of your home that you can share with us that you feel is is a violent violence prone well\nAnd and like like with with my husband he basically everybody he knows he wants them to be perfect sentence firearms he just feels he's going to get into a war not only for foreign going to get into a liberal versus conservative war so\nHe fears a political civil war yes yes yeah but it's is breaking down on racial lines because of CNN\nYeah it absolutely is that again that in in the broad picture my my husband my husband that's that's the bad thing about it my husband has and myself we have friends all nationality\nSo it it's almost to that point are conservative friends that are black Hispanic Asian they feel the same way he does so he goes I'm officer\nThey feel powerless when they let him arriving maniac racist like this on CNN stoke the flames of hatred\nYes yes and there's there's no way to stop them how do we shut them up\nWell with for ... let me tell you this I Am the
