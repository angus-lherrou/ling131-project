you're talking about ... different universes and where we are today and different things the things I Know you're very spiritual guy\nA growing up in Minnesota my family have lived in a haunted house and the thought several votes I Want to ask your opinion what do you feel about goals in life and angels also because they're very spiritual [noise]\nIt's a good question since my dog is kind of very old right now and it's forcing me to face the inevitable you know we all think about it then we pushed out of mine were young we don't think about dying at all then we get older we try to push it out

guardian angels that's strange part a part of me is still very childlike I actually do believe that they're at the angels out there that that I don't know guide us protect us in some way and I think that if you tune into the bad part of your nature and the bad part of the universe\nYou don't get angels you get the devils then they guide you in the worst behavior\nAnd I think that that's true whether it's a psychological phenomenon or a spiritual phenomenon I I certainly don't know\nBut I have found in my own life without sounding making stuff up I think angels have saved my life at least three or four times one step in one direction at one step at another and I would have been a gun or you know what I'm saying so what's the next question since we're doing friday spiritual quests or what's the next one\nFor the next thing I wanted to say I think after seeing that goes it actually brought me closer to God because it made me see a different existence in real life you see something

are the leading artist do you think they talk\nTo me no they don't talk to me I grew up with literate artist I wrote I grow up what do you think I play rock and roll for from the fifties first of all I Love it but there's a reason for it have you heard the lyrics they glorify women\nWomen are beautiful\nIt's a different thing now the lyrics from these filth artists debates women turn women into garbage I was living in the meat to generation and I'm supposed to worship gutter rats who talk about beating up women how to use you gotta like tissue paper\nYou know you got it all wrong look at the lyrics that these these jumped catch wherever delivered for having me somewhere it's all about drugs sex glorifying it showing off with things that they own\nShowing off where you know wearing stuff

family by ... by a timeshare you name my hello I'm ... now CEO and founder of Wesley financial wrote ten years ago I started helping folks canceled our timeshare contracts process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom sure it's the only thing that you can ... you can't tell me how much it's going to college or when it's going to end what are you my timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they won't ... annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends\nEven when you die your families now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de ... now I guarantee if we can't cancer timeshare contract you'll pay nothing\nNever happened never happened before and when you hear idiots on CNN like Don lemonade saying you can't pull them a mom\nAnd there's nothing wrong with this kind of action we have now moved into a new world in America when the left like as you start with Eric Holder the former chief law enforcement officer in American saying when they go low we kick them I'd never heard anything like this\nYou don't even hear that from radicals I mean this is really bizarre and for him to say that and to incite that kind of violence against people\nAnd you know we have Steve Sebelius who took a bullet you had Rand Paul who was attacked from behind and a cowardly or attack on his back while leaders mowing his own lawn you have this the kind of things that my daughter and his experience Japan on the in Florida has experienced that Ted Cruz and his wife\nHad happened that a person Nielsen that the H a secretary and Mitch McConnell has passed I mean this is getting out of control this is no longer an isolated incident and this tearing down but people who are so lunatics that they try to scratch through a ... ton barn store if the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way\nThis is Petra once a\nWhile but Governor Huckabee it's coming from the top there actually telling them it's OK to become unhinged and violent you know Hillary Clinton saying\nWe don't need civility until we're in power again and we take the power away from them so it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down and I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know when mass hysteria gets out of control it doesn't limited to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of decorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong as folk and\nBut we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal or when they're at their homes when they're trying to enjoy a movie\nAnd and when you take their liberty from them that's not America Michael that's not what we're about we're about ... green disagreeing and the right way and the right place at the right time for\nUs but we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these ... are doing\nWell okay so the question becomes\nHow do we stop it I I spent the half hour show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people defended themselves in restaurants against these left wing mobs it's not an easy question\nBecause there are limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the other hand we can't run away just because they want us to run away and that's the topic for another day we're talking about this issue but for a few seconds talking about the mid term elections I personally believe governor ... can be that the violence of the quote new Democratic Party has ever told a poll them\nThings actually saying this is the new Democratic Party we kick them when they're down\nI actually think that this is going to alienate the vast\nMiddle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the counter effect set the radicals wanted to have that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think I totally\nAgree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center or who are unabashed liberal decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not learning turns or they do have some sense of personal responsibility and they don't want to see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly it was started by young when I had on my show on brand instructor who is is interestingly a New York\nAre activists or he sees gay it probably is the last person a lot of people think would be on my show we hit it off right we had a terrific can counter\nUm here it's been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and he was leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the face of pages ... thousands of people who are\n... truly feel liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off that the fans and they no longer can assert themselves or something there's like to them and that has a encourage people to be violent\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty but\nGovernor Governor Huckabee you are from media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching say that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turn the other cheek forever does it [noise]\nWell turn the other cheek does not mean that you're a ... I think people you know said bought sort of meet me does not mean week\nThe word ... comes from a word and it means strength brought under such checks and it's the same or different the used to speak of domestic creating a horse\nWhich doesn't mean you make the horse meat it means you challenges strengthen his energy and Jesus said bless them equally saying has blessed are those who keep their strength to have power but his channel it in a way that it's constructive so this idea that Christians are just push rovers and we sit back and take it as a chance\nOn you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right\nI think it's more of an appropriate for people who are believers not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge for to try to see justice and justice is not being served when people are white about when there are ... those are things that far\nFor ... for their fears falsely things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings and it is the\nAbsolute imperative for truth people face the fight against those injustices so anybody who thinks that surface even chemical world is going to sit back and just\nAct like it's okay to the Savage rabbits and destroy ...\nWell the next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing moms\nThey will go into churches and upset sermons and knock over alters we can't prevent this and I think that we we people a belief we people of traditional values have to understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now\nI Want to stick to the positive and\nWe'll go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the street violence of the communist movements I Believe politically is going to have a uh uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with the correct\n[noise] absolutely I I Do feel that this a blue wave or is it may be grossly over estimated I think we're going to save a huge turnout from Republicans or conservatives who are beginning to wipe out\nThat this is no time to sleep that after we saw what happened to have it on here is the attempt five\nJust destroyed the processes and Michael my comes down to it let's be real clear\nWhat's at stake here is whether or not we have a system of government in which we decide things five ... not five tantrums\nAnd the reason we're having all these issues is because the Democrats have refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen elections and would have been that way with it if we reward that for their bad behavior you get more of it\nIs the same thing when you raise your child or trainers off and say you reward you get more because they have are you conscious French you get less ... have your other Petra likes this free yelling the violence the attacks physically and otherwise the lines at a struck fitness free\nAccount reward if we've got to go out when a lectures and what you were talking about earlier there has to be the legal consequences for the people who engage in this\nAbsolutely a hundred percent or so\nAnd and again Governor Huckabee I I I'm admirer the work you're doing on television I look forward to being with you later on in the day and it'll be on this weekend given the audience please the times of the television shows again if in case they missed the\n... on a Saturday or Sunday like that for shots at it and that can also go to the TV and see any
