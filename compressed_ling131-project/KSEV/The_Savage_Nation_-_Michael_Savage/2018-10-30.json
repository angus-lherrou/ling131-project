President Trump's policy and the Obama administration liking the American people and promoted in Iran deal that gave them all of the clear pathway to a nuclear weapon\nPresident from not only move the

responded because it's while it's just tremendously dishonest so let's start with immediate story that came currently I'm Sorry that\nThe all the deeply upsetting feet wet setting because we should all be on the same side when it comes to anti Semitism I think we probably all would be on the inside when it comes to anti Semitism but nobody's actually willing to call it anti Semitism and when and

generally have respect for the New York Times She's pointed out today letter to President Trump from Pittsburgh Jewish leaders\nAnd it's a headline that was painted by a variety of media group the Washington Post he is not welcome here that will support Pittsburgh Jewish leaders calling on Trump to denounce white national anthem\nThe hill progressive Jewish leaders tell Trump he not welcome in Pittsburgh and so he denounces white nationalism Newsweek Jewish groups that Donald Trump not welcome in Pittsburgh and how he's ready to fully denounce white nationalism\nComing up the media have suggested\nOver and over and over now headlined the Jewish leaders are condemning President Trump or even trying to come to visit for Saturday and why is an absolute lie I Will tell you that there's all I have the evidence and Arab media around with it anyway because that's the biggest engineer [noise]\nIn but Julia ... is going to offer rocker and here's what she waited too overwhelming gentile

here where you live I Hope the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth it so she is now it's using Jews in the United states voted for President Trump or support President Trump now I'm doing loyalty they care about Jews in Israel and non Jews in America because the president is getting killed in America well he's being pro Israel\nExcept for the fact that the shooter specifically hated President Trump and it's up for the fact that you don't get to blame Jews for how they vote on Jews getting killed about blaming victims ... anybody is at the Pentagon voted\nMaybe they voted for Trump maybe they didn't it doesn't matter you don't get to blame people for the death of other people when they have no connection to the death of other people\nBut this is what the lessons decided to do they decided that every bad thing that happens in the country from an evil person has to be the result of President Trump's rhetoric now again I condemned President Trump when it came to the right stuff but you can't show me the connection that it's solid between what happened at the Pittsburgh tend to go out and\nPresident Trump's outright step number one and number two we're going to talk about rhetoric that leads to violence against you that is going to open a whole can of worms I don't think the last one to open\nIn ... she was just\nAn idiot and many of these Ralph he's

I'm an Orthodox Jew and today lie in a day why I go to synagogue way more than any of the people who I quoted so far on the show\nAnd not only that I'm seeing an argument being made well get to this and the second gun control argument that as being made by folks on the left in response to all of them you know my response to all of this\nI'm going to start carrying a gun to school and that's my response you all day my responses Jews should be armed people in synagogue should be armed and you know why because white nationalist are not going to give up their gun evil people don't give up their done that means I Want more people at my actual\nArm I Will or security guards at my shoulder into all of that in just a second but first let's talk about life insurance life insurance is certainly not most enjoyable thing to talk about\nMost people don't like to think about what happened after that permit something happens to you\nBut actually having life insurance is a really good feeling it's nice to know that if anything were to happen your family won't have to try to go find me policy genius the easy way to get life insurance on line and just doing it in compare quote from the top insurers to find the best policy for you and when you compare court you save money to indeed that simple policy juniors and help them or four million people shop for insurance and placed over twenty billion dollars\nIn coverage they don't just do life insurance they all have your disability insurance and auto insurance home and her\nAnd you care about it and covered so if you've been avoiding getting life insurance because difficulties are confusing if policies union deprives good apology genius dot com get your quote applying minutes into the whole thing on your own right now pathology geniuses indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance there's no reason for you to put it off actually responsible for you\nNot to have life insurance policy genius makes everything really easy because again into managing their quotes from the top and shirts and find the best policy for you don't have money policy genius dot comic the easy way to compare and violates insurance\nThat as I say members in the Democratic lap and decided that went in and has met at shooting takes place in Pittsburgh that has nothing to do with President Trump the obviously President Trump's fault and they've continued with the narrative Franklin for the day comments over the last year and a full column basically on this idea that members of the Jewish community and support Republicans are responsible\nIf we did the organized shutting up Sheldon Adelson Jared Kushner and other Jewish enabler as a matter of protecting the security of the community\nIt's only going straight immediately turned cushion are now going to prevent shooting that's in a dog mhm\nMean to Sheldon Adelson one of the great supporters of Israel in the United states and one of the great support of Jewish programs like birth rate in the United states that somehow going to make you safer in the United states\nSo if you're ... or ... Keith Ellison or get a bunch of Democrats who openly hobnobbing with when that's our store and that makes us safer but if you Shaun the most pro Israel president in American history\nAnd any who supports that President even walk in his rhetoric than you are somehow making the Jewish community paper\nAnd then you get from like Adam Schiff and Democrat from California he says President Trump set the tone of hatred that it'd be easy argument on again this is just an extension of the argument made last week about the bombing attempt against democratic members that rhetoric is\nIs what causes violence\nI don't remember any of the conversations happening on mainstream television after Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a bunch of Congress people on the congressional baseball field I don't remember the conversation happening for longer than to date was out of the headlines immediately now we're going to get nothing but that for months because this was always let let's be clear about something this was always going to be the Democratic narrative\n... almost has nothing to the president from that President Trump plays right into the heart of it and you can't try to stay but\nIt has almost nothing to do with President Trump is this happened under President Bush you get the same crap and it's happened in our President Romney you get the same crap and would not matter people on the left high to suggest that I was responsible for the bombing attempt last week they're both on the left and tried to adjust that eyeball responsibility for what happened in Pittsburgh\nAnd you can you can separate out all the issues you can condemn bad rhetoric when he did on it\nAnd in Pittsburgh and you can you can separate out all the issues you can condemn that rhetoric when he did on any side without doing this routine as part of an attack job where Adam Schiff and suddenly the great arbiter of decent rhetoric in the middle of a terrible political time\nNo one such the tone more than president United States and the tone that he just went up division off in one of hatred or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists are and there's no escaping or collective responsibility with its own scraping the tone of each that's for the country\nOkay it's just ... again I agree that President from France had a better at home for the country to blame president from telling for everything that had happened to pour in pain and tone of the country was already off the rails by twenty twelve years since we've had a decent political conversation in the country being very very long time\nBut let's not pretend that the world started spinning when President Trump suddenly entered the political spent ... again and let's stop pretending and the Democratic party has clean hands when it comes to associate with anti Semite\nNow one of the one of the more Scarlett attack on on Trump and comes on the right in the congestion and if you are critical of George Soros or somehow ... medic\nSo there's been a big narrative put out by comes on the left had George Soros who has a lean democratic donor that if you criticized George Soros by suggesting that he gets a lot of money to cause is there enough area and it means they are somehow and he's ...\nNow you can attach or shark in Annapolis medically you got that part of the Jewish come all attempting to run the country but it seems to me that the criticism of George Soros on the right on the mainstream right has been\nNo more market and the criticism Sheldon Adelson on the left\nIt seems to me that the criticism on George and very much akin to the criticism help rather on the left and yet the idea now that we're going to spend ... into the ... all about George ... Jewish heritage which\nIs nonsense and but again and end up pushing it and say you're blaming them or you believe in them\nAnd blaming them for putting that on the air and knocked can be correcting him in real time and I'd go for like twelve hours later drink about unemployment honestly at this level after we'd have soccer costs are lower and grim and I've known all these people in the past right on TV every night I'm blaming the management of Fox and the investors and father when he talking about here and there was a fire in the\n... the dead the caravan had something to do with the thorough ... run hate departments or something like that\nAnd now that anti thematic no in any idiotic and Italian genetic endorse almost doesn't run the state department but the idea that going after George Thoreau as an affair and force in American politics and somehow inherently aunt medic is ridiculous and the same way I think things are going after Sheldon Adelson is inherently anti Semitic when he's a major donor to the Republican Party\nBut I don't have time looking for an hour and they found a convenient narrative again I'm not going to pretend I'm not going to pretend that you left\nHave clean hands when it comes to fighting anti Semitism and they certainly not the women's march pointed out their sympathy for all of that and it's when it's being something that we are turning our great to action with\nWith Jewish Action can equip them out there and you can't magazine a fallback attack can never happen again and they're not in the tuning around ...

and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you can't have a policeman in ah in every home\nAnd so we come back to the questions of the day what you should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools

know that after the killing to stop it but they can't stop it because of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there the rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mentally invent individuals funded by Soros his son in this group ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a tower from the arc and felt the power of those letters and the power of the books of Moses in those letters there's a magic in it by the way of power that you can imagine unless you actually have done it\nWhen you're standing in front of those he wrote letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of a

you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nBecause there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes they did a lot of white nationalist with America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalism in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America see an awful lot of white nationalist who went to divulge fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word and why the national spin linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula ... a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to not see them\nAnd this was a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people don't even know what they're talking about the things that if you are of a Caucasian background and you were a nationalist your anoxic\nIt ain't necessarily so [noise] so therefore we have to look into the minds of the white nationalist especially the one who did this horrible thing this killing on Saturday and I haven't gotten to it yet I

escalated with the use of a pen and a phone by the Iraq was saying Obama who would not letting the Europeans in biologic didn't want any people from Europe he wanted as many people from Africa and the middle east as he could get into this country\nIt's a sad fact of reality but if you look at it from the point of view of a rather how liberals are looking at Trump right now if you look at what Obama did could you say you didn't do it for any reasons other than the obvious\nSo Trump wants to end birthright citizenship\nAnd um of course it's going to go to the Supreme Court but the good news is our Supreme Court now and I'm taking a phrase that was used by liberal comedian when Obama was president\nAnd he looked up at the sky at the White House with all the other rush leopards from Hollywood\nAs there was a fly over by the U.S air force and one of the comedians looked up and said it's our air force now because these are anti military left these from Hollywood will always hated the military so

well about the same level as those who still go to Hollywood movies\nNow there's another element to this Ike a baby a situation which is birth tourism oh that's a big one and you know which

the fourteenth amendment which is a good story to talk about as a very real story we know what the scholars are saying\nWhich is that um it will go to the to the courts and we know that the left wing costs will say no he's wrong and then it'll go to Supreme and they will probably side with Trump even at this court even this court right now would likely side with Trump\nYou know now for by the time

has plummeted since Obama opened up the floodgates to a third world those who are illiterate in their own language\nThis is something I cannot emphasize enough we're not even bringing in people who are literate in their own language their illiterate in their home country that cannot read or write most of them cannot read or write in their own language do you know that\nAre you aware that we are calling from the bottom of all of societies on earth\nWe're not taking even moderately educated people from these countries to come here which some literacy we are getting people that don't have no

give me your tired your poor your hungry and those can be for it so repeated again that noble phrase written by Emma Goldman I Believe at on the stature Emma Lazarus always confused as to why which Lazarus\nWas Goldman biggest Goldman was thrown out of the country Goldman was deported for being a real no good luck\nThat's where people could still be deported Emma golden was thrown out of America for opposing the world war I think World War one\nThis was out Emma Lazarus Lazarus okay Lazarus Lazarus labs are ... ... give us your tired your poor your hungry those you're referring now let's pause there for a moment before we all get so agitated that we lose our lunch\nI'll get I got to tell you this so important to know back\nThree four years ago I was on a yacht more in the west side of New York on the Hudson River and the Chelsea district\nAnd I gave a little party for people from my radio business and people from my publishing world about a hundred people came aboard for a cocktail party and I gave a little speech which I played on the show twice over the years 'cause I'm so proud of it and I think it's called an immigrant son\nArrives in New York against something like that and I stood on that yet and I looked\nAt the statue of liberty right down the Hudson River where ... years later would save those people on a plane you know the Hudson River name for Henry option that I have a white male who were they named the river for maybe they can rename the Hudson River\nMaybe she'll river or something like that because it may offend people now the Hudson River and there's a statue of liberty and I pointed to it and I gave some remarks to the audience I Hope that they understood what I was saying that only in America\nCould the son of an immigrant meaning me\nMe here on this boat one of my grandfather came here on the urge\nSteer edge steer urge third class fourth class they came in no better than most animals and they were sick for most of the voyage and they got off the boat with very little in their pockets but\nThey had to scale or a trade that people to take care of them we usually take care of by relatives who were waiting for them in the city of their arrival there was no welfare waiting for them and they wouldn't have gotten in the country if they have no means of support you didn't get in here\nSo the rest of the story you open the little tailor shop you'd probably work for someone for a while and then he was so good in some skilled at what he was doing as I was told years later I never met him he died at thirty nine or forty I don't know how old he died young you know\nSelling himself here in this country very said I Wish I'd known him but he's the astronaut or the family Sam I call him the asteroid or the family or one of my books\nSo this guy\nOpens a tailor shop and it becomes so not well known in New York\nAmongst the wise guys I heard I don't know I heard the story they all had their suits made by a you know how they always like a nice suits down there and he saw in those days the gangsters anyway he may suits for them or you didn't give them away charge them and he made that suits and then he died of a heart attack God Bless them\nSo what I'm saying to you is I have sympathy for those wanting to come here and make a better life for themselves I Know what it's like to want something and worked for it\nBut I also know what it's like to want something worked for it and then be destroyed in this country by social engineers member that phrase popular about five years ago I remember the social engineering that we used to talk about five years ago on the radio while we have the social engineer still at work\nAnd if you ever have ever been attacked by the left wing social engineers because you're a white male you'll know what I'm Talking about\nAnd that means you had your birthright stolen from you buy the ACLU as I originally did but they didn't know what they were dealing with with me\nOh if they only knew who I really wasn't what I had inside of me they never would have stood in my way because all I Would have been with some nice professor at one of the university's law retired no one would have heard of me\nBut look what they created\nAnd look what happened as a result of the fact\nThat you can't keep a good man down\n... joy love Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred and seven eight bucks

around our polling places may not to be conducted as the left one so they're slowing down\nAnd apparently they are being turned back some of going back on their own\nThat's the good news and uh\nLet's see what else was going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh shortly and the left wing anti American creeps\nHad the nerve to make believe that those Jews the left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander ... and all that speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only started up anti Semitism because when you start to make believe\nThat your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the environment in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you star of anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros\nJust cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying you're not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president that against most Americans\nBy the way just give it a break for a day can you do that\nHuddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours although we're not caught a notion while you would like not to be that kind of the nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learned it can't just be done with love\nThey learn to have to tolerate in one hand and it was the in the other that's why they develop the ... some machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand the show and the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that story would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in it and and the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in American comes to understand that someone else it's not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddle in a closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I've been trying that won't people about this was Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you just throwing the dice thing like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and voted them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but I guess it was in India you know it came and went this one hit home because there was a white man who did it\nA craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews they didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter and the gay nightclub they didn't focus on\nThe other Florida is they just always look the other way because it doesn't fit the left wing agenda I mean it's not clear if you look at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open our eyes open heart with all these new stories and you take it and you do it for a living is very difficult I had a tough time over the weekend after this happened they hit me very close and very hard\nAnd I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children in them and caravan of which we know there are several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you or a gangster how would you come into the country you hide\nWhat would you walk in and say I'm a gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get on the line with the thousands of them with the women and children you have to push the carriages in front of you and you get the sympathy at the American people is all they're all just wanting to come in there all poor that's how you would do it\nSo it's slowing down on its own momentum is slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not notice\nForget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not this is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires\nPercentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not a lot of mattress name anymore suddenly a victim all of a sudden if the victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe fun was let's see on the far east funded black lives matter he's fun to occupy groups to me that's not American by the way that's quite something else\nAnd he was thrown out of Hungary\nHe's not welcome in many European countries old George Soros because they try to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian novel loves their own country as a Nazi according to George Soros they throw him out of out of Hungary so what he tried to do to that country\nThey closed the universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether over the airwaves\nIt's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist\nJust say why did nationalist together and immediately you have a bogeyman you could hate right if you live in a liberal community has since I was white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it what is the white nationalist\nThere's not too broad a statement of white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty\nWhat you are not see no so look at every cross in every war memorials cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war\nShe a lot of them were white most of them were white in the cemetery as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was it is and the military was comprised largely of white people and what let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting we\nLoved America not all but many war and so they for why well they wouldn't nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\n... simple so what they're white nationalist to show you know to find your terms a little clearer\nOne of the white nationalist was it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet\nTo the left wing in America they've conflated the terms and to have you so you could believe that anyone who is proud of the flag proud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person\nThink very carefully before you smear whites with that label or else
