that again\nDo not understand why Jeff Zucker thank the president of the United states is responsible for a bombing in a had a quarter just because the president said that he doesn't like the ... by the patch and the enemy of the people\nDon't like that language either I think that language is bad but then it's not language tangled sending bombs in the people at CNN that's not a thing the president and the United states in response to the media basically turning up outrage at him and at the right\nIt's I think not entirely inappropriate so first of all I had a\nPresident Trump is used rhetoric I don't like at all in his rhetoric that I think\nIs the moral with regard to the press I think he has used rhetoric was on his political opposition at an immoral does that mean again his inciting violence now and the press and he's very similar rhetoric about President Trump does that mean they are inciting violence no it doesn't heated rhetoric and violent rhetoric are not the same thing\nAnd to link the two means that eventually somebody just going to say what kinds of all the rhetoric because otherwise it's going to lead to violence there was President Trump going up in the media basically the media and President Trump can't stop covering each other and I think there's some truth on both sides in there's a lot of alternate factors of presidents had stopped with immediate scares\nThe media also has a responsibility to shed civil and stop the endless hostility and try to negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nAnd you know I agree with the president that the media doing horrible job of covering the news and in response to President Trump and they promote even more of a sudden and ... and more divisive politics is what they do\nBut is there any question that President Trump controlling them of course not because President Trump used similar rhetoric about media\nBasically which is to folks slapping each other and only in dynamite style in the face and then blame each other one guy down the street decide you're going to bomb the local school not the same thing it's there how can we can or I think much more correctly she Pepsi and then his choosing the Biden attack\nShe treated out President Trump asked Americans to come together and ten one very clear strong mistake will not take the act or threat of political violence bending hunting no place in the usa you chose to invite an attack America she night against all political violence\nAnd that is correct that is correct and I don't understand why President Trump and getting back for saying the right thing at that at that rally or at the at the White House and then he is getting back on the other side when he when he goes after the media anyway and then he ... he had and demonstrating full scale\nThat they are going to go with the narrative that they never went with the parents to buy ... they never went with a narrative with regard to the the attempted attack on who's in college but they are going to go full scale with the cat on President Trump the here Ken and Laurie abortion or saying\nYou know Trump's targets in is it a coincidence President Trump attacked a bunch of people and then those people get ... by mail mom you know we do in politics we attacked people on the other side and the and the idea\nThat people on the other side all the time and I mean I'm calling for a bombing of their house of course not and you know what's happening yeah mine are not calling for a bombing of my house and it's not a thing but here's Laurie border blaming from\nYou know ... these are names as you point out that come up all the time in his rallies I mean he's not particularly kind too but what are called mama either so ah I I I think it would've been who tend to be a little bit more complete and when they say about this\nSo now we are going to conflate we're going to conflate President Trump written ... President Trump calling for violence against prop up on it that's the case again uncalled for violence against Donald Trump every single day coming up to CNN believe President Trump\nIs responsible for the heated rhetoric that means violence ... fan and obviously doesn't have clean hands here either it seems like a lot of political prophecy on both sides when the real more to me if I'm not fighting violence and that was from violence talked about a venture\nNancy Pelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon they're jointly condemned statement from the president should earlier in the day expressing his concern over a series of suspected explosive devices sent the prominent Democrat in the day we looked at it with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people\nAnd that is our first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed as his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter he only neo Nazis and killed a young woman in Charlottesville and supporters rallies get violent with protesters dictators around the world and murders or did it then you know for instance a free press and the enemy\nOf the people now\nI think President Trump says a lot of that stuff how 'bout that unclear about this\nBut you're actually going to blame him for the bombing faith in the news this is what you're going to do now\nI can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just a year and a half ago\nWho was asked about ... nearly being shot that he almost died okay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that he left his Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame arts or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could have been connected with the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting as he done gallon members of Congress\nAbout health care and food into it he was he was standing there screaming about health care while I'm kind of murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then she's not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winters\nHave there and they say such a thing how dare they chose this sick individual does something to them all and it was horrible lady did hateful but for them to\nAll the sudden the sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's reverse I mean I Wonder what changed oh what changed as he was going to get one that will change so there's no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of Hackett and blunt on one end directed toward you in on the other end directed toward your opponent\nWe don't recognize that what we're actually holding in the store and if you use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you every store and has two legit\nBut according to the left it's just a habit and you can bury it in the twin shoulder blades of your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing so former first lady senator presidential candidate sheet that wasn't as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSaying well into her son's grades as an American I'm worried I worry about the direction of our country\nI worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them when their seats teenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton saying that's our top aide fleet brains who is really one of ... people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response mayor addicted to his um material\nOkay so next time somebody who they dig Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office on Fox News studio and then I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil what the other side\nIt is it legitimate like what's the day today today is the twenty fifth okay Joe legitimately twenty four ... fourteen days ago ... days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house hand or the Senate that twin ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect its strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullest of the crap\nAnd just one second but first let's talk about what you do you get ready every evening I loved the dollar shave has everything I Need to look steel and smell mind that but I won't even more in fact I never have to go to a store here in the next door you have to wait in line you have to find the product you have to deal with human\nYes he doesn't make you do any of those things they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me

then again ... everyone in full of crap including Andrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came down and said look and\nHave to turn down the temperature in the country and it has to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black and for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York Senate everyone who disagrees with my politics should get out of state and it's not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues\nLet me explain if you are sitting around today and they're going into\nIn same sex marriage and his views on social issues my name's point if you are sitting around today and uh going it's always better on the other side of this problem\nBy freaking near ... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here everybody does\nAnd that also means that blaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence in meetings with world country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric gr actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up your suggestion the other side of so evil at the very ... of their idea is likely to lean suggest captain destruction\nThat isn't that an an American perspective to an American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he won no matter how wrong head and I'm working actively tango should people on the congressional baseball feel that it's not his fault and Donald Trump can say whatever you want and you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump says\nHe has the right to say that's a long and she's not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb some place right now it might sound weary of all of that just because I Am weary of all that really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation where they have to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing\nAnd I felt really really ... let's stop making the country worst place and other new\nNBC News is actively hyping Megan Kelly black tape thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics or making Kelly we talked to yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show and she doesn't really understand why the woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for drought Tampa Diana Ross her party because when she was a kid people used the dark and they're asking for Halloween costumes and wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks that well black I had a long ... glory history in the United states had been set than except you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like in the end of the story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious or right just they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believed that nobody actually believed that Megan Kelly things black people are inferior genetically that black people are worse black people are morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believes that at NBC and it just shows you that capitalism one used by bad people\nYou know it's not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that he's not properly fitted for Megan Kelly name Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question her she's a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best they try to fit her into the Katie Couric fluff morning news routine\nAnd that didn't work for them and so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push out the door\nHow are they doing that by ... by actively stoking racial resentment in the United states and its ugly stuff\nAnd we can use it now saying they're going to air taped episodes of making a show this week and if they're going to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nThan anyone really believe that the MDC brat is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK foul racism they would actually think that no of course not going to just ... trying to do great shortstop meant for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd they the head of NBC News and the lack the overly ... into Kelly after she apologized to ship apologizing and lack that well there is no way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then Lester Holt cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nAnd some NBC decided you eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient that it\nAnd no one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes ... unless they're preparing you're trapped somebody up and throw them in the wood chipper and that's basically what NBC is doing here I Wonder why nobody trust me I mean there's this it really is a great need it sort of just how corrupt the media are\nThere's no question that NBC is just attempting to flame the soap the flames here in orange than they can make a move by making Kelly that they wouldn't otherwise be able to make contractually so well done over at NBC making the country worst place they can save some money on a host that you yourself box in the wrong way coming up\nThe president of the United states is
