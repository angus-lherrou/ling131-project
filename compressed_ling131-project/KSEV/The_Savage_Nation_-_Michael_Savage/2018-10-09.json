going to be I asked\nThem back into the bench bureau show\nTactic number one for the Democrats in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh data entry to the Supreme Court is well let's just try to change the system itself well you'd actually controlled government you do any of those things and also that just to kind of work but that that was under attack and number two which is that women are suddenly under attack everywhere from everywhere\nOne of the great life is being perpetrated is being perpetrated by something Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett you'll remember the top advisor to President Obama and between that that I think it sums up well the argument being made by told channel that's close to all of the survivors of sexual assault and women who wonder if they will be believed that they are attacked no there's a growing powerful moving to support there will always have your back\nWe believe you we will stand with you we will defend you change is coming\nTo the idea here is that if you supported Brett Kavanaugh your annoying women who make allegations\nOf sexual assault it it's so transparent and it's really quite vicious and disgusting\nI again\nOppose Roy Moore for the Senate in Alabama as a Republican because there is there a viable evidence that he had done bad things with young girls when he was a younger man I did not vote for President Trump in large measure because of his treatment of women there are lots of people are not happy\nWith sexual assault allegation Susan Collins the senator from Maine who came out in favor of right now she's basically the deciding vote she's been ripped apart from what she had to pay on CNN but there's nothing inherently wrong with what she said on CNN\nHere's her explaining that what you believe something happened to Christine Blasey Ford she just doesn't believe that according to the proponents of the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh was it was a guy who did it\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her a satellite so I Do believe that she was from the south and I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the U.S at ...\nOkay and that prompted maybe her on her to come out and say how could Susan Collins down how could you encounter that was really funny because I remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forward by ... and she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh had gang rape her\nOr that he was involved in gang rape you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women don't they believe that all women ought to be believed or the average of whether there's any sort of their viable are corroborating evidence\nBut Julie ... she was gone\nBut not that not only among women had to leave the women who he wants to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree that Portland slightly more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she totally credible either early ... story isn't corroborated and then people are like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving out when it\nRight but you don't believe about women you know really wanting to Broderick he'll believe Kathleen will you don't believe Paula Jones ... sandwich by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back and then I ...\nIt's just it's maddening but you're making your own and say how could Susan Collins even have a ... how could you even ... because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ... of history simply without any Robert of evidence whatsoever\nWhat to say that she thinks that back and forth I think that she wants to soften why does that and see that there was cooperation with the he has talked about her for her husband to others before back half an hour every nominated to the Supreme Court case took a lie detector tests cooperation with their\nLittle cups Mazie Hirono jet again this is built on the line is that we may have lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war is going to be that men verses women and women always must be believed and that men who do not buy in or women don't buy in our job ... of the system\nAnd then there's the argument that may come on I was on meet the press so it was ... shut up and make a path to after showing up at the hearing because of Dianne Feinstein who is a very serious senator Leno and she explained were winning the cultural battle\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot has changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for that when I'm fighting for that generation\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power and that would that we've had to deal with\nAnd so this is this is what Democrats are hoping and they're hoping in most while possible way coming up a lot of folks\nIn the media tweeting about how the United States Senate is that they just discovered checks and balances after a couple of hundred years what will they discovered that the United states is actually on a continent called North America I don't know I mean there's so many things for them to discover about the new found the suffering a second this measure of\nI Will say is that a bad strategy to send your teenage girl ... high school and her Brian panties and just going to just going to say it's a bad idea\nAnd it doesn't make it bad parents say he'll means they are trying to protect your daughter from the fact that there are dangerous people in the world and also because maybe your daughter doesn't want to look like a sex object all the time\nAnd we just want to portray herself to sex object I like on the feminist movement move from the correct opinion about pornography that pornography which have justification of women for the pleasure of men to pornography is empowerment of women\nYeah I'm sure that all those men who are in their basements right now watching Stormy Daniels old page are thinking about the empowerment of women they're all feminists that's what they're thinking right now\nBut I Love this women who show up at the Capitol where women for Kavanaugh T shirts probably tell their daughters promotes revealing club does do that as though they alpha like equation put unless revealing clothes the same thing as we want to make you a non now okay\nWhen did not become such a terrible thing I didn't mention the modest too by the way I I just but let's not pretend that men don't women it's actualize objects especially when women wear wear clothing that makes them\nMore likely to be viewed as such it's a free country can wear what you want I'm not saying you shouldn't wear what you want I'm saying I wouldn't I Will tell my daughter that become now the idiots okay here's a there's peace continued then we're sympathetic to Senator Orrin hatch of Utah who actually shoot away a crowd of women and told them to grow up\nWell right because they were screaming at him like ... we play the tape on the show and then he told them to grow up and then they told him to grow up which was hilarious and she's one million years old or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who's response a woman telling him she was raped one I'm Sorry call the cops\nWhich is again not an improper response like I'm Sorry that happened to you maybe you should talk to the ... until we can catch the rapist and put him in jail is not a horrible response\nI liked it that's when did it become a bad response like I'm just wondering what do you think Lindsey Graham is going to do he'll grab his pistol like somebody Sam you're going to lead them to a house is going to burst through the front door Lindsey Graham is gonna burst through the friends are like well\nYou have to shoot this fellow now because this woman without any evidence and that she was raped by you like that that's going to happen and what do you think Lindsey Graham is going to say you'd want him and say you when it comes out and she was I was raped you think oh he was he supposed to say at that point you know what\nNow that he told me you are right right Kavanaugh's rape is what\nOkay this continues and we'll get deeper into the\nThe insane ... like mind of the of the left\nOn the on

loud enough that how men are Texas this will win out Alexis Cornell has a speech in the New York times we're going through it I think it's indicative of the mindset on the left that it's pretty insane so here's the she's already accused women who\nSupported Brett Kavanaugh or any Republican of being trader so these are the kinds of women who think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped\nThe kind of women who agree with President Trump that it's a very scary time for a government in America what she said during a news conference on Tuesday\nWell it turns out you don't actually have compared it to being falsely accused of rape is pretty bad he falsely accused of rape doesn't eat ruin your life to Troy reputation destroy your family\nI don't know if you compare that to rate because there's no comparison like why don't I don't see the necessity of of comparing the crimes but mostly it gives the right in the kind of a bad thing when President Trump says it's a very scary time for young men in America that is a hundred percent true\nI don't know a single mom not a single mom with a boy was not worried about the possibility of where all of this is going\nEspecially considering the vagaries of the nature of content in our current political discourse\nAre now living in a time when title nine charges can be brought against basically any man on any campus for any reason without any evidence and just for the life and the here's here's what is going to continue and the people would scare me the most are the mothers sisters in wives of young men because my stupid uterus still holds out something Cain hope of solidarity\nFirst of all I just would like to point out that appeared in the New York times\nThe most solid paper in the United states according to ... and it printed a sentence in which a woman said that her uterus hold out hope ... do not hold out hope ... are in Oregon\nA new thing my appendix holds out hope ... she says we're talking about white women seem sixty three percent who put their racial privilege ahead of their second class and gender status and twenty sixteen by voting ... whole the system\nBut look ahead of their second class and gender status and twenty sixteen by voting for the whole the system and valued only they're white and it just as they have for decades\nSo white women put their femininity behind them they're not real women is where the going white women aren't real women they're just white evil men just faceless nameless white people you know like each gender which which some whiteness since Nineteen fifty two white women have broken for democratic presidential candidates only twice\nIn the Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Ninety six election according to an analysis by Jane John a political scientist at the University of Southern California women of color and specifically black when they make the margin of difference for Democrats\nThe voting patterns of white women and white men mirror each other much more closely and they tend to cast their ballots Republicans the gender gap in politics is really a color line\nWell actually that's not really true the gender gap in politics is really a marriage line and you actually look at how single people versus how married people vote that's really the distinction\nMarry people tend to vote heavily Republican married women tend to vote heavily Republican single women tend to vote heavily Democrats are not about color and if I'm not ... it's very much about marital status\nWhy because when you have kids and you start thinking to the next generation when you start thinking what is the kind of society where I Want to bring up a family and when you start thinking you know I have a family unit that requires protection from an overarching\nFederal government that wants to get in my grill well that changes your mind a little bit\nBut according to the school now it's all about The Likeness that's because white women benefit from patriarchy my trading on their white men to monopolize resources for mutual game\nIn return their place on a pedestal many cherished interfered as Speaker Paul Ryan said about women but all the while deny basic rights the digital nonsensical it's just nonsense of I Know that first and Main white women benefit from patriarchy like\nTrading on their way to monopolize resources for mutual game\nFirst of all replace white with black and that tend to not be placed racist but beyond that the idea that women are somehow trading on their sexuality in order to achieve\nSome some decent treatment at the hands of the patriarchy niches offices all crazy I'm Sorry this is all crazy stuff and if I urge Democrats to run down the hill screaming it's like they actually just houses passed one please go do this make this year electoral strategy\nAlthough suburban white women who you're trying to gain in the next election I urge you to scream at them and tell them that they are terrible people because they're white\nGo for that let's do that\nIt's it's amazing it's amazing so or ... or evidence she says\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election did white women really vote with their white and it's in mine Laurie Frasier y'all clear political scientist at UCLA recently measure the effect of racial identity on white women's willingness to support Trump and twice the scene and hounded positive into typically significant relationship so white women who voted for him did show to prop up the rightness\nOr alternatively correlation does not equal causation because that's a basic mathematical and statistical science it's in the study white women who agreed that many women interpret innocent remarks or access access or Seventeen percent more likely to vote for Republican candidate\nRight that makes sense because Democrats have gotten hysterical on the issue and they have decided that everything can be treated as right when that game and suggested that seeming to get to the ... of sexual misconduct he's run out of town on a rail my thoughts on the left\nSo finally she concluded bloodbath between white men and white women as an issue in the November midterms President Trump knows it and if that's used a news conference he singles white women to hold the line that people that have been complaining to me about it the most about what's happening or women women are very angry yes\nWomen are very angry many mothers many mothers are very angry and that crosses racial lines\nBut this is the the the attempt militarized me too movement which was supposed to be a bipartisan movement with basically universal support no one wants to see women mistreated has now been shattered thanks to politics because the left decided that meat you any allegations that under me to any allegation brought against someone they like\nIt's going to be ignored and any allegation brought against someone they don't like is going to be upheld\nThat's the way the networks according to the left to meet you broke on the shoulder politics because we were all on the side with regard to all this stuff but no longer I Can't be on the side of the people who want

an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies got them onto the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of a state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus\nAll the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before unfortunately the rest is historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others than the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the numbers students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot was that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair and went home to mommy and took a job in McDonalds\nThey will no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard and I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep talking to police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people

stopped and the only way to stop them as my passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding

won't you lose the entire conservative base\nYou're not as stupid as they think you are you actually know what's going on America does not want to know the war in the middle East that I said so and I think I was heard and I think she failed her controllers whoever they may be an average suspicion who she really your reports to what it is and the president the United states so my opinion is\nHaley's resignation as first of all the good thing unless they pick someone even more militant that her she was a militant hawk in a terrible situation for America we didn't need a militant walk in the UN\nWe needed a skill diplomatically you're when she was not a skill diplomat and as I said she couldn't ignite a war with Russia my bombing Syria and so her controllers polar off the stage
