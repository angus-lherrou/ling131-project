vote on Brett Kavanaugh was closer than expected and that is because of the\nPolitically ... behavior or Lincoln Murkowski of Alaska Lisa Murkowski in Alaska voted no on culture Joe Manchin of West Virginia which is to retain his seat in the Senate moaning yeah\nThat that is now a bipartisan opposition because one vote by hard not to have nine also bipartisan support for Kavanaugh has one basically one ... one Democrat\nOne Republican voted no on culture but the thing is too close for comfort wouldn't have been nice right about now he Alabama GOP had not nominated Roy Moore to fill us

goal it's supposed to take place tomorrow and we used to work out the obviously is in the crosshairs because Lisa Murkowski who lost her primary in twenty two and then won a write in votes\nAnd what about forty four percent of the vote in her election before that in twenty and against the libertarian candidate should not wildly popular in Alaska or anything like that but she feels pretty secure because she's not up for reelection until twenty twenty two and now she gets to burnish her feminist known a fighting\nIt would not be particularly surprising if the Democrats at some point when that instead of saying twenty twenty it would not be particularly surprising to somebody like Lisa Murkowski switch to independent Allen Jim Jeffords ... with the Democrats in order to preserve her seat that would not be a giant ...

then because he was an alleged rapist then because there's an alleged gang rape that means you can write to the dude back in college and then because he got angry when you've alleged that he committed rape\nOr that that is their latest stick one of the people pushing that stories John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he said that at the time I thought cabinet had the qualifications for the Supreme Court trying to get elected I changed my views for reasons that have no relationship with the flexibility I feel his performance in the hearing ultimately changed my mind\nHe said that there's near it to the criticism that he has political bias but I think there's a lot more in the evening lap and Brett Kavanaugh cried recovery got emotional and having a part of it and I saw that today it doesn't matter even then it was a motion in that are that he was partisan because he thought that the Democrats were out to get him\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that had been when we threw that Democrats were out to get him remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it then it became he was a gang rape once said you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service\nAnd that somebody you never knew came forward with an allegation against you accusing him of gang rape and the people who are opposed you politically the same people who Sandra Day ... because we were attacked your work then came forward and said we think that you are also a gang rape might say wait a second this feels like a party in ... job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing only folks who say judicial temperament first of all these folks have never met a judge\nAnd there are lots of judges were angry there are lots of judges who have personality issues like this idea that all judges are sort of ... on the hill and justice company the palm tree it's just not true it's just not her but the question of you to hold temperament it's how do you approach cases when you're on the bench we have twelve years\nI'm ... fourteen years ago a of Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench twelve years twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench\nNo indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament they moderate to moderate conservative on the bench\nAnd then he went through a full Senate hearing you remember they remember there was a Senate hearing before this whole garbage new cycle but yeah there's a whole that Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you have the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and court hit a hunger and\nThey went through the entire hearing and he was ... that right you wouldn't do that with the lip on him he was to do to robotic\nAnd then he went to the twelve years on the bench lasted a full hearing poised question\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gang rape and he got a little mad and it was oh my God how can you look at that that's that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people will react differently to different stimuli and you give me a massage that different thing when you're walking in the back of the head with a two by four I react slightly differently\nAnd you massage me and you want to do and I can send your touch that I'm probably going to be class at unhappy if however you clocked me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be no miffed enough to turn around and try and walk it back in the face\nThat's what happened to have it up but apparently that's no good showing who have not really it he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal\nTrying to defend his behavior and apologizing for me to emotional I like that at the time he goes no apology to anyone on any of the non if I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people would accuse me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I once read into the congressional record I'm willing to [noise] they\nAre willing to do this correctly\n... all Democratic senators accusing me of sexual\nAssault on women I've never met go F yourself and let me explain why me by yourself I mean I wouldn't go perform anatomically impossible function upon yourself in the back room\nUse whatever practically mechanisms you need to in order to achieve exactly that sort of a poppy ... hey that's what I Would have said Brett Kavanaugh just went in there and he said you guys are part of an advocate that that's a really nice way of saying what he told actually are and what they actually did hear coming up Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know the guy who was a real hot head can't be trusted and you just have a part of it in ... he wrote an op ed for the wall Street Journal\nThe reason people care about the Supreme Court the reason that people think that the Supreme Court matters is because of things like Rosie weight when the court decided that it was going to make national policy on the basis of left wing viewpoint having nothing to do the constitution\nAnd the left believed that the court was going to be its final bastion and left him no matter what happened they can always count on the court to step in and defend leftist policy priorities\nAnd for a long time that was basically correct and now it turns out that when Republicans want to restore the judiciary to its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written\nAs it was men than the left as well hold on one second hold on a second that what people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog catcher is right none of us would have happened\nIf we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody really cared about that\nThey care about the Supreme Court and they think the Supreme Court and important the only team the only reason people think the Supreme Court is important is because of lack has turned into a political tool and his use it as a club to ... ... people who actually believe in the text of the constitution for the last\n... years in the audience and picked up the odd years since the Nineteen sixties since many Griswold versus\nConnecticut although you can certainly side takes like what's hurting silver and the court has outstripped its boundaries many times before that if you read Scott ...\nYeah I I wrote my entire Harvard law school thirty or paper on the idea of the judicial review shouldn't get curtailed because they found was never intended for the Supreme Court superior political branch and yet that's exactly what's happening\nIn any hate the passions were running high yesterday and today the Marco Rubio was talking about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the halls and present it on the Senate Hart building and she was drowned out immediately by protesters 'cause this is the way our politics going now\n\nWe have one of the girls are where you know are these are all different\nOkay and that's just the ... I mean that was a normal day for the center of had to be escorted in my belief I Will not something remember that time when people sending the right wing was really crazy and really radical remember that the party and twenty ten how dangerous threat when ... you know they never acquired police presence to escort members of Congress to and from things\nAnd actually require that and\nLet's be Frank about this I don't recall a Republican staffer trying to ... members of Congress and release our children's health records which is a thing that actually happened and intern representative Sheila Jackson Lee tried to reveal senators children's health information that's what he allegedly threatened\nAnd that would be Jackson Cosco twenty thousand\nWorse for Sheila Jackson Lee and protesters in South of course and Marco Rubio\nHas a protester rating Joe Manchin of West Virginia or didn't just try to do the same thing I did Senator Flake button hold somebody in an elevator and then yell at them about how they obviously have women because they believe in due process\nAnd that was kind of written up and down by the right the other day for a speech that he gave on the floor of the Senate and that's because people were taking one line kind of out of context when he said he would have preferred Amy Coney Barrett\nSo what I write my original ... Coney Barrett if you recall\nBut the bottom line is that then that has voting for cabinet what the point that he made is that false dichotomy that's being drawn\nBy the left particularly between this case in the me too movement in which they say that if you support right cabinet and therefore I hate me too if you support rights have not due process and presumption of innocence therefore he don't take limited there it's like you said that garbage and it's nonsense and he joins aptly right of course that's exactly right\nSo I'm sure you have less in plain that\nAnyway and just one second but first let's talk about money it's sleeping enough probably not meeting the region and not sleeping in cars your mattress isn't that great I Know you've got that expensive natural out there at the mall but\nIt probably isn't as good as an actress than you can get from he looked like why because he would sleep personalized as your mattress it'll do liquid takes two minutes to complete and use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect matter\nWhether you're side lever a hot cleaver whether you like a pleasure from that was he like no one got new or confusion just going to have a link dot com slash Shapiro take that two minutes liquids and actually address and then they send it to you\nAnd you're in rapid inflation in front of you you're talking on the bed frame you're going to go my wife and I had to get ...

off just leap we're not interested in you anymore but this is the protesters short story it\nNoting you know there there's a lot of hold up today because President Trump tweeted out that some of these protesters are being paid and undoubtedly true there are a lot of these protesters who are members of groups that actually will pay you to be out there for the day I'm sure many of them are

criminalized drugs what ramping laws against venereal disease were dropped\nJust as an America would dropping laws against using heroin out first they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened in a while I'm a republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weakens police authority rapid lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing criminals subtly proliferation\nThe weekend policing the criminals subtly proliferated what else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give me some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about the backlash to this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards are put on black masks beat\nPeople up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world had seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards\nNow don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown stretch I Am simply giving you a piece of history lessons from history remember when I said many times those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing what do you think I kill myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what is truly so I'll go on so just like on the ... today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the advocates of today ads on by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing they're sort of communist weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking that Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these worm and so the German said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany and they formed units called brown shirts\nAnd they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want either be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story because this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou didn't know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up and opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing did you and I said\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong costs the left for like you to think he said look the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever\nImagine and so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his delusions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is important to my show tonight\nMy point is there has been a right\nWing backlash in this country and we have a charismatic leader but its solutions are not yet that extreme\nLeft would say any of us allusions or string ... said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much\nBeyond what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what is your Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer during college\nWhat do you do he drank mounted shuts drank too much about a ... ... what do you what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy and went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an operation\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the less than a super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong\nYou're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that see this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen that you can't believe are happening and what happens so fast you say it's not happening and liberalism will be the ... the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that he's being predicted by some\nEconomists is ah is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're the heightened now of stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThere for just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticized deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatism dummy up they shut their mouths you run your anyone in the radio talking about the run away and for the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nWhat someone's gotta say stop printing the money that's just crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the ... just before all of this\nThat it takes a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how valueless the money I become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down to run it you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there which you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America\nThe reviews left up there some of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by enemies or Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever their victory teaches us anything there are cycles to account I mean there are cycle to a political views and I pray that as I write on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the ones Greg United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses such as China and India rise we will sink even

over the weekend and a Murkowski here's the where's the story I Want to pull us out 'cause I'm Wondering if this is the ... coming that okay so\nClarence Thomas is a ... an accuser of his Mariah Smith who's a lawyer in Alaska she met with Lisa Murkowski to try to talk her out of supporting cabinet all\nShe was the one who said that I guess like what he groped her or something at one point and I don't know if that had an effect on Murkowski or not but that's just I'm just telling you because that's what\nAre the two it came out so I'm just I'm a\nAdjust to me I I just eat there has been nothing proven what they're trying to do with poison the environment they're trying to make it look like there's so many different accounts that it must be true because of the quantity\nThat's what they're trying to do they're trying to make it look like well there's so many there's such a huge quantity it must be true\nNone none of them are it's none of them have and then like when Dianne Feinstein mentioned Deborah Ramirez her story I don't believe her\nThat was crazy and all the people that were in there\nI don't believe that that Brett Kavanaugh I Do not believe or the brand Kevin I did that and all the people that were in the room that she was naming they said that never\nEver happened what in the world everybody again once again to a theater that\n\nHey if front capital the liar then why what I mean\nIf you're not proving your accusation Julie sweat neck\nThat somebody else a grown woman going to high school party\nWhat for years it's just weird\n[noise]\nSo then nothing was proven nothing was proven um nothing was was no new information it just needs to go forward\nDianne Feinstein had said we thought man filled with anger and aggression who raised his voice yeah an accused him of being a pedophile and a gang rape is the hell do you think how do you how the hell do you think a man is gonna is gonna react\nTo that how do you think the guy is going to react to that\nShe said hit this behavior ... we'd be able to hostility and belligerent that it's on becoming a someone speaking to be elevated of the United States Supreme court do you know why they're hitting him that hard on that because it was effective\nHe ... he\nAnd because they realize they screwed up there trying to not only do they want to Rob him of his reputation but they want to Rob him of his ability to defend himself\nThis is where our culture is social justice warrior ism and third wave feminism thinks that not only do they have the right to falsely accused you if you're a man and ruin your life but that you don't have the right to get upset about it or defend yourself about it over it that's what they're promoting right here this is what they are promoting\nYou don't get to do that\nYou don't get to you don't get to sit here and falsely maligned somebody and then you sure as hell don't get to deny them their ability to feel indignation over it y'all got exactly what y'all deserves\nGood night\nHouse with a guy you guys were rapists and upon\nWas he supposed to react and and for all the discussion of of toys and everything else there\nIs no remarks about how members of the Senate Judiciary committee said that he was quote evil unquote a and that they\nAlready declared him guilty and already declared that they were going to be voting no forum\n... so what what about the what about the belligerence of of\nNot doing\nNot not sending us to the FBI or including it in the hearing when the allegation was first delivered\nSo yeah I'm just I'm\nI\n\nI don't know and Dianne Feinstein this woman had a spy on her employer for Twenty years I don't even want to hear it\nDon't even want to hear it\nI there is [noise]\nThere's a really good piece it's over a spectator at this medium angles to duty to question for journalist malpractice if it's never been out practice\n\nThey say a reasonable objective establish media would have spent far more time than it has in delving into Dr forge background and credibility and her veracity under oath especially if they think it's relevant to endlessly parts Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook joking them or about beach weekend collegiate throwing of ice from a barroom glass\n\nThey say the examination must be done granted there's an important line not to be cross between rational examination of relevant information and on the other hand blaming or bullying the putative victim but it has to be done\nAnd on the other hand blaming or bullying the fugitive victim\nBut it has to be done you cannot be automatically assume to be guilty it's not a legal principle that immoral won a false allegation even if it never reached a court of law can ruin reputations in lives yeah most of the media\nHas that that is that the only one who's veracity and character a legitimate grounds for investigation is the one accused of heinous acts and its tried very true to refute that idiot the by reference GQ Salem witches at Duke lacrosse change the University of Virginia fraternity\nThey go on and off they say the in the case of\nDr Ford several lines of investigative investigation journalist should have pursued without prejudice either way would include the following does she have political or financial motives\nShe claims she's fiercely independent but does that actually her record anytime a conservative mix and you complain about a liberal the immediate assumption a news in the headlines is that the complaint is politically motivated so why not at least asked a question here\nTo her ... her story about why she went to Myrtle counseling stand scrutiny apparently not she said that the marital tensions Denver her demanding a second front door because of her fears of another assault\nFinished second front door was actually built several years before the counseling and would you use as an interest by get to the very couples counselor involved who use for his own home as the counselors place of business\nHas she ever in her life shown any fear of flying prior before she claims such fears the reason why she needed to delay the hearing answer apparently not why did she changed her story of an assault in the mid Nineteen eighties when she was in her late teens to Nineteen eighty two when she was just Fifteen and does her tail of struggling due to trauma match up with that timeline\nWhy did she offers so many shifting details in short order and leave so many blanks in her story why is it that her memory is credited as unquestionable with regard to cab and I'll be in the perpetrator her manifold infusions of memory or accepted as being a relevant to the former question\nWhy haven't reporters and editors been more interested in studying dichotomy between Ford's lifting of her lifelong friend Leland Kaiser as president that the gathering and Kaiser's insistence that she never even knew Kavanaugh and remembers nothing remotely like what what was claimed\nHow could they accept without question Ford's contention additives unremarkable for Kaiser to forget such a gathering\nI what why did it take a British not American publication to explore ... data\nAnd finally for ... testified quite specifically that she didn't speak with anyone during that time frame other than my council yet entered the hearing with her lifelong friend Monica McLean at twenty four year old FBI agent uh twenty four year FBI agent\nFormer spokesperson for anti Trump prosecutor a pre ... Hara whose houses in a row above beach uh and and and\nDelaware for may have been visiting her she was making her reports to Senator Dianne Feinstein shouldn't thorough reporters be asking what role McLean played in all of this and whether or not Ford was staying at our house and if she helps her line up with lawyers and the polygraph export\nExpert I mean there are all these questions that should be asking their inexcusable and it's bad and it is unreal but yet you're accused by the left because they want to shut down any and all debate well if you ask about any of this year horrible well if you don't then you are\nHow about that\nAs we move on Cal Tech great manufacturer firearms you got to go check out everything that they have the ... they have a bunch of stuff I'm not gonna sit here and lost everything because they have to I'm not going to pick a favorite like picking a favor kids\nThey uh it's more than just a a firearms manufacturing a entity they\nThey do things right they're incredibly innovative they just reinvent things they do new things they take pride in their ah family oriented culture is very small business mentality they celebrated tax reform and that allowed them to work on the creation of three new firearms\nAnd it's just this is why the ... the company has grown since its founding\nAh in what in the early nineties and they're they're so successful because of their devotion to innovation safety uh\nAwesome nuts and practicality everybody they're encouraged to contribute whether it's the already be liable have done right the passage either tactical shotguns whether it's the awesome humor thirty which is one of my favorites with a P. three eighty which I think every single gun owning Americans should own\nA you have to check out what ... whether it's you know that the average extra design or the ... the downward shell objection cleaning at keeping your line of sight clear so many things that they that they do and they do incredibly well why they're one of my favorite manufacturers go and check them out today Cal Tech weapons", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "06"}
