culture and so what is broken down in two separate use of where the economy should go from here\nYour number one in globalization and redistribution free markets everywhere and people are left behind then we have a a basic income but a universal basic income or we have a social welfare net safety net and that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nLike those people we just give them money basically said well all of the nation right does everybody getting cancer and then everybody who is left behind a little that we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better and that they can live better as model number one\nAnd a lot of folks in sort of the Trump campaign that's not right and the very end camp say that's not right hey instead only really needed a new model of how to think and the model of how to think is that job how do we provide jobs for people to his job provide meaning\nThat if you don't have a job you have like meeting\nSo what do we just restricted the free market itself why don't we put barriers on the free market in\nTorrance credit orange he doesn't really ... ... where we recommend tons of restrictions on the free market he talks about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets freer actually relieve regulations make it easier and generate job but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market and he has congested\nRestrictions on global trade for the apple\nAnd there's a real push by someone from getting populist right to restore union power even though it has Americans voluntarily moving out of the union not companies breaking unions that had led to the dark and union in the United states\nSo that model number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a new job and that again is more of a left leaning version so it's kind of fascinating you have liberals who are for globalization and ... and redistribution conservatives or for globalization and redistribution and you have liberals who are for workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives who are for workers enough market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what frame markets to\nLook at what free market show and a President Trump were really a free market in mind your guy that's when he became right now he knew what I'll even disappointed with any of the county and saying you know you're all worried about technological development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of the well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nA joke the shepherd of the economy coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry we'll write when out of business there were literally people whose job it let's make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nBut guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for the car in other words certain jobs get destroyed that we can all live in federal lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and Asia\nAnd that's the history of humanity forget capitalize on the history of humankind and adapting and adjusting to the environment around you is that you know we can't adapt and it got to new technology seems to me completely wrong headed\nAll the talk about how all the jobs are simply going to appear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing jobs by restricting the free market it's a big mistake the reason that we let them talk read like any human being can ever lived in the history of time\nIs because of the free market I think this debate is not only premature I think it's wrongheaded there's under four percent unemployment in the United states right now it's up for protests on employment there seven million unfilled jobs\nBefore we destroy it said something to create the sort of prosperity might want to think twice coming up President Trump now in trouble again this time not really his fault the Saudi Government apparently\nFound an enemy and cut them up and well let's find him and this became public knowledge now president from having to deal with the fallout will talk about how he can be able to fall out why the media treatment of president coming kind of unfair here there's a bunch of Russia [noise]\nHe's not going to stay up nights worrying about the Saudi Government committing human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on end I mean in the same Saudi administration\nThat had been waiting friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and the vast majority of the of the ... I mean nine eleven hijackers were Saudi\nSo that by the Saudi regime not exactly a wonderful wonderful regime but doesn't mean the United states doesn't have interests with regard to catty Arabia\nAs an example of President Trump saying that sort of thing repeatedly he was asked about Helsinki or do you remember he had that meeting in Helsinki with Latin recruiting where he was very complimentary approved and it was not his point of our treasury into like a brand new show on Fox Business which is while we're walking she pressed President Trump on Helsinki I here's what Trump had a day with food and\nThey want me to go up and I have actually measure was among shows it was nice to have [noise] I don't even understand\nWhat happened to me when I walked off the stage everyone so that was great for on a plane all of a sudden the fake news channel from for just jumping up and let me tell you if I was too tough to say [laughter] I could have a very good relationship with Russia having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing not a bad thing\nOkay so there was never that brand new one when he said that about Russia he said the same sort of thing about Kim Jong ... I mean this is how Trump act with regard to bad dictator can basically determines whether he needs them or not\nAnd then he tends to treat them nicely if you need them because this is how Trump is personally with all the people he deals with if you need you he's very nice you if he doesn't need to you that he calls your horse thing\nThat's what President Trump does and so when people are confused and President Trump didn't calling mom and been so pun a horse they just because that's not how President Trump operate\nThat does not mean however they want the left's ads about Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia is true so Ben Rhodes was just the worst Ben Rhodes the former national security adviser to President Trump\nHe jumps off all he's just awful he was the guy Who Lied to the American people about the Iran deal he was the leader of the Iranian regime outreach effort on the part of the Obama administration the actual outreach effort to an evil dictatorship lead sponsor of ... on planet earth attacking President Trump suggesting Trump somehow responsible for Saudi Arabia acting like Saudi Arabia\nJournalist everywhere are less safe and then the ... river president says you're also the enemy has said so full of\nValues like freedom of speech and dissent\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nThat comes from on that I think it's getting much worse or and and so this vacuum a penny advocacy for democratic values I think is putting people at risk and there's nobody else who's going to fill that vacuum of his friends in the United states in the United states of America is not doing that\nOkay this is why Trump supporters are not going to run a ... year thing you said the media cover for ... outreach to actual terrorists for years upon years upon years so in Trump says listen I'm not going to go crazy over the county thing most Americans are basically going to\nSay okay well All right now that the proper action\nNot a proper action is probably the sanctions at the very least in a citizen on some sort of change and Saturday but we do have leverage over the outage to pretend we don't just watch by\nPresident Trump is much more of a foreign policy realist than some of his predecessors\nAnd as foreign policy real is I think that it is not\nFully outside the bounds of propriety for him to suggest that it's it's a little much to abandon the Saudis in the middle of an actual ongoing Middle Eastern crisis between Sunni and Shia okay in just a second I Want to talk about the great battle of our time which is not Saudi Arabia versus Iran or even Republican versus Democrat\nAnd its President Trump versus Stormy Daniels we'll get to that and just want to take it but first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breaches pretty hard not to worry about where my day to\nMaking it online purchase or simply accessing your email couldn't put your private information at risk you're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies are mobile Internet provider\nNot only can they record you're browsing history and sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information which is why I decided to take back my privacy using expressing VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background and my computer\nPhone and tablet turning on expressed became protection it only takes one click and trust BP and secure and an ...

terrified of it because it shows a post feminist world that's act\nAbsolutely indicative of where we are going especially after the capital here if you're talking about a mass killing the men that was

me to me homelessness has no meaning that the left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNovak fly that this would help for white fit for that for less than ... is\nThe you know in other words if you for taking your increasing wave set your kid to their relatives achievement in school with they grow up and you're making\nA good point but how fair is that\n[noise] I think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond exactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond\nAnd then when a kid who thinks these great from Appalachian because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called there are no such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're the hard science has no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the other is mishmash of brac\nIn plain English but let's say you take a kid who was number one an Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how is he going to do\nHealth hell hole improving somebody you're rather than trying to navigate social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nFeel like you're assuming you will if you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI seen the opposite I think the people who were given an unfair advantage just become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton Harvard or whatever and then when he goes for a job and then he goes into the corporate world and then what is your demand you hire me or else what else do you\nKnow no one can\nCan you ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you with a drop of a hat everybody knows is\nThe thing is people listening to me saying how dare even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\nFor\nWe disagree on this one I say no don't get any one special advantage either it's equal to everyone or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing\nAs a reverse racism those words don't have any meaning he's rich racism isn't racism so your exclude Asians are white because they're doing too well that's racism and you know I thank God the agents finally to this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight that song\nBut no one who's ... listen to the show they're too busy working\nAnd have a five four and a seven to eight to now before I take a break\nI Can't wait for the podcast come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we have the podcast meeting this when we have a team of sixteen people and so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work on the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are and I have enormous ratings but because we're going to be going into the cycle of of the election and liberals are running some of these stations they're taking the off year that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your old will hear the radio show for an hour and then the anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time and I suspect that it'll be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that it will become one of the most important part cash on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or on the radio business it's that simple they can try all they want to destroy any station in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set you free\nKB T clean line seven go ahead please\nYes Hi good afternoon
