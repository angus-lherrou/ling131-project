officer in American saying when they go low we kick them I'd never heard anything like this\nYou don't even hear that from radicals I mean this is really bizarre and for him to say that and to incite that kind of violence against people\nUm you know we have Steve Phillies took a bullet you had Rand Paul who was attacked from behind on a cowardly or attack on his back while he was mowing his own lawn you have the the kind of things that my daughter has experienced Pam Bondi in Florida has experience if Ted Cruz and his wife\nHad happened that a person Nielsen does the H R secretary and Mitch McConnell has asked me this is getting out of control this is no longer an isolated incident and is carrying out but people who are so lunatic that they try to scratch through at Thirteen ton barn store if the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way\nThis is Petra once a\nWhile but Governor Huckabee is coming from the top there actually telling them it's OK to become unhinged and violent you know Hillary Clinton saying we don't need civility until we are in power again and we take the power away from them so it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down\nAnd I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know when NASA stereo gets out of control it doesn't limited to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of decorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong as folk and\nBut we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal or when they're at their homes or when they're trying to enjoy a movie\nAnd and when you take her to liberty from them that's not America Michael that's not what we're about we're about ... green green and the right way and the right place at the right time for\nUs but we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these loans are doing\nWell okay so the question becomes\nHow do we stop it I I spent half will show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people who've defended themselves in restaurants against the left wing mobs it's not an easy question\nBecause there are limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the other hand we can't run away just because they want us to run away and that's the topic for another day we're talking about\nThis issue but less for a few seconds talking about the mid term elections I personally believe Governor Huckabee that the violence of the quote new Democratic Party has ever told I told them he's actually saying this is the new Democrat Barney we kick them when they're down\n... I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast middle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the health effects that the radicals wanted to have that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think\nI totally agree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center\nWho are unabashed liberal decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not learning terms or they do have some sense of personal responsibility and they don't want to see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly it was started by young and I had on my show on brand instructor who it is interesting New York or activists\nOr he sees gays probably is the last person a lot of people think would be on my show we hit it off grade we had a terrific and counter on that he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and he was leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the face of pages said in their thousands of people who are\n... truly feel liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and they no longer can associate themselves or something there's like to them and that his or encourage people to be violent\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty for\nGovernor Governor Huckabee you are a media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching say that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turning on the cheek forever does it\nWill turn on the other cheek does not mean that you're a ... I think people you know say one set of me sneak does not mean week\nThe word ... comes from a word and it means strength front under subjects and it's the same or different the used to sneak domesticating force\nWhich doesn't mean you make the horse meat it means you challenges strengthen his energy and Jesus said bless them equally saying his blanket of those who keep their strength to have power but his channel it in a way that it's constructive so this idea that Christians are just push rovers and then we sit back and take it in the chance\nOn you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right I think it's more of an appropriate for people who are believers not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge but they're trying to seek justice and justice is not being served when people\nAre white about winter Sears falsely through things that\nYou know circling people or what about when their fears falsely through things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings and it is the\nAbsolute imperative for true people face the fight against it for those injustices so anybody who thinks that says if even chemical world is going to sit back from just\nA act like it's okay to the Savage rabbits and to strive for years I ever ...\nThe next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing moms they will go into churches and upset sermons then knock over all there is we can't prevent this and I think that we we see people a belief we people of traditional values\nHave to understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now I Want to stick to the positive and\nWe'll go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the street violence of the communist movements five believe politically is going to have a uh uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with the correct [noise]\nAbsolutely I I Do feel that this a blue wave or is it may be closely over estimated never going to see a huge turnout from Republicans and conservatives who are beginning to wake up for\nThis is no time to sleep that after we saw what happened to have it on here is the attempt in five\nJust destroyed the processes and Michael my comes down to it let's be real clear\nWhat's at stake here is whether or not we have a system of government in which we decide things five ... five\nThe reason we're having all these issues is because the Democrats have refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen elections and we planted that way with it if we reward them for their bad behavior you get more of it\nIs the same thing when you raise your child or train it off and say you reward you get more out the behavior of the concert French you get less ... have your other ... yelling the violence the attacks physically and otherwise the lines that struck fitness freak\nCannot rewarded we got to go out when elections from what you're talking about earlier or there has to be the legal consequences for the people who engage in this absolutely\nA hundred percent or so and\n... and and again Governor Huckabee I I I'm admirer the work you're doing on trinity TV I look forward to being what you are later on
