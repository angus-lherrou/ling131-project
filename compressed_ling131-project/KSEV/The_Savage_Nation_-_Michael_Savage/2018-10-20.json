is a joke or a smoker midnight poker President Trump loves being in front of an audience and basically his shtick is a comedy routine which has its upside and downsides let the president doesn't rally like President Obama would go out and make some speech the president goes out there and you just rich for an hour\nAnd it's usually very entertaining in a lot of folks have been to President Trump's rally they say it's a lot of fun\nObviously the crowded there and a half of the time it really is kind of a political rally in half a comedy routine because from the highly entertained him well sometimes that has upsides and sometimes that has downsides because like all Canadians when President Trump gets a ripping sometimes the good\nAnd sometimes he is just going to put his foot so far down his now that it comes out his call in and out his rear end and back around again sometimes he grades in Aurora on human physicality\nSo here's the good sometimes you get President Trump gates that like it's like they're just kind of funny to President Trump and the woman in the crowd and she shouts I Love you and here was President Trump's response\nFlyers guys but Democrats are aren't I Love you too [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's finally a woman you know I get it from the mental [laughter]\nEvery guy that said I Love you but you're not my time\n[noise] I finally earned it from a woman's eye to\nEye on that is funny though that's money and they're going to a break that down all its 'cause he ... it can be funny okay that's a funny thing to say but the funny thing is that\nThe problem is you have the president is actually a performer Donald Trump they perform and he spent his entire like being a performer as someone who performs onstage I Know it's like you play to the crowd the crowd that's in front of you responds with cheers\nAnd they respond with booze their time with laughter and you're constantly trying to keep them up and President Trump even that is when he was a candidate Trump he would say that he go to a rally and if he was on his stump speech and three quarters of the way through speech and he looked for it would just start saying build the wall and they got people all jacked up like he actually said that he performs like a performer\nWell the problem is that when you perform like from the president\nDoesn't actually have a fully functional brain to mount filter like that filter is is pretty ... hey whatever starts here ends up here\nAnd it doesn't matter what started there is one of the ... is one of the good things about the president planes authentic when people like authenticity in politics\nReading his authentic feeling is because he's not going to take on the same way that my four and a half year old is up and if you think that it comes out the way it is like there's no pretend\nThat good in politics because it's honest right you get the feeling that he got an evil like Iran and stuff that Trump said that it gets on his heels on it because he actually believe that at the time he will say that Trump is just going out there and he's lying for ...\nDonald Trump believed everything that Donald Trump that that doesn't mean everything that Donald Trump said is right or actual but it is authentic exactly go inside a from a problem is\nSometimes the dock that go through the ad\nShould not come out the mouth and that happened yesterday um twice actually\nSo he was talking about Greg ... who is the ... in Montana congressman and a and ancient Japanese rally\nAnd the president aside you know be a great idea to pray at that time the

and Jim forgot mad and he went full\nMacho man ready to Abidjan him\nRight one full undertaker he like grabbed him by than at any slammed into the brown and just caught on tape and then he had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor\nPresident Trump and you know what I'm In front of a crowd and said that we want to talk about that thing you know this is an issue that really needs to be out on the

the president's big\nMove on with regard to ... under cutting the higher level of half freeway some regards to democratic violent rhetoric we'll talk about that my little jumped in the mail bag as well you're listening to venture bureau [noise]\nWell I don't think the actual genius I always attribute to stupidity what I cannot attribute them out and\nThink what we're watching here as President Trump just saying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and think you put things in response to do I think that because President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think are crazy and he drives them crazy and he's good at at poking them but\nThey have a unique capacity to pull his chest knocked out of the fire he'll say something\nAnd then the media overreacting it's so insane and you go I guess I can say with those people so hearing CNN CNN drawing a comparison link between President Trump praising ... and the murder of democracy Augie by the Saudi Arabian government you\nKnow stupid you'd have to be to make the point is that the Iranian government has been murdering people and you know their entire existence they've been murdering dissidents and journalists for literally decades but it was only from\nWhat is going to go all the Trump came around and this is department so annoying that media yes from says dad thing I guess what the world is also a rock band played before President Trump was born and before he was president the world when it starts spinning the moment the Trump President Trump was elected heresy in and help though trying to attribute the spike\nIn treatment that journalists in place like Saudi Arabia to Trump as it from the dictator of Saudi Arabia\nAnd at that rally last night will play for you to president phrase the body slamming I Need a guy who can do a body slamming like that so why does it matter well you might think that it's all for your journals and any circumstance is bad but remember\nThree weeks after the apparent murder in this member of the end of Washington Post journalist Jim all tissue on you and the president we should note acknowledged that it certainly looks like this column if you did at the same time\nRefuses to condemn the Saudi regime for the ...\nOkay so if you think that President Trump is okay with the murder of journalists because he said something about ... you know and if you think that President Trump and suddenly driving press members around the world and he killed because he didn't like the Russian government needed a cue from us\nLike I don't remember the sort of talk about President Obama when journalists were being killed all around the world under his watch those little generally being killed around the world under his watch but because he didn't say this kind of public ... there was no linkage well\nThere's still no Lincoln but from some dumb things\nIs the obvious you know answers to do all the ... the worst example this came courtesy of Joaquin Castro one of the Castro brothers who wants to end it who wants to run for president walking is just the other all the other one and nobody cares about that much and he was on CNN\nHe suggested that President Trump's administration had literally Greenland the murder of ... by the Saudi Arabian government and then he would kind of using the gym forte commented as evidence of\nThat let me go to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting the jury crush or may have with us in trouble or just delivered a shooting with an enemies with\nTo the ground troops to envy or Saudi Arabia and that proves that may have acted on that and one of the people that he took actually down arguments are concerned you're\nThat didn't happen Jared Kushner did not and they hit list to the Saudi Arabian government and tell them to go murder journal and there's no evidence of this and I like how ... percent there's a rumor going around\nA ruin going around the walking Castro dismembered babies and eats them in the backyard I'd have to provide any evidence for this rover is just a rumor\nHeard it around and ... this is why Trump will continue to win so long as people do not treat him with the proper level of objectivity and by the way under company does not mean moral tension when he does that stop that means that if you respond like a duck to his comments and doubled down on you know in a second\nAnd we're going to get to more of all of that\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress do for somebody else\nHe would plead guilty plea quitting and takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference it to the perfect

over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or to once again he would sleep dot com slash a bureau use that flash Shapiro's they know we tell you already jumped\nMeanwhile as the media continue to wildly overreact and blame President Trump for the murder of a Saudi journalist I Would like to make one note about this particular topic okay when it comes to the murder of the Saudi journalist couple of things one of the people who are most loudly criticizing President Trump\nFor his treatment of the Saudi Government or people who were absolutely in the pocket of the Iranian its members of the the former Obama administration who want in the middle east can be controlled by an Iranian hedge Amman spreading its power from Afghanistan and eat to Lebanon in the west and south Yemen\nIs Obama characters who are saying that Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United states now should they be serious consequences to an ally\nIt's worth saying the Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United states now should there be a serious consequences\nAn allied murder of a journalist of course there should be but I'm not gonna take\nAt face value the complaints from turkey an actual despotism that has arrested hundred and fifty thousand us and in the last two and a half years I'm not going to take at face value their complaints that human right now I'm not going to take at face value complains about human rights from a bunch of people were propped up and gave them billions of dollars to the worst human rights violators and dictatorship on planet earth outside of North Korea\nI'm not going to do that so to think any one donor journalist and there is any consequences and also that doesn't mean that we have an ... we in the United states have an interest in undermining an alliance with the Saudi Arabian on behalf of the Iranians the way that the Obama administration wanted\nTo do okay you know what\nI I Can't handle emotions you can mail back which is email that's okay but you know too much too much that's all right now that guy Jones says\nHey man who do you think is the favorite to win them at twenty twenty democratic nomination in addition horse and people you think Trump would be handling election working people you think he was troubled any bank and love the show okay so in the category of people he would be handling Cory Booker\nHe would mess up Cory Booker right part of the kids would go down harder than a journalist in the hands of ... the president ...\nCory Booker is mechanical an awful awful at his job he ... he posed as a moderate and he actually the radical left him\nAnd he like Hillary Clinton he actually like a bad version of a robot you're not even like a good like he won the Alvin from Terminator you'd like to early version of ... out a lot it kind of broke down on the battlefield in heat who are like gizmo from some of those old series he he's he's not\nYou can't even see every gives hurting for Cory Booker\nBand was very data gaps in front would finish him because ... is the most inauthentic candidates and ... terrible candidate I think that Trump would also want somebody like Eric Garcetti the LA mayor who pretend to be cool but it actually just adored sending Trump would would destroy him pretty quickly um I think that the most dangerous candidate for him\nWould have been all over the floor and she didn't implode because like frankly I thought there's a lot smarter politically then she has\nAnd I was shocked to watch her set herself on fire sending smoke signals to the rest of the world that you didn't know what she was doing and just sat there it's energy pee on fire and I didn't understand why she would do that but she's kind of taken herself out to be smart candidate circle\nWould say right now of any top democratic contenders most dangerous and still Biden because it's hard to destroy guy who's been in the public eye that well\nIt ... but if it's a ... is that everybody has an opinion on it which means nothing that you say about him changes anybody's mind if you say that Donald Trump the dad with lemon everybody got right when you yep okay and you think Donald Trump said think sometimes that are really bad and the more like well yeah we didn't hear we know and if you say that Donald Trump\nShot a man on Fifth Avenue they'd be like\nSome kind of probably okay by like ... and he he really is right that was the truth from ...\n... high name recognition and a history of skeletons in your closet means that it's very difficult to actually destroy somebody politically\nIf they've dealt with a skeleton in their closet and obviously that Joe Biden has been out there for a long time there's not a lot out there that had known about Joe Biden that making dangerous also he does have blue collar appeal and a lot of states that Trump won places like Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania\nThat it sort of Biden territory democratically thinking somebody would be dangerous candidate show when from central won by ... I don't think that's right Kamala Harris I have yet to see so Kamala\n... she is much better at working the Cory Booker is\nShe also happens to be somebody her downside is that she had that kind of\nAbsolutely clean clean as the driven snow image in a lot of the public mind that she's just a prosecutor a hard nose prosecutor asking the tough question I think when people start digging into queen characters in politics they don't they claim for a long and President Trump is a master of throwing dirt on people's him he's just great at it so I I think he would fare okay against Kamala Harris okay let's say jokes I\nEver saying goes wait till man's heart is somebody some of what food does your wife making falls under the jak him any food that signal event\nOkay so I have to be honest about that my wife has called me three meals in the last ten years\nThat have because my wife is a doctor that means that she's incredibly busy and she has not actually cooked meal very often at all early in our marriage\nThe way to my heart when through boiling ravioli like it's literally that they just go to start paying some pre packaged ravioli it was pretty spectacular whoever is sending a man and the weight on as hard it through the stomach\nA message from the U.S tire Manufacturers Association\nWere conservatives find their voice am somewhat my birthday as all Houston\nVoice of Texas [noise]\nNews is our from town hall dot com ...

a letter to the university researcher this year why did still alive\nTV's not jobs they they thrive on the indulgence of our stupid political correctness\nI think there should be allowed or if you're a terrorist year immediately knocked off the face of the earth and the most humiliating and public way possible and that the viewership rights are sold so that there can be restitution for the victims\nAnd I don't know it's just you know it just didn't like what the tasted the pirates back in the day to to ward off piracy right they would hang them off the coast I Know because I didn't ancestor was hung up the Carolina hang them off the coast\nI'm moving on\nMexico dispatched to blowing seven twenty seven full of federal police officers to intercept that migrant caravan from Honduras heading to the United states that's kind of a change\nFrom Mexico I probably had something to do with the fact that Trump said that everything would be affected for trades or border closing and apparently means called leaf city not stopping a bunch of food and you're fat face or a letter of informing UK Parliament that means cause teens obesity\nYeah three churches that law Ferraro university sent a letter to an English parliamentary committee saying that means lead the teenager obesity not fat kids eating a bunch of food\n[noise] this is why aliens don't visit us coming up believe all women unless you're a Democrat we got another another infant and presenting to you to male version of Alexandria ...\n\nI always had with a range with pre loaded mad but it's amazing how fast you can go through all those rounds they're nothing more aggravating and having to stop and reload everything when you\nGet into a good read them you know when you find your focus in your concentration and you're just really on top of acquiring your target and you want to get right back into it instead of having to stop\nAnd reload mad the miniature to work and what I call it\nTake a look at your old speed letters and be honest about it they will blame compared to the ... this is literally the fastest letter in the world and if you doubt me for even attacking you got to go to love max fast dot com\nAnd see the video for yourself for thirty bucks is the best money you can spend on the range and I'm telling you from personal experience once you have this HGF loader you're never going to love the same way again load on the whole mag in less than three I Can't\nOh my God\nHe went and him can you imagine him and his brother their mom founded ... she was a co founder of La Raza\nThey're crazy oh my God\nI don't even know if they do we know if it was never really on I don't even know\nMaybe that's why they got good night\nNo the ah who early on was the one who gave the twenty twelve keynote\nAnd that's one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to groom them watch it I said it years ago I've always had my I I've had my eye on them for years\nSo I'm telling you and his brother's us rap Julio Castro the former\nMayor and it was at that than Antonio river walk that they switched him out I listen to my favorite one of my favorite story got a politics\nAnd walking like I you know that we look like and people were going and they were screaming at what they thought was moving on Castro but he had gone to a fundraiser he dropped out he goes to them what is it goes scene if you put your identical twin and your place maybe not and then he put why king there to wave at everybody and act like he was a twin brother\nAnd then he hit ... walking Castro's they well they were yelling at me and I would go back no which was keen for that nobody believes that [laughter]\n[laughter] oh man who would've thought I\nWas there as a foreign policy analysis oh my word\nBut yeah that he they are legit the they are the uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nAs who they are [noise] man\nSo that's just if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign\nAnd then you have the story a you have what ... you would spend the Internet and\nDid you hear some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\nSo power line had a great ... a write up of this and I think that\nAgain it's not a whisper campaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there is German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or the operative\nAnd that he was a because of its association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via the J media that ah and he was in his laments that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is totalitarian state\nAnd\nThat he was bitterly opposed to their approach to the state of Israel and he backed up he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence\nWhich we know it back on the Senate 'cause he treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four\nSeven so we know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually have the tweet saved so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much cautioned being used in drawing conclusions about all of this because the and tell us dabble Schmidt I just don't trust them with the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist\n[noise] so I mean I don't know if they're ... and I don't know if that's off if but here's the thing if he was a middle aged operative wind the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\nAnd the New York times this is what I'm ... the New York times said about cars showed him\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSome of the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing columns to the Washington Post heroin asks why would the posed enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself by contributing columns\nThe New York times describes him as a quote political Islamic to quote forged a personal bond with President ... of turkey why would the post a huge as a columnist and Islamic pal of ear to one\nAnd New York times also added that according to the show Gabe zone friends he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledge that he quote remained calm converse in in a conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that was saying that by the way that wasn't and I have the link I have the story right here it it ran just on the fourteenth so that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that the New York times to their credit legit asking some questions or or\nPutting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this\nGuy and I think that's a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated\nThan just the crown prince wrote a couple of columns by some duty to liken decided to kill him\nI mean look look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his ...\nSeriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue\nI've just really don't believe that they did and if so why would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking and build it links to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the dang consulate distant did\nThe he goes to the Saudi Arabian constantly and turkey is general and then you have one of your other who is always with you know the crown prince ... he goes in there shortly after\nThat pretty brazen now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he had gone on this charm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I think I\nI Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo a particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of drugs it off\nBut\nI think that after this charm offensive there's more than than just he's you know punch drunk on power\nThere's more to it than that because you don't go to this you don't go to this is the fact that this length go all over the United states and you know show how you're really getting a unveiling\nReforms women are driving your rolling back some of your your other regulations on you know take Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support a a if the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab\nWorld in that region that's huge so why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like that was there a sense of urgency where's there's something else happening\nI mean that's one of the world led to that and I think that's the big question\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was the New York times that was saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nNew York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they run a profile of me I actually like the report I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local nut job to try to do pieces on me and end up writing San thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nUm but they're not even though they're biased and they make mistakes\nI don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was the worst that's it and they're not a conservative publication so power\nThat that the narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in the way of asking the bigger questions why\nWould the crown prince gamble all of everything that he had built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe in the New York times had written that he was an Islamic here just to see what the Muslim Brotherhood and he was apparently working to have an Islamic all set up a U.S air authoritarian state to replace the Saudi monarchy\nI mean is that what it was I think it's legitimate to ask these types of questions and that's why it comes into play\nWe're going to talk to Dr ... about this next hour because this is his wheel house and I'm like I said I just think that there there's something more there\nSo and then what happens if it turns out yeah that it was you know the Saudis did it and not only did they do it with the crown prince apparently knew of it then then what happens most of the thoughts on that as well so we have all of that still to touch on and uh we will in the meantime Cal Tech is a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation -
