these stories ... ... a pool together ... machines and and NBC and CBS where Charlie Rose\nDoing the same thing can we not be a little suspicious cannot be a little suspicious of the way this narrative is unfolding we're being told from Washington only four percent of their time is spent getting a cabin outside of the story only four percent\nAnd can't we knew a little bit suspicious these are the people who burying Teddy Kennedy telling us what a wonderful tendons were weeping for Teddy Kennedy today said Andrea Mitchell the limited if she'd live married to a company who he left to drown\nWhat would have been given a lot of comfort in your old age from a law passed by Teddy Kennedy can we not be a little suspicious of the narrative these people were sending are selling new ... these abusers trying to tell us that we are the bad guys it's utterly ridiculous coming up Michael malls to talk\n[laughter] I mean headline not why not ... by the way just in case you want to blame\nThe editor of that pie since I was a ... a headline she writes in the article what we have every right to hate you you've done is wrong hashtags because patriarchy is long past time to play hard at fourteen feminism and to win\nAnd not just the Washington Post the New York times recently hired Sarah Jong the up to their editorial board syringe on I Can't read\nAh everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family program she did say white men or bowl\nOr she said oh man and sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men ... those are some of the more polite things that she said about men goes on and on and on there was a there was an outcry from reasonable people I mean to say conservatives\nTo say are you really going to let this woman on your board they said absolutely and then Twitter which is now censoring hate speech gave her a little check mark because she has now I'm a big important\nFirst you know and whenever you choose them exist whenever you actually hold up to them they always say well it's not often that this is just this feminist here in Athens there but that to me is like a mobster saying we're not all hitting them only we only have one or two hit men\nBut you know they control everybody you know they have these people and you know denounce them well one of the room with\nThat's right and you say it's not all feminists it's just the public one\n[laughter] I just didn't want to I Would even say it's just\nTheir leaders but it's not even just their leaders if leaders of feminists in all of these areas so one excuse or there was a magazine I probably can't even say this on the air or a female dog magazines and uh and they said that all of these things hashed I hate all men has five minute rush it's just for formative mid century but\nUh well it is certainly being performed but then you look at people like that Hawaii senator uh Mazie Hirono who says men need to shut up it's time for them to shut their mouths and do something good for a change you know other than creating civilization\n[laughter] other than forming our policy is\nShe wouldn't you think she will pay any price for that with an electorate that I assume it's half now\nWell I yeah I think her poll numbers will go up because her her base I mean Hawaii is quite far to the left\nAnd so her base where these feminist men and women and you know there there were sixteen hundred men who took out an ad in the New York times full page ad to say that they believe all women and they're the good ones era you know they're not the bad guys and\nBut it goes it's all over the place even the ones who say we're just kidding a Huffington Post at a piece on this uh what women mean when we say that men are trash is a close\nCan actually be directly translated into masculinity has in transition and it's not and moving ... fast enough and this is what they're really talking about this is where academia is coming in that's where these a senator senator runners coming in is they're saying no no it's not it's not all of masculinity it's\nToxic masculine\nA town that raised as fashion show the CDC\nHas a study of toxic masculinity\nAnd uh what what they what they define it as that comes from hedge demonic masculinity this is a gender theory a which is that a ... has your Monica masculinity from orange W Connell formerly Robert Conley is a transgender guy\nWho's now a and he's now a academic and he says that if the oppressive characteristics of masculinity boys and men must assuming perform to be considered a real man\nWe like to say what defending the country and fires and things like that going on taking\nCare of your family I don't know I'm ... and so that's what they're getting ... and ... and then as a result of all this academia all of his activism we're getting these bogus statistics the CDC and saying that in America one in five women is raped\n... if that were they I mean I ... or they might be studying downtown ... or ... or Chicago is half\nBut according to the national crime victimization survey that the actual number is an order of magnitude less at the most\nSo you've got in a in a culture where you've got it worth permeated by lives lives by the media life by politicians life by academia or you're going to get a culture that says men are trash the trouble is the reality just doesn't match up\nAn old old that's all just a second this radio show is just one small corner of venture bureau world you want to hear more\nShould head over to daily water dot com we can catch up on any Ben shows

not there but it does create a pretty ugly politics when I mean this is a you know this is a tension that goes back to the ancient Greeks that that we're getting a sort of life has brought a situation there were the b._b._c. random interview with a few mothers\nAnd the question was why his feminism affected the mother son bond a mother was interviewed she said she was furious because she gave her her little boy\nGender neutral toys you know dolls to play with or this or that\nBut he gravitated toward that traditionally male toys guns and army men and that sort of thing and she's furious over this what is she to do\n... I mean is that ... million studies about this for kids in this without any training whatsoever now\nOf course they do and I got to tell you your your Prager video come out of the right time last year feminism was the Merriam Webster\nWord of the year that she was the end uh unsurprisingly so but I Can't imagine\nThat this can go on forever there's got to be a turning point here because what they're doing is is they're creating this uh the sense of panic based on lies and and slander and they're in this case obviously destroying a good match reputation and Brett Kavanaugh how long can that persist\nBefore people of good faith and reasonable the apple and a half a half of the global population those men say a week we can no longer tolerate this this is a vicious as violence is based on life\nYou know it's funny I had friends who had two boys and they wouldn't let them play with guns so the boys took a piece of wonder bread without the center and made it into a gun and shot each other Michel laws from the Michael Moore show thanks so much for coming on a great job and I will be listening to your show later on benefit or I mean I\nI you know one of the things I've noticed about young men I work of round a lot of people were much younger than I Am and I've noticed that when we talk about when and this is what men talk about you know and then talk a lot of other ones\nThat we stay in the same thing we notice that women has the same traits we can see them with our eyes and experience and then white\nBut the younger men are angry about it ... me about the trace of women and older men tend to talk about the prince of women with great affection so if you say that women for example women are more emotional than that that is true women are more emotional and\nMost of us older guys kind of find that farming and delight phones and it's kind of softens our lives that a woman in our life softens our lives a little bit because it reminds us that emotions play a part in life and what you pay attention to the\nYounger guys feel somehow cheated by this and of course it only took me a while to figure out the reason is the younger guys had not been told nobody told them everybody told them men and women are the same any difference you've seen societal induced okay\nAnd so they they're aiming winning leaving shaded they've been lying to the same is true of women that used to be that women told their daughters watch out for them they have a very very powerful sex drive they lose their heads stupid stuff there's sometimes cruel some of them are bad guys you have to really pay attention to this\nYou know and once you knew that he understood that when you were dealing with a good man when you were dealing with a man who didn't have that way you know we're dealing with somebody who had a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand that women were in fact other people you know and I think that is very hard very hard for young men when they are awash\nIn testosterone to get that through their heads in the very hard enough for them not to think like target you know there was a hard target females or get females [laughter] that's what that's everything in their body to tell him to do that\nSo girls were warned and they were told and then they learned that men most men most men are pretty good you know most men are putting them especially when they're sober most men are pretty things and they they learn to respect that as well and they learn to respect immense power and they learn to respect his strength\nWould lie about what people are\n... makes people angry when they discover the truth because one of the biggest problems with the left is they wonder why they want to tell us things aren't the way they are oh Islam religion and you know they want to tell us that and then ...\nAnd we start in general I think twice as more and twice twice as much instead of saying oh you know some some forms of Islam are not so peaceful\nYou get serious with everybody and moving to the state we find ourselves and they have lied to us the feminist lied to us about what men are they like it was about what women are and not everybody has\nThe building campaign died or\nWere conservatives find their voice am someone Hubbard KFC all used to\nPoint of those [noise]\nThose is our

Rachel Mitchell noted that she did not name cabinet until now\nUntil now um\nApparently Emma brown at the Washington Post because remember Dr Ford gave the Washington Post or therapists notes but she would not give the committee that's determining if she is she's looking to report information about Brett Kavanaugh the committee that's making a determination as to whether or not having all going to be on the Supreme Court she's refused to give that committee her therapist notes\nI Wonder why\nWell lemme brown over at the Washington Post noted that Ford did not named Kavanaugh and any of the notes\nThat's why\nSo she provided the Washington Post with her therapists notes but the committee making a decision on the actual nomination of the Supreme Court justice she refused to give than her note but one thing to consider the fact that her no she says corroborate her testimony\nBut they can't see the notes but just trust her that the notes corroborate everything that she's telling that but you can't see the notes literally that is what the lay of the land is\nBut the Washington Post as she didn't mention Kavanaugh she was not the only time\nCabinet ever came up with after the news broke that he was the nominee he would not ever mentioned in her notes\nThat missiles that memo outlined there was NO NAME and the twenty twelve marriage therapy note NO NAME given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy note\nAnd it took thirty six years for him to for his name to emerge and\nSo that's I mean I I just I don't know I'm a\nMitchell notes quote Dr four testified that she told her husband about a quote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she and her husband that she was a victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\nSo forward um Mitchell says at Ford was changing her description of the incident to become less specific\n\nAh Mitchell says she noted that there was no memory of who invited her to the party how she heard about it really where it was how she got to it\nAnd um\nDid not know how she got home she did not know if she made a phone call she did not know she talked to anyone else at there after an quote I'm Mitchell also noted quota according to her letter to Dr Feinstein or to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford her judge Kavanaugh in March\nAccording to her letter to Dr Feinstein or to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford her judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party go downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged the salt but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nUm\nShe also noted Mitchell also noted that the number of people at the party was inconsistent and kept changing uh originally there were four boys at the party and that was and then there were four boys and a couple of girls\nAnd their and that's that's what that that's what the the trouble is and Mitchell noted that her reasons for coming forward are inconsistent ah she said that\nJohn Mitchell knows caught the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or husbands who she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker\nShe testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and to the president she did not contact the Senate however because she claimed she did not know how to do that yes she does not explain how she knew how to contact representative and that issue but not her senator\n[noise] ah the she can't\nRecall and this was what kept coming up with Michel ... she apparently took the her polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral or right after her grandmother's funeral\nAnd ah\nThe reason that Michel focus so much on that is because she says quote it would be inappropriate to administer a polygraph to someone who's grieving because polygraphs are already so unbelievably unreliable that's why they're in admissible in a court of law at any sort of evidence\nUm she also\nThere was all a win win ... Michel noted that there were some discrepancies in terms of the effect that the trauma had and she doesn't know if it was because you know the lawyers are affecting us or what it was but does she noticed there were there were twelve rather large inconsistencies and all of\nThat and that the post article says that Kavanaugh isn't named and in the therapists notes\nBut yet for wants to the Senate Judiciary committee the committee to believe that Kavanaugh was named in the notes that she said are her biggest piece of evidence corroborating her story\nYet she won't give them the nose so that's huge she also doesn't know during the polygraph video or audio recorded and they have no idea what questions were asked so this is why progressive or just attacking\nRachel Mitchell um relentlessly right now so I you know I just it's I'm a\nPretty it's just I'm inconsistent\nSo when I hear people like Lisa Bloomsday well there is evidence and they're testing the testimony is inconsistent and that's according to the the third party that was brought in\nThere isn't any evidence to corroborate any of this information there isn't even did the ... named witnesses don't even corroborate a the named witnesses are actually disputing the of events\nAnd the alleged occurrence show all of that and they're doing so on record under penalty of felony\nWhich ah that's that's pretty significant\nThat's pretty significant\nSo now they're ... they're Democrats or further moving the goalposts because the whole cabinet rapist isn't sticking Kavanaugh's of serial rapists isn't sticking\nHim hosting gang raped isn't sticking so now they're trying to say oh well he was not consistent or he was um not truthful when he was discussing about his alcohol consumption so now they're moving to alcohol consumption because of rape charges aren't sticking\nSo that the new thing that's what they're doing this week and they're going to spend all week trying to shore up that new talking

but again getting back to a McCarthy and the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\n... years later there was a publication and titled living on a papers V E N O N I wrote about it in one of my previous books\nAnd the va noted papers were written by former KGB agents and they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren facts Soviet operatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty\nAnd so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism were warned

cabin or for having too many beers in high school how does that work\nMaybe investigation and see what\nI think so I think that maybe there's some FBI investigation that she'll be thought of every senator on the committee who's become a new a new a new which hunter I Would invite an FBI investigation of Blumenthal not just about as Vietnam record\nBut about his finances why should we look into why should we not look into what senator whose fortunes have grown cheddar fifty fold since they came into office why is that not fair play\nFair game rather for investigation I think it's long overdue for an FBI investigations of every senator on that committee whose falsely accused capital and see if we can find out how their fortunes have grown so greatly er during that time you were in office how did that happen\nIf the only only the mass media would participate in that [noise]\nWell I'm participating in a while I still can't I'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria which arrive
