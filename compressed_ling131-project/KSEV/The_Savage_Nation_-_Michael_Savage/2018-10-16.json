not for Krabbe\nBecause clearly that was something the Cherokees made back in the day crab\nHe noted crab heard of the Oklahoma plane that her aunt that's aren't you done one of the war and told the story over and over about her Native American ancestry and what she said was that there are rapist members of her family couldn't accept our parents' romance because\nWas it their rapist members of her family couldn't accept her parents' romance because her mom was partially Native American here's Elizabeth Warren telling the romantic story\nActually rolling about what it is I Believe you were

issues for somewhere [noise] and um [noise] after fighting as long as they go to my parents went off they love\nOkay tell her parents alone because her mom was part Cherokee and Delaware\nWhich means you would think pretty hefty notes of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if her family is worried about it then it sounds like that would be to significant Native American ancestry\nSo President Trump didn't believe that because it's nonsense that people actually checking her background they found there is no Native American ancestry anywhere in the in the time horizon of rationality\nDo President Trump went out on the campaign trail or did back in twenty Seventeen I Believe and he was holding a rally in Montana and he suggested that he would give her a million dollars if she could prove or Native American ancestry and we want to say\nFor like ... if you take the test to the show you're there you know [laughter]\nSo today Elizabeth Warren came forward when the

headline today from the Daily Beast suggests that there is strong evidence that she is Native American\nOr is it it's at the actual title Elizabeth Warren DNA tests revealed Native American ancestry

from pertain to President Trump has been from the bathroom\nHillary Clinton just how bad that Hillary there is no such thing is that Hillary Hillary came out over the weekend the Senate Bill Clinton should not have resigned over Monica Lewinsky because he did not abused his power in any way I Do walk and she is considered a hero\nOr heroine feminist movement pretty spectacular stuff from the left here here as Hillary Clinton\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power no\nNo there are people who look at the incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an inch or in the power imbalance as to what in adult but let me ask\nYou this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nSo that so good so I I Love the Trump should resign because of allegations against him but her husband didn't resign because of allegations against him also he didn't have used our when he's forty nine years\nAnd but her husband should resign his allegations against him also he didn't have used our one he forty nine year old president of the United states was in service by twenty three year old intern in the oval office\nNone of these power anyway good to know that our imbalance is no longer a concern for ten minutes on the left very exciting stuff also Hillary important that President Trump and attacked it of course the reason that you know some of the fact that because Trump was mean to her\nIf she watched the way Trump debated me it was just interviews with access making fun of me for preparing for you know that feels like a little yeah the girl in the class who's always prepared I don't need to be prepared\nThat really without having to those ... what happened to the Trump was much much Arthur against every other human being on the planet and it didn't play well with her because she's one of the most deeply unlike them all human beings on planet earth\n... the Democrats have decided to full scale and break the most radical version of themselves\nYou know they they enacting we have to get in touch with your authenticity Democrats are certainly getting in touch with their authenticity the problem is that deep down democratic leadership not particularly charming\nBernie Sanders and it's another example that Bernie was on Jake Tapper show on CNN and Jake Tapper asked him about the inflammatory rhetoric on the part of some folks in the Democratic party and Bernie\nFollower of who's shot up a bunch of Congress people last year came out and said that it's not that bad as people get mobbed in public places like amazing the brain doesn't feel the need to say anything here about the sort of action\nYou know I I don't blame very generous for that incident last year because unless you are openly calling for violence I don't blame you for somebody going and doing violent but\nWhen Bernie Sanders refuses to condemn mumbling in public spaces you certainly is not making the country a better place\nWhere I Am very strongly in favor of mobilizing the American people\nTo stand up and fight for economic jokes that some social justice and racial and environmental jumps up and I think we have to mobilize people I Am not a great fan of being rude or disrupting activity but this was what I Will say\nThis entire two thousand election campaign it's going to come down to two words and that is voter turn up\nSo he is not a fan of people getting a lot of people get rid of that sort of the way that hadn't and voter turnout going and damp and enthusiasm\nIt just shows how Democrats are willing to work\nWith the mob politics they've been talking

of their class at West point\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln said you hardly just knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem and Lincoln said I don't

track meets now we've seen in a world cycling competition\nAnd the far left can't say anything about it because they have to admit that what they really are saying it's crazy let me get a shot in Chuck you are on the Savage Nation my name's Greg ...\n... ah you know to turn ... coming home to roost really became popular usage country when a war church or all the phony American indian at the University of\nColorado wrote a paper about uh nine eleven of curve because\nHe did use that expression I remember that for [noise] I said yes he did use that expression I it it became a you know growing up in the south that was a\nFairly common expression before war Churchill was here and Malcolm X used a very a famously in his autobiography but go right ahead\nYou know the story of war Churchill oh yeah he\nWell he I think almost all of a national you see emails between the ministry stray string theorists in Colorado and the faculty\nOne he applied for a job and email said well we have we have to get him a media we were going to lose ... to ... we need someone with his background if his credentials he was writing ... what he was a whole for all the totally fleet frost he had about the same\nUh Indian background and the Indian charged with ours got each log fire\nRemember that were the tribes said they they said that now they don't they're not claiming him and ... again it goes to this whole thing of identity politics this idea that because of your DNA or who your great great great grandmother was changes\nWho you are and how valuable you are just doesn't make sense that's not how we do it in America so it'd be like saying hey your dad was a serial murderer therefore you are a horrible person we don't do that right um but we do in front of the things\nLet's say that your great great great great grandfather was a slave owner that's your fault\nBut let's say your great great great great grandfather free the slaves is that your fault or is that something that you should uh I didn't mean to a fault of the opposite right and this has something you should get credit for\nNo you get credit for what you do when the United states of America it's supposed to be a merit based society it's supposed to be content of character and what you do when we create and what your actions are\nAnd yet we're turning it into this idea we're going backwards what used to be a very liberal idea I'm going to treat everyone the same\nI'm not gonna care what color you are I'm not gonna care whether you're a man or woman I'm not going to care what religion you believe in I'm not going to care where you came from I'm going to treat everyone I come in contact with the same they used to be very liberal idea\nNow\nIt's a very conservative idea the liberals say is a way to oppress people\nUsed to be a very liberal idea to say that\nThe way to not discriminate on the color is to treat everyone the same now they're saying if you treat everyone the same that's discriminatory\nThat's how crazy this world is going to ... down it's inside outs bizarro world and I was also telling you about that that live with one is not the only problem story for the Democrats\nGamble they go to this this is from ABC News and orders or no I'm Sorry yeah it is yeah sorry Washington Post ABC poll\nGeneric ballot in battleground districts the ones that really count the battleground districts where it's kind of you know we don't know who's going to win look we all know in the house everybody in the house is up for election every two years right\nAnd we all know there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Republican and there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Democrats I mean it doesn't matter you know the are going to win in this district the deal is going to win this district and it doesn't really matter who the names are and\nThen we get to the ones that are battleground districts where it's not up for grabs we're not sure who's gonna win this one and that's where the movement happens in the house of representatives so this Washington Post ABC News poll looked at those battleground districts\nAnd on the generic ballot right you've over Republican or Democrat the Republicans are up one\nDay it's red and white wine and so what kind of my wife is a\n... ... the Republicans are up on ABC News Richard Klein took a look at this\nThe double digit Democrat lead nationwide\nMakes everybody think in the far left area and the and the media and the Democrats but our ... myself that it's going to be this blue wave but when you got to look at is where the real battles are so here's a Klein says for twenty two days ago\nThey worry that a whole lot of the midterm enthusiasm a wind up a wasted in places they don't need the extra votes\nVery strong democratic areas right nationwide Trump has a forty one percent approval rating Democrats have a fifty three to forty two percent edge in the generic ballot for the house but you go to the district that are toss ups the sixty six districts\nThe lead evaporates and it becomes plus one for Republicans\nWow\nAnd by the way that means that the Democrats need eight twenty three seats flip to win the house they have to win forty five out of sixty six battleground districts\nTo in the house that doesn't look good that's the worst news they've heard in quite a while for weight I'm not done\nGo to bed or Rourke down in Texas and cruises up fifty two to forty five according to CNN\nLikely voters in Texas place immigration at the top of their issue last twenty six percent called the most important issue twenty three percent called the autonomy economy the top priority and cruise leads among both of those voters in the race and he's winning fifty two to forty five but hey the good news for Beto\nHe's got thirty eight million dollars he raised for his candidacy but the Democrats want to share the only thirty two million dollars sure O'Rourke says well I'm going to say exactly what ... says about his money that he raised for his race when the Democrats want it\nThat's about his money that he raised for his race when the Democrats want it and then

yep\nI mean if you don't like your approach I mean that's that's going to be really hot ask going to be really cool\nReally do you think so\nHey five five four hundred Savage you get you on board the program paid five five four hundred Savage and you're on board and hey have you been paying attention to the stuff with the hurricanes okay\nI live in Florida so when I hear that stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming I I said what and when I saw President Trump on Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said why would somebody brief President Trump because the truth as there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when you saw said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said\nRoy Spencer\nPHD because Roy Spencers been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville\nHe's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people and he does it with facts from our own government\nAnd he's a he's got this out inconvenient data no trend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated a plot of Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing and it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and that includes hurricane Michael\nAnd here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does new excuse me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is downward but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not offered so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that the hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoyd the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so expensive points out well yeah but if you look at the history of July August September average the temperature\nYou'll see that since Eighteen sixty this summer\nIs only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico an out of the top ten warmest Gulf here since Nineteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is before we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature that Spencer points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael made landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand to two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words\nThere's been times in this plan of history where there have been more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today or long before so called global warming\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claims\n\nBy the way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data for that\nAnd when Roy Spencer PHD put Michael in his account of all let's all us landing major hurricanes it marked a downward trend since uh thirties forties and fifties not an upward trend not an upward trend\nAnd yet they still keep trying to make you think that is Massachusetts Bay colony and sixteen thirty five had a cat three or four storm with up to twenty foot storm surge\nHappened again and sixteen Seventy five you don't see those anymore\n[noise] until twenty Seventeen the United states when eleven years without a major hurricane strike according to a NASA scientists that was the one in one hundred and Seventy seven year event to not have it strike that for that long\nAnd yet we're being told that manmade global warming is increasing the number of storms and increasing the intensity and it's just not true based on the death\nAnd yet lovely song made it seem like Trump didn't notice talking about she was on the\nNew he didn't know what do you think\nOh one more one more victory for Trump is getting tired of winning\nHere's the headlines from Katie tablets Trump was right city council offices headed by the San Juan mayor has been raided by the FBI I remember when Trump came out and pointed out there was corruption in Puerto Rico and that there were local failures to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria last year\nWell during the recovery process with the feds San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz regularly came out slamming Trump\nAnd she would advocates my T shirt against them that you were to get on TV Now our officers have been rated by the FBI\nWhat's the operation was related to suspected corruption in the purchasing department say one way or Carmen ... Cruz said on Twitter the instruction is always total total her instruction up for this this total collaboration mhm right the administration and the mayor of San Juan\nIs being investigated by the FBI corruption charges\nTrump is right again\nThere was a lawsuit FBI reportedly launched an investigation following the February lawsuit filed by your the remote Leno\nFormer director of procurement and she claimed that she was retaliated against for reporting the alleged a regular axe to local controller I have friends in Puerto Rico and when I asked them about corruption they laugh\nBecause they're set of course there's corruption there's there's there's so much corruption you when you would be shocked at the amount of corruption Puerto Rico is a small island and it's all who you know and there's corruption like you would not believe I said he was a hurricane or for that especially with hurricane relief\n\nHey five five four hundred Savage get you on the program paid five five four hundred Savage and you are and I I Want to get the update of what's going on with the Democrats that are being caught lying in order to win in November against the latest one on that one my name's Greg napping for Savage this the Savage Nation\nMajority vote several just mention coal no eight five to four hundred seven eight bucks for for ... two servers\nSavage Nation of sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or switches America dot com\nOnly choice left to get the Japanese cell sunspots director for free listen for free for sunspots aged Boston even read inflamed patches I Love the genders all sunspots director says Renee from Boulder, Colorado she says it's my go to a product every day I have some spots an age spots\nI can see a definite difference in my skin since using it Renee from Boulder has been raving about the brand new genuine sunspots director and for the next two weeks all you can still get the sunspot miracle for free time is running out though to try this wonderful special\nWatchers sunspots vanish and your bags and profit is well gone after the results as little as twelve hours a genuine immediate effects is also yours for free so please go to John your cell dot com that I work all eight hundred and eight and I want so thinking order this week it receives Germany's luxury micro germ abrasion also free", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Tomball", "day": "16"}
