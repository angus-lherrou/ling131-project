story\nWhen they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses corroborate because that's money there are no witnesses to corroborate her testimony there talking point on the left that women would never falsified would never miss remember would never lie about allegations of right now I have\nTremendous sympathy for people who are alleged sexual assault\nI Do I mean when when she first came out I said this is a credible account and and I I Want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on it there's no corroborating evidence for coming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh kept it on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows 'cause there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWhat's that said one of the things that's been put out there by by talked on the left is that there is no incentive for women in high profile cases come forward\nI have two or three Anita Hill and you need a hell of an e Carol on the left for the last twenty five years HBO made it folds here is about her and if you think there's no incentive for women to come forward in shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful I mean given time magazine cover this week or the time magazine cover this week in a ... for swearing with her eyes closed and her entire fate is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who has not benefited at all from the publicity\nAnd I would say that Christine Blasey Ford is one of the most worship fingers on the left today so that's not an implication that you'd wind but just to get the incentives are all in one direction is just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nIt is true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but you also have an interest as he got the women don't have an interest in coming forward in high profile cases\nBecause all they are going to get is the downside is just it's not accurate it's just not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing protect doesn't mean she was lying but we ought to at least be honest about what the incentive structure is here our incentive structures are in place for allegations sometimes you may\nIf they weren't and he wouldn't have high profile cases when women come forward and say something and it turns out that they're offending\nOr making things up\nSo that is that at a point number one point over to their bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claims have nothing to do a cabin on and it's supposed to be ... the great ... piece in USA Today that one was promoting\nOn Twitter and what she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate and the reason that he shouldn't be on the court to remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court was that he was a conservative than the reason that he shouldn't be on the court is because you allegedly committed sexual assault that when there was no corroborating evidence you shouldn't that on the court because she was part of an angry as one of the USA Today that\nI remember my grandfather and that's why Brett Kavanaugh Russian sit

appeared in today's Washington Post explaining why she believes that judge Kavanaugh did something wrong\nI'd rather take all you know I'm not going to defend line I'm not going to pretend that Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean let's go through with a V. chip posted lied that rights have not told them from going going okay you're going going that far less site and so that means they're going to get\nAbout as comprehensive view was actually from media matters which is a comprehensive gives you can come up with a rat Kavanaugh's wise\nSo what are these impose allies have enough that he did not travel in the same social circles as board but\nHe did and then they said well he traveled in the same social circles well what's the evidence that some of the people she has run a party with her were on the calendar that's not the same social circles that six degrees of Kevin Bacon\nRight and that is putting that that's like saying that you know I travel in the same social circle of Kenya and therefore send your friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all\nAlso they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi ingesting he did not drink on weekday that's not true he said he rarely drink on weekdays and his own calendar and in fact you referred openly and in fact my calendar said on this day I probably drink I don't know I probably going to touch on my calendar\nHave enough that he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad in law school there but he was delighted ... admitting\nThat it's not really not aligned to the end that he and his grandfather lend to Yale in Nineteen oh eight\nNot here law school in jail and so that's that's not that's not actually I think what else citywide supposedly he lied about blacking out from drinking but he didn't live out that there's no evidence that he actually did blackouts and breaking\nNow the Democrats kept using blackouts and drinking because what they're ... they're attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford and just didn't remember the incident and that's what they are and something that you say but there is no actual evidence of that so there is no why they're either\nNow what you could say is that he was playing his his drinking in favor of all possible light I think that's fair but that's not the same thing and ed perjuring yourself and wine openly\nWill go through a couple of more of your ... lives the cab not called virtual our has a good rebels and the silver political as

nominate emitted sexual assault their ... and then they that we can't nominate him because\nOther women had been raped by other people who are not right ... ... and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with while he committed perjury he committed perjury as well one problem\nNo imminent he committed perjury so some of the other accusations they say that captured onsite in Maryland the drinking age in explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing that he said in his testimony he was too young to legally right it's in the drinking age Marilyn who they came to the testimony\nAnd then they get to the booth thing right so ... that it's a wide committed perjury charges of perjury for saying that in your book when he was Seventeen he used the word move to mean march and what it actually means is anal ...\nI'm not kidding this is what the actual airtime than what everyone knows that moving and saying oh I forgot I didn't know the booth and what was that that's where a also it turns out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word move also something I didn't know but there's been substantial research I'm moving\nAnd it turns out that there is no way to substantiate that as ally also need term devil's triangle so there is ingestion\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh was using a pornographic reference about two and huge and one girl and a three to him again he says that that was the drinking game it's usually pretty weird way to your your past and drunkenness to term devil's triangle of drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who said that they have heard of that as well\nAnd so they there's a bunch of people who said no he actually meant that now let's let's remember\nWhy is any of this material is only material because of the congestion by Democrats is that he put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means it's actually it's altered a girl when he was Seventeen that in another child as an insane line and then Cory it's an insane like have you ever read a Facebook page\nI think people have been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school\nIn my yearbook page was clean I Can't say the same for all my friends are there are references that people didn't necessarily understand in the yearbook pages and an orthodox Jewish state school and I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such references\nJackson telling ya you guys went to high school were there any obscure we're sexual references in your your book by dude yeah that's right too many to count\nWe're sexual references in your your book by dude yeah that's right too many to count it precisely the right answer because of course have you ever met a teenage boy I Love all the senators were broken allow going really well when you were Seventeen you wrote and your your book\nAbout drinking and making sexual references\nLike okay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever again and you have an ... year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero ... built by and Brett Kavanaugh downplayed that in the testimony that means he was a perjure cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's sixteen years old\nAnd they do here is pious and finally they narrowed down finally they narrowed down so what is ... now I think that that he lied when he said that he had a weak stomach the heat to throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol and or spicy food\nI also have a weak stomach I throw up a lot to\nThat could happen from drinking I've never thrown up because of bringing actually because I don't actually agree on but [laughter] but\nNow she had to make it out you know I Know I'm not I'm not desperate enough during ... that'd that'd be terrible\nBut if it's so finally they come down to one they've narrowed in on one thing one thing that the ... thing and that will find all the stuff\nThat just a bunch of nonsense then they narrow down to one thing in one thing only there is there only a credible claim in my opinion there only a credible claim that Brett Kavanaugh lied in his testimony their own a credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of ... about a woman named ... dolphin who's going to tend to overlook all girls high school\nNow or do you think you might need to know that we're in a dolphin before we actually get to the supposed ally right dolphin was good enough friend that Brett Kavanaugh that originally he signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good to girls when he was in high school she was on that letter\nLike she was friends with him for many many years and she signed that letter there's no accusation that she has talked to them in high school there's an occupation that he's actually assaulted her medical there's not a nation that he touch her in high school none so what exactly is the claim acquainted on fourteen boy your book pages there was a reference to Renee alumnus referring to her\nAnd other reference to suggest that ... that she was that this was a joke about among the merchandise among a bunch of guys can jet thing that they were alumni of her ... essentially the day that there's a bunch of that could have sex with her and when Kavanaugh was asked about that he said that this was an attempt a clumsy attempted affection among his friend\nBut that's that's what he said in his in jak testimony and I want to see if I can grab the actual act of testimony that I can find exactly what it is that that was that he was claiming but the the basic ingestion of 'em right cabinet as it is we're not in fact\nA reference to that with Renee alum near the rate of ... in fact with Renee golf in New York Times had a piece where they said that it was horrible and hurtful and here's what the New York times that\nThey tended to judge Kavanaugh classic dimensions of her and they were part of the football players unsubstantiated vote thing about their Congress and Kevin ... things up and that it was a clumsy attempt\nRight that it was a Columbia attempt at a passion now\nMaybe that is true and maybe that's not\nBut there's no way to catch it perjury first of all it's not material I reading materiality provision in the FBI and the deal to Emanuel and second of all\nIt's fair to say that a ... a a close ally here's how he prays that quote one thing in particular workout about one of our good one of our good female friend who would admire what dances with had her name used on our page with the term alumni and that's how most commonly used to show affection to show she was one of them\nThere was no way to catch it anything differently except it right away they could've gone and asked one of the other Thirteen guys and get your name on the pages it that would that lead\nThey didn't because you know why they couldn't find anyone to testify what it meant as we all had sex with Renee\nRenee dolphin so based on him being made about a year book phrase tours along when he was Seventeen that means you can't sit on the Supreme Court\nYeah no at that and a strong strong response Democrats and that's that's definitely what I think that that you're going to catch him and tell it it's pretty obvious to the point that the Democrats will do anything to stop this out right ... and it's pretty gross coming up the Democrats tried to make a last ditch effort to stop for having

ourselves as some say are we heading to the sixth\nExtinction on this planet I Know it's something that the great conservatives don't want to think about because by and large the conservatives in the radio business are as old fish on this issue as the Democrats are on Donald Trump\nWhat wildlife destruction is something that should concern all of us and conservatives mean\nConserve we should conserve our friends on the planet not destroy them very big story but let me begin with the mass hysteria of our time one paragraph if I could indulge myself for your listenership for one second\nWhich is what happened in sixteen forty to\nPerhaps the record holder for such criminality was one Thomas Granger\nWho was set to have had relations with the mayor of cow to go through sheep to capture the turkey overwhelmed by the sheer number in diversity of Granger allegedly beach they allocate the offended public raised no objections and he was executed that was during the Salem witch trials in the chapter from Plymouth Rock\nJust to the hall and stop mass hysteria in other words\nWhen we talked about the Salem witch trials on this program yesterday and I'm showing you the witch trials of today the witch trial of Trump the witch trial of deplorable ... the witch trial of capital as an example of a ... as a effect told him of all of us\nIt's really nothing new this happened in New England in the sixteen forty here and tragically it's happening again and it's an example of the hysteria that is driving the political narrative today the hysteria that began on college campuses by a group of radical psychotic feminists\nKilling the patriarchy has now a poison the entire body politic\nSo I'm going to ask you again who are in your opinion better for the most from the capital persecution\nNow many of you would think it's going to be a knee jerk reaction for me and said Republicans dead because the base has been agitated by this I'm not so sure as a matter of fact\nI Know two very successful conservative women who always been conservative not recently they didn't just regionally vote for Trump they'd be conservative since they young youngsters and they're not happy with capital would you believe that I was actually shocked to learn that\nThey don't like them they think he was angry I said what do you mean he was in other words they bought the line from the

government was so akin to what we're having in America today\nAnd it was so akin to what we're having in America today\nThe people felt good about it prostitution was the criminalized drugs what wrapping laws against venereal disease were dropped\nJust as an America would dropping laws against using heroin now first they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened in the wine or a public that is akin to what's happening in America today weakens police authority ramping lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated\nWhat else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about the backlash said this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the Y. or Republican Germany and uh you have groups like on the far the\nBerman cowards are put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and say I'm glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history lessons from history remember when I sent the many times those do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning for the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the fought today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the advocates of today had gone by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they're attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's just not what powers the ... to protect ourselves from these Vernon suddenly German said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany and they formed units called brown shirts\nAnd they started beating a communist the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen there don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you to be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest as this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou to know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts at some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAn opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing did you and I sent and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong because the left for like you to think he said let me see the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his delusions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there will be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point to my show tonight\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left which say any of its illusions of extreme to the left said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a good cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much beyond what college student in you know when he didn't what did they do in college what Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat do you drive by the shepherd's drank too much about a ... ... what do you what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy and went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an aberration\nWhat I'm saying to us history as a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the less than a super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong\nYou're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about\nTrust me on that she lives in what triggers at all if we have an economic blowout in in the west\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen that you can't believe are happening in what happens so fast you'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there is the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's going to happen and I'm afraid if it happens it'll be worse than ever biggest were the heightened now of stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I'd never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money and under the Democrats woman criticized deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dumb enough they shut their mouths you broke your anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money that's just crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that just doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit card\nIt's supposed to go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened and why mark Germany at the ... just before all of this that or take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that South value is the money or become\nNow several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down to run it you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company has not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America some of them posted by enemies or Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there were cycles to academy there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the one strike United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans

columnist denier so harsh this morning to sit down I have a cookie before economical you football where it would be yeah I Know more about football she knows about conservatism oh my gosh and that's just not a lot\nSo she had asked serious question doesn't that Romero count blah blah blah blah blah yeah they they\nThey interviewed her good job keeping up on the fact wants you to write a column about it but no one will read except division about good job keeping up with the fact they interviewed her you know they interviewed mark judge for eleven thousand hours I don't remember how long it was like ours though\nThat they interviewed him nothing there nothing there so\nThis was a ... so they they they made this talking with did they have is that while you know they didn't talk to the some of these people they're you know I Can't believe that there will be out and talked to some of these people wait a minute I'm Sorry you mean the people that you told just like\nA year ago like a year ago or a couple of months ago after the guy's name came up that oh well I think he did something to me those people who heard it thirty six years later and they heard it secondhand you think that that's a corroborating witness\nPray tell are so high\nI just have to ask you got\nI mean it's what what the hell\nLike Democrats sometimes think that the FBI will be Keystone Cops for them\nNow than there are not happy with the FBI you remember that organization that it was essentially a thin to criticize just a couple of weeks ago Cain actually just a week ago do you remember them all sitting there like sketch these on that panel\nDark critical reference you'll remember them sitting on that panel and they were saying oh my gosh we love to have the FBI\nThat to gauge it is the outlet esteem bold set the FBI investigate this I mean ... all of these lobbying accusations we must remedy there\nBy in stealing the authority of investigation into the FBI because they will get to the bottom of it is Oh yes and then they all murder and amongst themselves oh\nAbsolutely we must have them there I say chatting and Grassley we'd chateau to vote on on this individual out and have we have Sarah investigation by the math\nAnd then the FBI investigated and then they came back and said yep all good and now they're tampering so\nI have a list of ... do you want to hear my list of whom ads pharaoh\nBooker Matt Feinstein mad a democratic mad and now they're claiming their the cover up\nI kid you not\nIt just gets better and better they stay there and they cover up you guys\nHow I mean I'm ... how\nHow in the world would that even be possible in any way\nHow would there be a cover up I mean it's only the most known about it and that's just what do they covering up some ... and\nIt doesn't make any sense but that's their talking points that it's a big talking point in fact uh this is to listen to the uh audio soundbite a stricter to somebody Twenty one Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer says this was all this wasn't good enough with them\nWe have many fears said this was a very limited process would constrain the FBI from getting all the fat [noise] having received a thorough revenge on the documents those fears have been realized for what\n\nWhat what fares\nOh now suddenly they ask me I didn't do a good amount of a job that organization whose skills into buildings and the resources to me ... and I asked at the last caller and love our committee sat in late is no longer goldie NASA\nWell what do you want what do you want for real\nI mean what what what are you all waiting for when it gets better because then Dianne Feinstein the woman who sat on his accusation for how many weeks who you know you could have had an investigation that lasts forever but you also you were going to be killed and sit on it and suddenly that doesn't look so cute anymore right\nYou're I Know you guys are yeah it's just not working so here in signed signed discussing that she she blames Trump\nThe White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record I Know that\nAnd insured Ninety percent of his emails and memos were available\nFor the Senate or the public in the hearing it now appears to say also blocked the FBI was doing its job\n... trail blocked\nExcept it's not true it's completely false and not true um in fact there has been a just with with Brett Kavanaugh there have been about nine hundred thousand pages of records\nWhich is more than the last five justices come by the left side seal messes up so when we come back more

who am I the way\nThey know to the Senate Judiciary committee is it a new standard you can just say no\nI don't know you could do that she she wouldn't turn over her note she refused David French and attorney wrote about this my friend over at National Review he said no she she outright said she wouldn't\nDo it and it undercooked any effort she said this is a serious problem and it undercuts any effort to prove our claims against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe American legal system is characterized by mandated transparency\nAnd he goes what my friend and he said he says in criminal cases the prosecution is required to release exculpatory information\nIn other words it can be required to under ... its own case and civil litigation parties are generally required to turn over not just all relevant non privileged documents to the other side there also required to turn over all document that could lead to the discovery of relevant information\nThat's one reason why the decision to litigate should never be taken lightly 'cause you're opening just kind of it's called discoveries with the process is called\nSo [noise]\nBut the Democrats kept saying on purpose well this isn't a trial for the job interview so essentially what they were saying is well we don't have to meet the standards of fairness or balance or anything like that we can just make a baseless accusation and not have to prove it that's what they were saying\nAnd in any other any other court room it would have been in a courtroom it would have been dismissed and it was and it and it should be a bit and should be dismissed here they can bitch and moan all they want to about something being incomplete but you all have nobody to think for yourselves you got an individual who could not corroborate a single one of her claims\nYou got an individual who refused to cooperate and provide information to the Senate Judiciary committee that could have further shed perspective and and and in some sort of and could have further illuminated the scope the breath of her what she says\nCorroborated and was evidence of her claim she refused to corrupt a cooperate her attorneys refused to cooperate Democrats refused to cooperate and now they want to complain about the process and say that it wasn't it that it didn't include everything again\nI Would say that\nThis isn't the same\nSo going forward oh and I wanted to share this to\nA a\nWheeling Kaiser's her family's speaking out there was a big I don't know if it's out there and check that there's a big old piece up\nAbout her\nFor ... that was a where her family smokes a daily mail\nAnd\nShe they say and apparently living Kaiser says Christine for through her under the bus\nYep\nAnd the family says yes she did not corroborate her story to the FBI [noise] a close relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion that Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges she said no health challenges of not impaired her memory but being caught up in the cabinet scandal has been physically trying\nTheir and their ... she just she they say that she just uh it was like she was dragged meant that Ford which called to the principal's office this is what the family members that it felt a lot like Christine was the one called the principal's office to get an account of something and through Leland under the bus you know just reached foreign name\nAnd Howard J Walsh the third Kaiser's attorney a confirmed last night that Kaiser spoke with the FBI and when she did she could not corroborate for the count\nInstead she doubled down on what she already dated to the Senate\nCommittee did you hear anything by the way in the media on MSNBC CNN any of them about the FBI talking to leave and Kaiser\nNo [noise]\nAnd she completely did not corroborate Ford's account\nMhm\nShow she would that be I spoke with her and and remember Ford called her her best friend\n\nShe said she was my best friend at Holton arms and apparently even after she said that they were close and then Kaiser's relatives said that Keyser was shocked that she named her as a witness because she has a new governor in several years she said it was like she just took a name out of the ether\nHuh [noise]\nNow she that she just kind of I think they talk via text really but that was pretty much as she said she hadn't talked to her in several years so the protesters are out in force as well and it looks like because we have two scenarios here and I you know like I said I was on Fox and friends this morning to ask you know what\nWould happen what would happen if they if they didn't confirm Kavanaugh and I hope that the Republican Party does not play this kind of a gamble\nI Will actually like Senator Lindsey Graham suggestion\nThat is that didn't happen\nAnd they didn't uh they weren't able to confirm him I think that he should be re nominated truck should re nominated him\nAnd then you appeal the cynic the verdict to the ballot box and Utah all those people out there you are elected me\nAnd you tell all those people out there you elected me to fulfill my promises that I made an ISIS ill my promises\nThat they are blocking your will in the Senate pulling across America\nShows and I consider and go over it with you\n\nPeople are infuriated over how the Democrats handled this process which I'm going to discuss how it's painting Democrats later on in the show in a number of state and a number of battleground races too [noise]\nAnd it's also increasing a GOP voter enthusiasm which is huge and Trump is say look I kept my promise the Senate's blocking\nYour will how are you going to respond\nEven if Kavanaugh is confirmed you all need to realize you still need to turn out just as you would if he wasn't and he was re nominated again to be confirmed actor midterms\nBecause you see how Democrats are acting right now\nDid did you did you hear about the Democrat who was doc scene Dianne Feinstein staffer who Dr

identity theft and second degree burglary\nHe what's currently working for a number of Democrats but most are but at but really with Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd this I mean unbelievable he posted a lot of
