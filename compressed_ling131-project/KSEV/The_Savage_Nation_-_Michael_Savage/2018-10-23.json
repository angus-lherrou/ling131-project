looking forward to the ... midterm elections coming up in a couple of weeks here the polls in the lead up to the midterm elections\nAre starting to look a lot better for the Republican the reason for that is because Democrats get everything there is a lot of attempt on the right to claim that all Republican no ... Republican are good at thing\nNo what what's really happening here is any Democrat max is off the Democrats are garbage an everything basically when President Trump in the second thing in the new editing during the Republican when he is the first thing in the news it's a problem someone Democrats than weeks\nDemonstrating they don't care about due process and that they will railroaded I simply for political reasons\nHair the Republican when he lead headline in the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for him in the

for Republican the best friend that Republicans right now\nThe intensity of the Democrats and you're seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you can get back to a very good economy on the Republican the margin by which voters trust Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling really say are plus Seventeen and polish amazing also\nI don't want to get no credit president from President Trump has done a couple of very good things number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the president of the United states does it make it feel like he has a change actor\nAnd usually in mid term election there's an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as a party of change well being the party in power and it's really unusual usually the party out of power in the party of change but because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is a guy who's sitting in the\nThat is very good for Republicans but here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal voter interest in the mid term elections has surged to record within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to lead Congress according to a new Wall Street journal and the news poll new findings that point to an energized electorate\nBuffet and by dynamic that brings great uncertainty the outcome of an election just two weeks away\nAnd what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that is the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since a journal and he pulled again asking the question in two thousand six\nNow the reason for that is because largely am Democrat Democrat as we're always going to be energized vote against President Trump but now Republicans are ... are really mobilized and vote against the Democrats I Know that my interest in voting\nPeaked significantly thanks to the Democrats behavior during the cabinet shop guy and I know that most of the Republican\nField but they have the one large gap between Republican voters in democratic voters interest in the election has now been closed sixty eight percent of Republican voters and Seventy two percent of Democrats say they are very interested in the election\nAnd the highest recorded for either party by the survey in a midterm election also President Trump's from job approval rating has jumped to forty seven percent according to the wall Street Journal and\nBikinis Paul had the highest mark he had ever had an office\nIn that poll you know higher than President Obama's average pull approval rating before the two thousand election now it's worth

Trump diminished ration we're just going to disappear the transgender now\nKnow that it's not what they're doing and here's what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by General Kelly at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections and transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because of gender is biological and immutable entities delivered at birth\nNot what the what the Saturday redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about\nReally I mean that because sometimes when people in general what they mean it expressed feminine or masculine quality and sometimes what they mean in actual fact and it was impossible to tell which unless they actually about to buy and then they shifted definition\nBased on what they want their point to be the what is really the one making the case that only two genders they're saying that if you're a feminine and you're actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually I'm at\nOnly two genders they're saying that if they're a feminine men are actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually a man if he wanted to find gender is just expressed characteristics of femininity or doing any there seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means is meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say that gender has to do with biology\nNow you have that ... that is based on y chromosome than X chromosome now they're intersect people and they're very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can you fully genetically male and female\nAll of this make no logical sense it completely confusing because it makes no sense there is no internal consistency or logic and transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their term\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman is a woman Caitlyn Jenner and just as much of a woman at my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone would half a brain on planet earth no\nBut there is what the New York times that series of protection by the Obama administration losing the legal concept of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth\nPersonal sex assigned at birth is the dumbest term in the world the only the gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even that sentence you can see the terminology shifting\nRight there's gender and then there's a sign of her\nYou don't sign attack at birth babies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not find her girl\nYou know was her girl genetic God that was sort of baked in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born you know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow it's a difficult and it turned out he is in fact a boy amazing coincidence they come out and he has all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh hey here's what they say the policy prompted bite of our bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arena or gender was once seen as a simple concept and services especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times concerning especially evangelical Christians were done this is a win slandering religious people they can\nThey not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate category\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that want our main women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's group and the same thing for bathrooms no it must be that there is so crazy people believe in the Jesus\nIt's those people the people if it weren't for those ... leaving the genes then it would then everything would be fine and we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage and blow it here's of the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing to complement attraction that\nNow the department of health and Human Services spearheading an effort to damage the legal definition of tax under title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education program that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues in his memo that the government agencies needed to adopt and it looked at and uniform definition of gender is determined on a biological basis that is clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition would define that 'cause he's a male or female an changeable and determined by the generals or person in Portland according to unwrap review by the time and just being about one fact would have to be clarified in genetic testing\nHow in the world that not just basic rationality and you clean your woman I should be able to get to tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up to it can get to use it aside and it's amazing to me that the same left that has now come around you Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because not ... well she's actually the Native American why isn't she Native Americans you should they why\nNot use more Native American and Caitlin generous woman so what exactly is the problem here\nIt's truly amazing so you wonder why the right doesn't trust and they gave you wonder why people are resonating to the right it's because the less intense than we absolutely ... bottom eyes ourselves on basic contact like ... and the woman and what is a man and we're supposed to pretend to great evil when the

blunder license two to three two one three\n[noise]\nLive around the world\nOn Twitter official Dana last on Facebook [noise]\nWe got some very\nInteresting story trees for quick five today let's kick it wants to do this five [noise] boy\nAll right where to even start of this yeah I'm going to just go ahead and start with us on because it sounds like a nightmare on a flight an unwanted game of foot de force a southwest flight to make an emergency landing\n[noise] food\nIt was from LA to Dallas to make an emergency landing in Albuquerque because an unruly passenger who was repeatedly harassed and a woman seated next to them on a flight\nNow he faces an assault charge up to end up to Twenty years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine for his confrontation with the cabin fruits\nAnd you can spend a year in prison you're going to be prohibited possess or convicted twenty nine year old jail Justin ... was on southwest like eight five nine he sat next on on identified woman right before the takeoff he put his arm on her leg\nAnd when she refused his advances towards that we've tried to play for the with her [noise]\nSo this was when I Would have punched him in his throat and kicked him in his crank and dumped on him until they had to land the plane because I was kicking his but\nAh she tried to make them stop his actions he allegedly pulled on her sweater try to ask her to go out finally flight attendants intervening moved her new a new seat he still didn't stop the harassment when he tried to approach or a guinea got into a confrontation with the cabin crew\nA he said that she was flirting with him I think he was under the influence of drugs but a parent land the criminal record in the history of violence I'm not kidding you I ... world one real quick story sitting on a plane one time and I was in a window seat I hate window seats I like to sit in the aisles because I like to control the that I'll accept\nAnd uh somebody I felt something cold and claiming touch my elbow and I turned around I Swear hands to guy it was some little skinny hipster dudes who had his grocery dirty naked feet on my arm rest and his toe touched my elbow I wasn't I wasn't even going to demonstrate courtesy you turned around and I said if you don't move your feet I'm going to punish them off [noise]\nHe looked at me like I was insane and I said I mean it and he finally moved to the end he didn't touch him again and I had to use another brand new one white cause they wipe everything down break that down to white that part of my arm is down in case my elbow touched it again and the white my elbow off I Will punch your feet right the hell off your ankles if you touch me with them\nEspecially on a plane Michael ... Texas resist almost rally a trauma and having a rally at six thirty today and Texas a and a Michael ... he was going to hold a counter resistance rally but because he's having some tax problems\nLike apparently he was like millions I Will talk about that coming up or they're not gonna yeah that that could he probably was only going to attract tens of people that's why nobody nobody wants to go out of this guy\nOf Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the male really on and Joaquin Castro said that defeating odd things is like a blueprint for defeating global warming\nNot even making this up this is an actual legitimate thing that she had said she says courts that we talk about the central priced and the last time we had a really major at the central throughout the world where she'll\nAnd so we've like bang here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before she legit compared it to not I'm not even kidding you not even getting you know nobody won the mega million saying can you believe that it's going to be two billion dollars\nDidn't raise the two billion now that's not even all of it part of all is that six hundred million I don't\nI don't gamble and I don't I don't play the lottery I made my husband get lottery tickets any complained about it the entire time and said it was a tax on stupidity and I said well I guess it got to pay it sometime\nSo now the Powerball jak part of the six hundred and twenty million the mega millions in its right now well the last measurement was at one point six billion they say it's going to be up to about two million\nOr two billion I'm Sorry two billion with a beat\nFor you to get your tickets are going to work [laughter]\nWe have a lot more coming up including the latest with the caravan\n\nThe midterms are just a couple of

many many many many many men\nI saw more men and women and children [noise]\nCame to look food there is ten thousand what sort of only five\nBut not one hundred percent of those people are good people there and there is a fraction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally he's actually harmful to their own life well yeah\nI mean and that contributes to the human trafficking it's it's I mean because you're going to what is it but some of the border patrol agents told me that they would carry a plan B\nFor some of these yet little girls that become a little girls that would come across I heard some horror stories and I'm not even going to repeat here on air um for some of the border uh agents and some of the chiefs down there who am I have spoken to face to face whenever I've been down near the border and I\nMean it's amazing to think that the stuff happens in twenty Eighteen it is amazing to think of this happened\nTo me ... is the fact that the media would rather pay those says Trump being evil and not accepting these caravans or whatnot as opposed to what really goes on to be thinking about\nIf these people because they said that they wanted they they were trying to say that they want it in the end then Mexico said well you're going to have to fill out the paperwork and go through all of that well they didn't want to wait for the processing time\nDo you think that the processing time that they if they make it to the U.S border is going to be any easier or any\nFaster than what they saw when they were at the border between Guatemala and Mexico hardly I hardly doubt it\nNow the president has said look through the national emergency here are they are the Caribbean has grown inside the president says it as a national emergency and he days the meanwhile they've they ... they have successfully crossed into Mexico they regrouped\nAh\nThe Mexican now the federal aid Sarah failed to turn any of them back basically\nAnd\nThat he said he's ready to send troops to the border because it's a national emergency emergency and that is that the you know honestly each also how or does everyone even have proper documentation et cetera et cetera et cetera\n\nHeaded I've read in some instances it the caravan as either a mile or two miles long and for the most part they print been pretty unimpeded I mean I'm Sorry I looked when they were going across the border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nBut it it didn't look at I mean they just pass through the gates was just not\nIt didn't look it didn't look I Need it didn't look that they just look like they walk or ride on through ... and that was pretty much yet\nSo that's that's a that's problematic and if these individuals' aren't aren't ... if they don't want to wait for\n\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that they're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nKane says that they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day it could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid\nTerm but who knows what's gonna happen who knows what's going to happen at this point but there's\nAn edge to march up to the border and demand entry that's not going to work and if it if it ends up being five to seven thousand are they going to try to break through like what we saw because I've heard some people say that looks like an invasion and you know what they're right\nAgain you could have stopped in ... in the in Mexico\nBut they didn't want to wait for that they just want it immediately go in and then they didn't want to say they're they're just going to go to the United states is it about him is do you have to ask that question legitimately isn't really about amnesty because you don't have to go all the way the United states\nSo\nHad apparently some in the caravan includes a number of deportees deportees who have some experience with all of it\nUm\nBecause apparently now there's a second caravan that are formed in Honduras and they've already across in Guatemala and they're going to catch up to the main group that is now in Mexico\nA\nTraveling with him as a main enemy in the ... as a twenty nine year old who was deported six times his lifetime just five months ago and so he's with marching and he's apparently advising people\nBut\nHow do you mean that's the thing what they're what people are going to want to do is they're going to want to have a stand off at the border and I think that they would time it to be I I don't know after a while it's going to happen after midterms by the time they end up getting there\nBut I Do think that there are Democrats that won the optic of\nHaving that stand off at the border because can you go over\nObject of having that stand\nOff at the border because can you go overboard can you overplay their hand\nThey're gonna they're gonna be some people who are going to I mean if you put a military response on the border to prevent this sort of storming of the gates is what we saw from Guatemala and Mexico you're going to have that op they're going to tell you what you're going to have Democrats are going to be campaigning on that forever but that doesn't mean Republican should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand and trained to someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what they are the legal process and you disrespect the country and you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith enter the country and be a part of this you know the citizenry family that's what it showcases and its sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person and\nThey don't have to let anyone and it's a sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nAnd it did did did it this is being used as political capitals what it is\nAnd I don't see any Democrats trying to dissuade any of these individuals from undertaking it's very dangerous twelve hundred plus mile journey to the southern border going through cartel country\nWhere people go missing constantly and no one ever stopped to search for them because it's just too dangerous for cops or even killed there was one story about a border town well it was close to a border town that was in cartel country where the sheriff was murdered than a female took over because she was done with the crime and she became share of all that killed her tail they don't care\n\nAnd that's it all for what Democrats want that often they want the optic of a Republican president and then they're going to make they're going to make comparison to a um the civil rights when uh who would that do Bull Connor they're going to make comparisons to bulk up they're going to do all of that stuff\nI guarantee you that is what they're going to do that is what the plan is\nYou're going to have him go down there for a photo ops all of that stuff\nIs going to be a huge thing and they're going to try to make those individuals who think that everyone should enter legally because of the country has the right to know who is entering to make sure that you don't have that characters entering they're going to make those individuals look awful started that's what the goal is going to be an immediate going to work overtime to help them\nAnd how bad this it depends on what happened during midterms\n\nIt all depends on what happens with midterms\nComing out there's more NFL anthem drama there was a player pre games scuffle over kneeling and I just thought this was so bizarre that story also Cory Booker has been accused of sexually assaulting\nA man

understand where you're coming from there and grab the all the ...\nAbout that which is on MSNBC what are the which is I never saw him is he going to do with it for the anti American anti family anti got anti Christian women on MSNBC what are they going to do with it or that felt good boy I felt good saying that I'm seven years what are all the witches on MSNBC the anti American\nAnti family anti God which is on MSNBC men and women what are they going to do with this with with such a fence I don't know I'm going to send you a copy of stop mass hysteria maybe you can convert one person to reality in New York if you're calling from New York I don't even know\n[noise] well I'm open for business here I promised other stuff we're only talking about the character what if you won the Powerball mega million sixty one point six billion dollars how much would you actually pay\nWell mostly we don't know that we'll make more than a certain amount paid thirty seven percent of our income to the fads and then if we live in New York\nOr California we pay a ... a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent in the state on top of federal tax which used to be the doctor for federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes in California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality\nSo that's the top income tax rate for individuals there's thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in after all the gangs have to take their cut to\nYou know the gangs that are run the states need to take their cut how else can they buy their new brownies suits and they're five hundred dollar ties how can you buy a really sort of less you're taking the money from the the ... or in the living so how we got to stop\nThe map these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you like you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals and the ... when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like be a little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's disarming of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a martyr Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so less both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly control of all I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you're in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets\nBut I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now\nWhich is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but let's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where you're the whole story that you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small somebody and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west well as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was lifted a very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Mara like wow does that sound like does the gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating my early and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd guess what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and down you enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary won the vandals in what was once that Syria and is now Romania\n... Scott's behind those in South Russia when the east God's or awestruck gosh and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lambs and then with the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nAnd I will tell you assume what happened and how the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west\nJoy love Savage mentioning coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to some\nJust Savage Nation and sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nIf you suffer from E.

Constantine originally beat back a raid of the guts the gods you know about ... you know what I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco [noise] he'd beat Baca right of the guys\nWho are trying to come in from the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind them to protect the frontier across the Daniel why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a weaken empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into without summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch because what happened was\nCautioned team did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome were ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at address in our poll they building settlements in Bulgaria and from eighty seven three seven nine to three Ninety five that came the emperor you do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable and ... and ...\nAnd over the armies of Italy and only a presided ... he wasn't Mandel\nAnd he presided over the armies and the Balkan Peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to bore you are histories to blow me as a kid but the more I study these things I realized that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable on our borders\nWere being pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after ... marched into Italy and after a short sheets took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after on collapsed didn't life go on for the average Roman listen carefully\nThe opening half of the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire in Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that sound like gangs listen to what I just sent this and that area is outrageous in history\nAs a Roman emperor empire and Europe collapses in the fifth century robber armies are barbarians what preying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that\nThinking about what you're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock our cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around a suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realize it at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break and\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds rather hysterical but ... is rather accurate\nIt sells rather hysterical but it is ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and looked at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the fake news business\nSo\nI can tell you what went on in the life in the countryside half the room was invaded\nAnd what happens to the nation their roads and forests became infested with robbers\nThe barbarians went into the forest so stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians over in raising marijuana in the ... national forest these presenting beautiful ancient far have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't digital criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me as all these green left us who care so much about the environment have said nothing\nAs are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers that are very national forest not one word from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the mantle spends all the time conniving to hate Trump conniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plans and the waste is going into the stream and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAnd as I Try to alarm America yes I Would use the word ringing the alarm bell and
