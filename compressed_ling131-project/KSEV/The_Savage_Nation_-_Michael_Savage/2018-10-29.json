radical politics with the electorate religious affiliation\nWhat you're doing it smearing the religion itself and making the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins and I want to go into that today certainly not in this in this moment\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not speak to the French full development developmentally disabled brothers or this or the seventies and eighties nineties this was a cowardly act it was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know\nThat of all

secret war on cash there's documents real life events such as banks refusing to cash checks cash Korean confiscated from innocence citizens and much much more\nAnd the Israelis though I'm right many many people have his own I'm right with the church is an American many churches and are protected by armed guards but to what progress of the idea of using a policeman an off duty policeman or armed guard is such\nIt's been an off duty policeman or armed guard is such anathema\nThey would rather see people defenseless them protected because they don't want to be seen as politically on the side of those of us who understand the power of protection of guns for the show none other than the lunatic of lunatics to blast ... in New York\nHas the nerve\nTo say no guns in need to listen to clip six so you'll hear the mind them a madman\nYou only man ever allow the normalization of hey\nThat's not what we will stand for\nAnd in that vein we have to say what was said yesterday although so unacceptable no houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able\nTo practice their religion that's not America\nYou know you are really stupid I'm coming to understand that there's actually no logical reason in the mind of a liberal waters normalization of hate have to do with protecting yourself in a synagogue or a church there's no connection between the two\nAnd I would say again there's only one solution to this protect yourself at all times because no one else will be that protects you\nKnow we can Spanish forward because I'm not ready to move up there yet I got too many hours to go you have to move up to it but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled on on defense was Jews who had no way to defend themselves it was the the police with guns Mr ... who went in and stop them it wasn't you with your foul mouth it was cops with guns some of whom got shot shame on you to blast geo shame on you\nFor the Beijing the police for doing this incredible job\nThey were the ones who tracked into a little room where he was hiding and they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic Detroit was weapons now he's in a hospital somewhere being cared for don't you just love that\nLike the terrorists we seen the American after they kill people they're treated better than the people they shot what a wonderful country we live in\nBut nevertheless I'm just a talk show host you're observing\nAnd trying to help you get through this day I Know many of you were waiting for my opinion I understand that I have a very loyal audience\nWho appreciates my view of things and so far I've given you several views of these things in one way or another but I'm not yet gotten to inside the mind of a psychopath\nI've also challenged you by saying do you believe that I'm correct that we need armed guards in houses of worship I mean it's just such an obvious answer to the question what is it wise you're talking about what do you mean who's normalizing hey\nWas saying protect the people\nPut a policeman image and that will be do with schools now remember what happened in Florida with that cowardly cop who hid behind those pillars remember him he was actually in the school to protect the children when that guy came in with the gun where was he hiding behind the pills he's still like they got pension now\nThe cops should be in prison who ran away these cop should be invited to the White House which they will be\nOne of them are still in the hospital because he took a bullet wounds in the hands thank God none of them were killed but some of them was severely injured because unlike the blast yeah they knew they knew that one thing gun save lives guns save lives guns save lives\nIt's a great group called juice for the protection of firearms ownership they know all about this\nAnd so I Want to play for you to sound at this moment of the scanner audio at the end of this is the one at the
