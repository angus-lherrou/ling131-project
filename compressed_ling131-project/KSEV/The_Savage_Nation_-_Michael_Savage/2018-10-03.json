all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at it bringing up subjects we wouldn't know about it over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back

person in very bad situation okay\nI see that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know [noise] ah I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however whatever the senators want is okay with me\nAll right we'll get right back to that but first this radio show is just one technical and a great way to the drawing the bench pure world\nYou want to hear more it

drinking let's talk about the Senate drinking in the Senate and the stories about the drinking in the Senate or in credible\nAnd you know he's pulling the rug out from under them because in the whole thing and holding was not about drinking it wasn't about temperament\nIt was about being seen\nTry to raise a girl\nWhen he was Seventeen years old that was what it's about this all ... they're just trying to move the goalposts that's what it's about and he's calling Melanie and he just and I my my favorite remark in this whole press conference when he starts talking about about drinking and the fact that she doesn't drink and this was a ... number eleven\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good trade for [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I just you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess I'd be what I did what'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that here and\nWatch them and saying that he did have difficulty as a young man was drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty list\nWhere did you think the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years because nobody said anything bad about him\nHow confident they have I mean an actually Trump this is the thing Trump is talking since\nThey're talking about whether he drank and college they're talking about whether he drank in high school how about the last Twenty years oh what's his life when like I mean how confident they have to be is president the say the fact that I don't drink is my only good trait and can you imagine what a monster I Would be if you you know just how he just is feeling like onions filling issues\n... I'm Sorry what people don't notice there's because a lot of people don't like Trump and they don't notice the way he changes in the way he adapts have always said very adaptable guy he's got to learn on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has with him\nBut that is incredibly missions like the precedent absolute hysteria mowed the left\nAbsolute hysteria mode Jeff Flake this email that in an elevator he collapses\nTrump is like a rock I mean I I'm I'm Serious it's just not normal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always in their fighting them not saying that but he's got a which just confident\nAnd cool about the whole thing does not seem like she has anything at risk and when they ask them for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want they have to be I think is nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when it's a blessing in disguise because it's called the mouth that's why they have to change their tune but when they ask for more time he has this great was small just cut ten [noise]\nTell me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a really thorough investigation when all the time in the world she didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed potentially\nShe said listen I have a problem\nThis reporter I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing areas we had to launch no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably did they should have very bad body language other day but\nMore importantly in the sense for her to wait in that period of time and now for you Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm including you do the media writes I consider you thought of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time for the FBI if he wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bringing us up\nThat that is amazing it's just amazing stuff because you could see the reporters asking the question I didn't know who was with the way the reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats looked like she kind of when it's going to rip up liking it struck are almost\nThe guy is in control in this press conference partly I'm sure it's because of the victory of NAFTA which really does rain a lot of what a lot of the ... really answer is a lot of the attacks on him\nBut partly it has got to be because he feels he has got this thing ... and I just listen part of why I think\nThis Kavanaugh thing is collapsing and they are not going to sell even people on the left\nOr who are undecided they're not going to sell you yeah we send me a rape somebody is not rape but he was drinking in what they were there some guy but he didn't stand near the punch bowl he was that you know he was standing with I didn't get into Heathrow some ice and the guy in college not going to watch I just don't think so and I think that\nYou know I I take this from the fact\nThat the left is moving the goalpost the left is not changing the subject basically because once the FBI thing started it was kind of like a yeah I think we got nothing so they're changing to temperament and didn't drink in college and then you throw it and it's been two eyes and all this stuff\nAnd the fact that Trump has just remain a chill I mean she'll Trump is not what I'm used to I think the case against Kavanaugh is falling absolutely the pieces are and we'll be right back to talk about how\nAs we\nCan tell you were serving time they're boys am somewhat debris ball used it\nFor each of those [noise]\nThose as our friend saw hauled off all\nFar President Trump's campaign rally Mississippi Republican candidate says some of the\nAllegation against friend Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are quote just crazy what's\nHappening now\nThey have [noise]\n\nMany different charges [noise] jumped and it fits very dangerous drunk on\nThe structure of launches into its get like monologue about a man who's told his mother he got the job does dreams after saying the attack on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's dangerous for all mountain mom [noise]\nA terrible thing which is just as a person who was never meant that I did things\nThat was horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nMama why why do I do mom\nLawyers for two women who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual misconduct say they fear the up the ... not conducting a thorough investigation as Republican leaders territorial decides to vote on the nomination this week\n...

apparently ... he hasn't been able to find her yet who after being raped by the guard Mars gave birth to the founders of Rome name Rami let's end Remus did you know that well the rest is history\nAnd I'd give this to you to show you that what we're going through right now\nWhile not related to ancient Rome is related to history in many ways what Campbell Harris Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nShy name all of them and the others on the committee are doing today is actually nothing new under the sun\nIt went on in the Soviet Union were all you have to do was denounced someone and their life was ruined it went on in Hitler's Germany or you had to do was renounced someone in their life was ruined then they were imprisoned if not executed so the new left are actually the new right\nThe new left or the new fascist as many have said but what we are witnessing and the average person certainly see through it\nIs unfounded accusations are not American at all in fact they're very on American which leads me to the house of on American activities committee of the Nineteen fifties\nHow many years where you left us lecture to about a set of their McCarthy being a very bad man because she accused in some cases falsely\nPeople in America are mainly in the government the media and an academic year of being communist or communist sympathizers right and we're told that was a false thing if it gets it ruin lives and McCarthy was set to be a bad man now let's put aside the fact that\nMost of the people that McCarthy outages communist turned out to be communists as we learn in the Nineteen eighties when the owner papers were released you'll have to research that even own a papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy Warren fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside\nHow many times have you been lectured by leftist professors that McCarthy was a bad man\nThat McCarthyism which became synonymous with false accusations was an evil thing we wake up and we see the Feinstein is now McCarthy\nOnly gets no troops were allegations we see that every one of them on the committee or the new Soviet ... and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people will shine through all of this mark\nAnd that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved however I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is\nAnd you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but I think that flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says not remembered this before we go on\nKavanaugh had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge Morocco Obama have none\nIn fact I said it when Obama became president he could not pass to the FBI background check it'd be an been an even ordinary FBI agent Obama could not have become an ordinary FBI\nAgent because of his associations with very dangerous leftist including ... layers that others but he never\nFly size of half a background check I really wonder why we don't have the audacity of all of the new so\nThis is Michael Savage on stuff mass hysteria [noise]\nHave you ever taken your car and for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and bingo surprise you hit with a huge repair bill\nAnd what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's what that's why I recommend the extent of the vehicle protection from car she'll if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles car she can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands\n... on your protected by car shield you can

by the ultimate an extended vehicle production get car shield how call eight hundred car sixty one hundred eight armored car sixty one hundred\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media what have you believe it is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I gave you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction\nIn this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven is proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they had been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years and that is why I tell you history as a great great teacher were going through a form of mass and easier which is not a myth\nMass amnesia is not a myth\nIs a conspiracy of sorts a vaguely defined plan to undermine the nation mass from the Asia it's perpetrators noted a malleable populist as a necessary tool to achieve an agenda\nAs bird the scent Bernie Sanders discovered when his pie and this guy promises during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises of free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another tack\nYou have to do there which tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine and what I'm Talking about today is marijuana remember for many many years of marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana but today the exact opposite is being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from Boulder salads houses cancer falling arches arthritis ... and runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it's insanity\nA form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug the youth in order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left\nSo we're living through the new Soviet era in America being promulgated by the Feinstein committee I call it that because she is the senior she keeps saying she's the senior member of the committee\nWill she knows the libel and slander law is in America she knows that there's a difference between libel and slander she knows a defamation can destroy a person forever and yet they're engaging in a form of defamation I have not seen in my entire lifetime in America as an American citizen\nAnd more particularly in the twenty five years I've been in the radio business and there's an author I have never seen such an unmitigated a defamation as I'm seeing against Kavanaugh right now\nNow I spent a little time talking about the Salem witch trials for my forthcoming book stop mass hysteria which will be out across America opening big opening wide think of it as a movie that's opening in every theater in America that's the one thing you gotta understand although you won't sing on Fox News\nFor the reasons I expressed many times it doesn't mean that the films that opening wide it's opening wide\nWalmart and Sam's that will be a best seller tables books that million making those table Barnes and noble every Barnes and noble in America will have it on a new release table from the ninth of October through the twenty seconds of October and will be on the holiday table from the thirtieth of October through the twelfth of November\nThat's a big deal\nOf course on Amazon and say sponsored placement of headliner and suggests the purchase\nSo the publishers doing an amazing job in getting around the boycott of Michael Savage by paying for placement that every book store in America with the exception of the small communist bookstores throughout America where they use a form of censorship or that they're entitled to do to their own detriment\nNow what we're about to do on the show is very risky and very dangerous and I want to caution everyone calling\nThat there are libel and slander law is in America that can get me in hot water and get you and hot water but having set up that comedy I I'm asking anyone in America who lives in the district of these new Soviet ...\nOr who have been falsely accusing habit or with the most astonishing claims I've ever seen in my lifetime first it was remember the rape charges brought up by the psychopath at NBC aired last night by\nThe SCA lawyer remember that and then she said she didn't really mean it if you live in a district of any of these senators who are quick to destroy a man and you have something that you feel as a valid piece of their background that is not getting proper attention\nI'm inviting you to air it on the Savage Nation with accommodate again I'd like you to confirm way you're getting the information from [noise]\nAnd there have been cases of mass hysteria in our own time or that have destroyed people that almost destroyed companies I'll give you one example of a corporate example the contaminated Coca Cola scare of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd that began in Ninety nine when more than a hundred students in Belgium reportedly fell ill after drinking the beverage\nWell the subsequent investigation coupled with some inept PR handling costs Coca Cola a cool two hundred million dollars and several they ban and other European countries\nAnd while examination of the tainted batches did show contamination of bad carbon dioxide and female\nTo Belgian scientists speculated that the tainted products yielded to smaller amount to cause real damage and for them the incident was mostly a case of mass hysteria field in part prior prior scare mad cow disease and dioxins tainted animal products\nA separate investigation by Belgium as high hygiene council in March of two thousand corroborated those claims and say that most of the victims experience they mass psycho Jenike illness just as we're experiencing today in America a form of mass hysteria\nWith these trials of Kavanaugh okay there are many cases of mass hysteria in our past\nBut they've never in my lifetime been primarily get hit by a panel of left wing fanatical Soviet era US Senator\nOkay we'll be back in a few minutes on a Savage Nation\nJoy love Savage Nation

Arabic one was a Turkish drama I became hooked on in Turkish\nAnd now I'm watching one I'll high but I think and it's set in Lebanon and the border of Lebanon and Syria with the mafia family that's been there for hundreds of years that control an entire district and the you know they run the the drugs they run the guns through the district and what I came to understand something\nUh watching these Arabic dramas first of all I Love the language I Love to watch it I like to see the subtitles\nThe none of these films have any sexuality in them and yet they're captivating none of the films what TV shows made in Muslim countries show any sex and yet they're captivating\nThe women are stunningly beautiful\nThe men are very robust Shirley handsome and and testosterone driven filled with rage the way most real men are and yet there is no sex shown there's just a subtle sexuality and all of it through the appearance of the people but again no overt sexuality\nSuch as a side note of watching this drama of this a\nLebanese mafia family in the hills of or Lebanon on the border with Syria that I got was almost all of the American mafia movies the ... the over the overly costly nature of the way the gangster speaking in American Gangster movies are used to up until recently\nA is all directly related to the structure of these Arabic a family's incidentally in other words when you see the Sicilian\nMafia type speaking in a courtroom matter which we came to think is highly theatrical\nAnd that is derived from the structure of the language and of the families a that was laid down by the Arabic innovators of Sicily is a long time ago I'm trying to explain something to you\nThat even watching TV drama you could put the pieces together and see the connections that doesn't have anything to do with the cabin or hearing I'm just giving you an observation the only observation as any relevance to this time today and what I Am disgusted and in watching this drama in Arabic\nIs again there is no section it there's no filter that there's no dirty language or that there's no apps nothing no rubbing up the body parts no no no uh no jewels in the teeth none none of that none of the filth in garbage of the American media today is in it\nAnd yet as captivating to watch\nNow we switch phones to America last night hits a new low in the new ... America\nAnd a man on television who I think it's basically talent lists and psychotic I Would say that Jimmy Kimmel by my estimation as a mentally ill person seriously mentally ill\nFor him to take out a trade with mushrooms on it and ask a degenerate filthy poll dancing over the hill horse face loser which one most approximate the president's private parts\nAnd that network let this run network didn't censor it network didn't cancel his show and wait it gets even worse the sponsors didn't cancel the show\nThe same sponsors that will not broadcast will not advertise on TALK radio\nI don't
