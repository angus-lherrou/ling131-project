you've got to today we're going to get you some very weird stories about Kanye West in an attempt to thing Robert Mueller with a fake sexual assault accusations to all of that we begin today with the less continued narrative that right wing rhetoric is driving murder across the United states\nThere's a lot of talk this week about radicalization and polarization and the idea is that right wing radicalization being led by the right wing rhetoric at Fox News and\nAnd the right wing rhetoric from President Trump expressing their viewpoints today is Paul Krugman who is legitimately one of the worst columnist in America yet heavy competition over on the New York times editorial page but it's also like Charles Blow but Karlan is truly inexorable comments I usually reserve that word only for Michael Moore\nBut it certainly applied to Paul Krugman as well proven has a column today called the hate is on the ballot next week\nAnd here is what you said that in America ... what about them as last refuge scoundrels and both sides is in his lap refuge of cowards so he suggesting here for ... you don't know what these words mean\nWhat about them is a kind of new fangled word for you don't want to pay attention to the your own side doing do you blame the other side\nSo if you're talking about President Trump's sexual infidelity\nIs that in doing do you blame the other side so if you're talking about President Trump sexual infidelity\nAnd he'd say oh yeah well what about Bill Clinton sexual infidelity\nThat would be what about them like you'd think and what about admit now taking place on the basis of rhetoric does if you hadn't noticed we're in the midst of a wave of hate crimes just from the past few days bombs were mailed to a number of prominent Democrats\nCNN then a gunman massacred eleven people at Pittsburgh synagogue meanwhile another gunmen killed two African Americans in Louisville supermarket after first trying to unsuccessfully break into a black church if he'd gotten there an hour earlier we probably would have had another mass murder\nOnly hate crime he clearly linked the climate of paranoia and racism deliberately fostered by President Trump and his allies in Congress and the media killing black people in an old American tradition experiencing a revival in the Trump era cats at it purely despicable\nThe idea that killing black people in old American tradition but didn't experience in our Bible I assume when he means by that is it slavery and Jim Crow were old American tradition and that Trump is reviving a which of course is a complete why he ... he continues because when the bombs or discovered\nMany on the right immediately claimed or fake news or false flag operation by liberal\nBut the Afghan quickly tracked down the apparent

them interested at the ... been right has been critical of Trump who he apparently believed in anti Semitic enough but his rage seems to have been fueled by conspiracy theory\nBeing systematically spreading by Trump supporters the claimed the Jewish finance yours are bringing round people into America to display white so here when he gets appointed how Trump from college in dealing with its ugly picture partly through denial pretending not any link between hateful rhetoric and hate crimes\nBut also through attempt to spread the blame by claiming the Democrats are just as bad if not worse Trump supporters trying to kill us critics well some some owners have yelled at politicians in restaurants\nNow I Know you're putting their you're yelling at your polling you're yelling at your heart

I'm amused amused by Democrats and again and helps you suggest butter publications are engaged in conspiratorial thinking we never engage conspiratorial thinking\nReally I've been alive for the past ... years\nI'm old enough to remember when you suggested that haliburton was behind the Iraq War when he suggested that George W. Bush lied specifically get American Soldiers killed because Iraq was a war for oil I'm old enough to remember when you suggested without any evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump actively coordinated with the Russian government to skew the results of this election\nBad rhetoric has been a part of American politics for very long time and has ratcheted up in recent years who did not start with President Trump pension from the ... he's President Trump has never lower the temperature on anything and his wife\nHave ramped up to eleven I've been saying for years President Trump did a lot of the media are at eleven and then they're surprised when the temperature is over heated\nYou play people they get angry they got radicalized and you know I've never seen Republican conservative and angry and I taught them about a month ago during the break cabinet saga that was a result the Democrat engaging in extreme partisanship an extreme rhetoric\nFailing to recognize what exactly is happening here yet calling it what about them when you suggest correctly that bad things are happening on all sides and that everybody kind of acting like garbage right now that it's contributing to the environment that is making things significantly worse and I don't feel like now that\nBut I think there's some some like you don't care because they're do ensconced in their part in world view that to even acknowledge that folks on their own side are engaged in bad behavior would be to lend credence to the other side and when it comes to eating from\nEverything is on a cable up to and including line about the other side analog Horton lying about your own side and the market with the person is the capacity to look at yourself recognize where your flawed and try to become better all the people in your life you know and like when you make a critique of them\nTheir first reaction and your first reaction to their first reaction at okay maybe I should think about that\nMaybe I should think about that right when I when I'm credits I my first reaction generally it maybe I didn't do something wrong and sometimes I didn't do something wrong and I have to change but nobody seems to want to do any sort of self reflection because we're in the middle of bashing each other across the golden bridge as hard as we can and\nThen suggesting that we are innocent and wreck fight that's not the way that any of this war so coming on President Trump traveled to Pittsburgh and the media coverage in a week\nShow it is true as I say the media covered the story from beginning to end\nIt is also true that when you go and visit\nThe site of a mask anti Semitic shooting worse in American history these key central part of the story is not how you were treated that's not really the important part of the story it's not\nAnd it looks like grand campaign that Mr President please don't do the uh I I always say please don't they just he's not going to let them but this of course is not is not helping in any serious way okay well meanwhile\nThere are a couple of other stories that that we might comment down here and so as I said long ago live by the ... job at a tiny tiny what became belong to the right\nFor the last six seven months after he started making noises about how he loves President Trump and he was wearing a mask I hadn't even saying that he was thinking freely all of which is totally fine but if they treated as soon as he started doing that\nLive by the kind of a guy by the county plenty of what is not a table figure is not somebody who decided to become a an ideological conservative after reading the combine work of William Buckley in wrestled Kirk\nTiny what is the guy who sort of says whatever is on his mind that day well that resulted in a reverse something on Twitter yesterday is not rejected President Trump or ripped into President Trump\nBut it started tweeting out about sort of his political leanings now that I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our world safer and then he continued you said\nI support those written federal I serve and protect us and its support holding people who used their power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents are fighting to protect their children from violence and more Calvin sounds like some speech and then he gets to the point\nHe finally he finally to reach out I introduce each candidate to oh and you can do in the black conservative\nWho was associated with with Conyers moved to the right I introduce candidate for the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she use mine I never wanted any association with blessed that I have nothing to do with it some blacks it is a movement that ... that Canada has been pushing and Charlie ... has been pushing to get black folks to leave the Democratic party\nAnd in announcing black that candidate suggested that the logo for blocks that were designed by Tanya what he obviously does not feel that way and he's upset about it and he pointed out my eyes are now wide open and now realize had been used to spread messages I don't believe in ... and distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative\nSo ouch and also out [noise] so\nThat's not good but when you bet on people who are not the most stable people in the world and you pretend that they are deeply table\nThis is a not unpredictable consequences I think it's fair to say that it's not the least predictable consequences that are happening in human history fortunately that was not need the story of the day the story of the day came courtesy of a guy named Jacob wall claiming sort of you in just a second because it is too wild and ridiculous\nFor me to forego under of all day will come out and just a second but first let's talk about the fact that at some point here we are all going to plot dates up to that reality because it's uncomfortable and therefore you haven't gotten a life insurance\nYou're being a responsible you need like insurance everybody needs life insurance having life insurance is actually a good feeling it's nice to know anything were to happen to make\nMy family wouldn't have started off on me well if you are interested in getting like insurance the best place to do it as a policy genius or the easy way to get life insurance on line and just to me that you can compare quotes from the top insurers and find the best policy for you and when you compare court you save money it is an IED that temple policy genius this health over four million people shop for insurance\nPlace or twenty million dollars in coverage as well\nAnd they don't just make life insurance who the hell to compare disability insurance in auto insurance and home insurance and you care about it they can cover itself if you've been avoiding getting life insurance because it's weird or confusing\nGet power teaching it to try to just go to a policy junior dot com get those quote applying minutes it's their sons one thing to do he can do the whole thing on your opponent right now and you should policy genius is the easy way to compare and by life insurance again go to ... dot com the best way to compare and by life insurance\nSo how Craig Barron politics or county went through the second grade you a story of the day\nThe first grade your story of the day yesterday was crazy story about folks who are trying to think Robert Mueller they're very upset with Robert Mueller and they believe that Robert Mueller is somehow\n... deeply compromise compromise well he compromise because you're not getting Trump and therefore there was a scheme to find women and pay them to lie about being sexually assaulted by Robert Mueller\nI kid you not according to the daily beat the skin became public on Tuesday\nWhen Robert Mueller staff only ask the FBI launched an investigation it's a matter for weeks and it's been simmering below the surface with numerous reporters haven't been tipped off by a woman who claims you could approach with promises of cash at the center of the team is publicity hungry Republican lobbyist Jack Bergman who's repeatedly dabbled in Internet conspiracy theories in the past\nIncluding promoting the idea that murder DNC staffer south rich was killed by the state government operatives Berkman denied involvement in any attempts to pay people to frame or accused Muller but he also claimed his witness case we're going to close the special counsel\nAs a sexual harasser you scheduled for Thursday press conference a Holiday Inn in northern Virginia to introduce his first accuser\nNumber one if you ever are are attempting to\nLaunch incredible fashion some sort of accusation you should upgrade from the holiday in just a recommendation like here we are in the parking lot of motel six\nThe lights on for you and good luck with it that's not the part that it's a Berkman says we're going to prove that Robert mode and he drunk and sexual abuse or yeah sure you are but that's not the part that the best part is that Berkman apparently\nBut that's not the partner that the best part is that Berkman apparently hired I hired a in intel agency in\nIntel agency that was that was supposed to investigate\nRobert Mueller and his effort to dig up dirt on the other Berkman appears to look at outside help Jacob wall is that right wing put her personality who tweeted inane things for years about\nMad mad that President Trump you just don't ascribe printed burp and he said Berkman had told them you've hired Matthew Cohen who claims to be managing partner at the private investigation company surefire intelligence so just with the investigation\nOnly one problem who is Matthew calling who is Matthew calling\nMatthew calling as it turned out is Jacob all okay and Jacob well apparently set up a bunch of fake linked in account for people who work for surefire intelligent by grabbing all the just random pictures from the Internet and using them as employee pictures where you take business\nSo for example he and he said that the un investigators named Donald free horn okay they stopped photograph of an actor and he just used that\nAnd then when I was in the ... and then the television station chief he called the ... only one problem picture of ... ... the Israeli supermodel\nSo he he\nHe went through all the trouble I get that ... that you went through all the trouble to ... to make the to hide what you've been doing from the government and then he went and got pictures of actors and use them at his take employees in financial investigator surefire intelligent it's supposedly a guy named Simon ... who Simon print and take a picture of Christoph Waltz\nIt's a pretty solid higher there [laughter]\nIt's like I got back from a glorious after the financial investigator insured by our intelligence pretty ...
