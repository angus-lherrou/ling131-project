Clinton is trying to come up with a way to combat the what did you come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates of federal power of the modern era she has now discovering federalism I got amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along suddenly Hillary Clinton and the lessons covering it tastes are kind of great\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday in reality image Supreme Court with the right wing majority in the states are new important front in protecting them All right it's actually the right to the most vulnerable\nIs that really a new important front in protecting civil rights\nOr the turnout at the state we're always an important front in protecting tell right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that states we're responsible for that is true it was also said to responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act in an Eighteen fifty leading to the gym or the federal government was trying to force faith in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act\nTaking the north refusing to abide by the fugitive slave act states are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people comprised them but one thing that it's certainly true in the United states at the next\nState and and national ... as it is putting federal thirty nine and they ... some state governments are designed\nTo preserve the sensuality of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that the left is only now realizing it's as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like is the head of the federal government demonstrates just have this on if they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever gotten charge again how long do you think they said by the state's rights proposal\nHow long do you think that in ... states right answers five seconds five seconds\nAt the last ... dishonest about all the stuff that they left that proclaims that Donald Trump is on it it just on it for Hillary Clinton session like eighth right\nNow what Hillary Clinton mean and said she wants to use any optical to prevent President Trump governing here that you believe in steak rice and she actually believe in a case right and presumably should want to demolition of author warning to the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president\nWe all know that that was never going to happen is that we're going to happen in that the truth and what time across really want it to copy the policies of Scandinavian country where people forget to tell you that the policy in Scandinavian country is not just the math and social welfare state the math and social welfare state paid for by enormous\nUnbelievably high taxes\nThe taxes and played like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent that everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year\nWe're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take the paper all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do is they will just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federal when they're not obviously proposing fattening legislation the left is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primary from the Democrat who can spend the most cash so they have come out like Harris is proposing getting every poor family five hundred bucks\nBased on nothing when we really don't know where exactly this money is going to come from how would you like to spur the economy any of that saw Cory Booker says well why didn't five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred let's get everybody Fifteen grand\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way my five million helicopter pallets of cash over newer will just drop out of cash will hopefully people get out of the way now he'll be crushed by money and die happy\nThat apparently the idea of recording talker so according to vox which is neat repository of all things stupid and saying that everybody at boxers do but there are some intelligent poke debacle of why they remain there is beyond the senator Cory Booker and didn't have anything a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor and they hit the lower income kids a sizable nest egg\nNearly Fifteen grand in some cases and they couldn't use for wealth building permanent there's like a down payment on a house or college tuition these opportunity a counselor theoretically make sure all children happy never get out that's when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grew up in your home\nWell you know what this particular proposal relies on people to use money well you know what else relied on people to use money well basic reason and free markets selling dropping cash on people without actually using that cat for that purpose is counterproductive some moron Cory Booker big\nPlans for Democrats defending orders that comes up cash them you don't have on programs that are likely to fail we'll explain why the Democratic twenty twenty rate makes me going to be just throwing money at people like just a combination of the game will talk about a year [noise]\nOr gay people in the Nineteen Ninety Days you'd albums\nNope nope\nGay people can objectively claim to be attracted to members of the same ...\nThat's a subject and claim there is no way to objectively verify that so that is what it is I can objectively they're

miracle that God has given up all these wonderful thing surely there's ruined his world for these there shouldn't be ruins world for me\nThere again nobody is addressing that transgender people should be treated but you do not get to tell the entire ... to find biological fact on the basis of anti science positions because how you feel on the inside\nMy favorite part of the tea and listening judging the science is on the side of this policy there's no science on the side of the policy promulgated by the lab that does not just so they started off with ... but gender into unconnected attack and then they went to gender age that but it a bit of background and they went to check the jets again but it only exist on the spectrum\nI suspected tech didn't exist for a while now that just again but it only exist on his back when there's a spectrum attack their nose back from a\nHuman beings are sexually ... like okay if you do you want to suggest that there are other species what's that can change fine by you or not you're not a fish or not one of these ... and your human among human Texas not change that's not the way this works\nBut this has been pushed by the hard way until you get the spectacle of even cold they're cutting Trump putting President Trump on the trans issue and how telling is the remark about making pretty telling all play line and talking\nTo somebody ... thinking about writing a new guidelines for treating gender should we defined quotes on a biological basis but it's clear grounded in science you know you care about\n[noise]\nI listen to the crowd sure of that now you shouldn't be happy that they cannot times I'm confused he's either when it comes to climate change that the Trump Administration are only anti scientific when it comes to the EPA they're only anti scientific and that's bad but now they care about science when it comes to biological fact\nAnd that's bad because he didn't see the hip hop or seeing what he's saying himself answer is no because of the left even scientists malleable now my condition on climate change I've made clear multiple times on this program I did like an entire program on it a couple of weeks ago talking about the new IPC report\nThe world is warming it's warming at a lower rate than the scientists said it was going to according to their modeling probably a majority of that warming according to every scientist I've ever seen including what Spencer who has the rights favorite climate scientists suggest that the majority of that warming is due to human action that does not dictate global governance\nThe climate in order to dictate that we have to crush capitalism in spirit or an action but that is considered an anti scientific position by the left and it's considered a and it is considered gets bad forms mentioned science when it comes to biological sex now\nIf this was a new democratic conditions about what this guy's the la okay so I'm just a second we'll talk about some other democratic positions and why the news cycle continued to cut in favor of the president of the United states first let's talk about what\nYou do in the bathroom to get ready to go out every night well I use dollar shave club because I Love the dollar shave has everything I Need to look steel and smell my ... even more is the fact I never have to go to a store I mean I'm a I'm not in tandem to human and that means I don't have to go outside to even get on and stuff delivered directly to me\nIt can be fully stocked and what I use I don't run out here's our dollar shave everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for the recovered heading into hair in the unit and got it and they have a new program where they automatically kicking stocked up on the products that you you determine what you want when you want it shows up right at your door from month to month once every six months\nThat's what I Do I mean I use their their black pepper and said chapel which I really loved their ... and her body runs on which is\nJust delightful smells great and it leaves me feeling guilty smooth plus with their hands from discount the more you by the more you have and right now and then a bunch of started that you can try for five bucks like there are all ... after that the ... ships regular size products in regular price so what are you waiting for that you're starting to set for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot\nLast time a dollar shave club dot com last night so I have to but it's less agenda with regard to the anti science nonsense pushed by the transgender building is a natural tweet from New York Times science the idea that a person ... is determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it's not true for decades well we realistically speaking\nI suppose that's not true in the only in the most only last narrow time is determined by chromosomes and determined by genetics and theoretically you could have some sort of birth mal formation\nWhen you were born that leads you breath and the genitalia match up with your actual genetic so I guess in the dairy narrow extent that's true but the idea that that means effects on the spectrum among human in just stupid\nI Love this headline anatomy does not determine gender experts say right genetic determined gender\nElement researchers who study gender issues and provided health care to people who do not pay per typical male female pigeon hole the typical male female pigeonholed though they are just created by society\nOh male female pigeonhole typical male female pigeonholed though they are just created by providing said that the Trump administration's latest plan for the mind gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge yeah give it a permanent seconds determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we know that is natural for decades as John Otis Joshua safer and endocrinologist\nAnd the executive director of the ... the tender or transgender medicine and surgery of course I mean Mount Sinai helped them in New York you don't talk about a scientific stuff\nAnd you talk about whether they're beneficial effect to transgender surgeries over time and there is not good evidence to suggest that the end effect over the course of decades is actually can never get like the parrot no surgery and yet it does become part of the transgender movement shack now\nLet me be clear we live in a free country you want to go up your own genital that your problem or you can find a surgeon is willing to do that for you\nKnow for the free country but let's not pretend that science is on the side of all of the claims that are being made\nBy love it they buried down in the article I take genetics does play a role though oh you think oh you think so is it by the way you know how you know and not just going to tell you because if a male or did you have his\nQuick and berries physically removed in some sort of act and then he would still be a male and if he intends to do so in surgery we're not supposed to consider him an email\nAnd that did that it's not logical I Want to talk for just a second about the sort of propaganda that's been promoted on on the tissue and it really is insane propaganda so the the notion that it's pushed by the lack that transgender isn't is not a mental disorder is completely a scientific\n... now what what do they like this I think like the diagnostic and Statistical Manual because the DSM five ... that\nGender identity disorder is no longer a mental disorder and said look DSM five sad is that a mental disorder is it called syndrome characterized by clinically significant serving in individuals cognition emotion regulation or behavior that'll put the dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental prophecy underlying mental functioning\nNow that the the the funny part socially ... behavior and ... and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviant or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual prescribe bumps in other words\nAnd something it makes you think that a pink elephant is talking amongst his makes you feel that this is not actually a mental disorder according to the DSM\nThe definition makes room for its name queen room for politically correct posturing right if I and having a significant problem ended up myself all I have used blame it on the side even tolerance and there is no longer consider a mental disorder\nAnd so if you're just idle because you're a man who believes he's a woman\nTo get that and can still find a way to blame that on the side you have to say the reason I'm suicidal Armenian society not because I have suffered within\nTerrible conflict inside my inside my brain for my entire life\nAnd not society call it had an yes I'm five avoid the obvious implication that if you want to end believes your woman\nYou have a mental disorder and you're by the way if you're a cat person who believes or skinny or any person who believes Europe that we all have knowledge of mental disorder if you're in any person who leaves your fat it's called an Iraqi Shiites dangerous and it's a mental disorder if you're a person who believes that you do not need a left arm and then something called body just mafia this is a mental disorder dramatic believes you're a woman and you don't need a painter\nThen it's not a mental illness or its side he's fault\nYou explain that one to me\nAnd none of that has anything to do with science and all of it it's the typically designed to blame society for what is\nClearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm curious about calling it a mental disorder the reason I Do so in because you can't actually treat mental disorder by blaming it on the site and you want to come up with new treatments for mental disorder the way to do that is not by saying that society at large and it was possible for the comfort of people suffering from the mental disorder\nAnd somebody who takes mental illness extraordinarily curiously my grandfather when neither bipolar schizophrenia there's some lines that are that are hard to sort of diagnosed there\nHe was institutionalized when my dad was a child\nAnd gave him a lithium and he was much better at it I mean there is a good treatment for gender identity disorder gender to worry about to pretend that the treatments are all available and that transitioning is the only available sort of pick and that everything else aside he called the anti scientific in the extreme and with all that's at the last has embraced a bunch of positions that are unsustainable\nI Believe in American politics coming up let's continue to embrace other unsustainable

that's how he would work\nHe would work like see if I was with it but I'm not invited\nI'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang\nAnd it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to\nParticularly that educated genius of who speaks within twice a day or an advise and everything probably advise on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education is

they put ... in there it was all over how can you take people from one network and use them and you were administrators exclusively did Obama ever do anything like that\nYou don't have a version of very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all and it's not even personal it's worrisome to make what if Obama had hired the former director of I don't know CNN let's say ... or ... what if we woke up and said oh she Obama's\nTalking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice tonight on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them if this went on for years let's say a whole year no or than there and the guy who was fired from CNN amount imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job and the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues wouldn't be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you see what I'm saying you can't be blind\nTo what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that\nNot only with the way the corps base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if were blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independence I am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats forwards or backwards and upside down even on Sundays\nBecause you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical times even up demand that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you want a family member who you think is making a mistake socially or economically or in business\nAnd you say wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny can't do that because here's what's gonna happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other whereas there's blind loyalty this idea of blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grew up in I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate ... actually\nA very American idea [laughter] free thinking and vigorous debate those all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights free thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right\nNow people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what has come down to stay here they are in the inner circles in the ... though the wagons I used to call them Calistoga wagons when the ... the wagons of circled and all of us wearing hats after standing in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise you'll get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total breakdown of the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just thought it for myself and my own head\nThat's what we need to hear more about we need to have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who were pushing and shoving hit them back harder as my position\nI say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they kick us and they got to kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people who wanna rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something miss the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom Central America to come into this country right now do you think that would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco a celebrity it'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThere may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing the windows were broken down in their cars when they go to a restaurant\nYou think they like seeing them as managed to the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or the advantage to avenue is so broken up through the contract corruption that stores are going out of business do you think they don't see this\nThey don't see if they do see it and they say to me with a few times that run into and talk to them is I Can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals and they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country on screens on vetted some of whom are very dangerous someone who may be diseased\nAnd certainly the social service system which already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say force to stop the higher ups\nBecause uh I have a bit of the Confucius I'm a bit of Confucius was gene pool Emmy which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching a troop I Want you to think I I Want you to think about this the ... civil were alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrases\nThe same stories in the same mindset and the same phrases\nHe needs to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak\nTo the leading up to actual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be and understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger at firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\nJoy several major coal know eat bugs or four hundred salvage eat bugs or for over several do we do\nSavage Nation is

particular that was said and a lot of people lost their minds over this audio somebody twelve listen to the president here uh and this was last night and Houston\n[noise]\nWatched a\nLot about our country so\nWe just showed up\nNot sure [noise]\nAnd so the left lost their mind and they said oh my gosh this and this is so bad Hitler also\nSaid he was a nationalist who said he was the nationals Hitler was almost like they'll have the same talking points Hitler on the national Trump on the national is like\nThe two things and I'm going to come back to that\nI think there's a difference between nationalism and patriotism and I think that by respecting the law of the republic that makes one a bit of a nationalist there's nothing wrong with with a moderate form of nationalism there never has been\nUm and like I said there's a difference between patriotism and nationalism there\nAnd ... also when you are in a populist era nationalism which seems to increase in terms of identification and in in in terms of appeal\nAnd then\nYou can yes and you can have ... you can be both patriotic and you can have enjoy a modern form of nationalism\nMean there's I don't think that there's anything wrong with that but here's where here's where this gets it gets weird ah and there was a good piece of a friend of mine wrote\nThat uh was discussing this at at at National Review discussing how certain strains of conservatism might not fully identify with nationalism for libertarianism because libertarians they see as they write some see borders as barriers to free markets\nAre religious conservatism often emphasizes the God given dignity of all people which transcends national borders\nUh and then they say there are many conservatives are their American conservatives of different kinds which I had been influenced by you know there's a manifestation of patriotism there's you know some some uh support moderate forms of nationalism\nWhere it's not a sinister thing it's not a militia sing it there's you you have you can have\nGood nationalism and and and bad nationalism depending on how you how you practice and what you believe but here's the thing I Want to come back to it because all these people say oh well Hitler said he's the national it okay now do socialist\n\nDo social is now because the Nazis were national socialist that's the name so now do socialist front you Democrat socialist out there who are still mad because you'd say well terms I Need to national is in the Hitler said he's national okay do do socialist now\nAnd see how that works for you go ahead\nTo us that they were socialist go ahead that's right say Hitler sat right isn't that what you believe isn't that the the party to what you pledged\nI closed the policy do support\nBecause you naive Leon stupidly believe that the one reason they just haven't worked in the past is because of rights people\nDidn't implement them and I'm sure those people at the time thought the reason that their form of government hasn't worked in the path of because of the right people weren't there to implement them and the people before then thought that for one reason that their policies didn't work with because the right people weren't there to implement them\nThat is the definition of insanity trying the same stupid thing over and over and over and over and over and over again and expecting to be in any way successful when it is by design a failure\n\nSo there is a noxious form of everything\n\nI mean you can you can go I mean there's the example of democratic nationalism of which arguments of Lincoln and Churchill and Thatcher they were champions of national sovereignty they were champions of solidarity\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the loyalty to one country and and uh gratitude for the freedoms Erin and and allegiance to to\nThe people and culture and law that's what it is\n\nThis from an arrow when national confined political expression that support say federal government that are jealous of its sovereignty forthright and on on apologetic about advancing that people's interest in mindful of the need for national cohesion\nAnd worthwhile nationalism have these components but beyond the content of a country's nationalism depend on it's such a killer character American nationalism has an ideological component so much of\nOne as to render it exceptional that's the phrase American exceptionalism\nHad to render it exceptional that's the phrase American exceptionalism this is a truth underlined these simplification that America is an idea rather than a nation and reality of the nation with an idea\nBut John Quincy Adams famous remark in the federalist papers present America as an example to the world when he remarked how America quote goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy was immediately followed by she is the well which are to the freedom and independence of all\nAnd that is built into our cohesive American\nDNA and see that it's not this is as in our own notes it's it's it's just it's seen easily\nEnough and patriotic fanfare whether it's Memorial Day or fly over towards the ... of July Fourth fireworks et cetera tomb of the unknown soldier\nThese\nDebts explains the revulsion that most people feel when protesters burned an American flag because it's based on the belief not that the protesters are symbolically destroying an idea but I think that's how I look at it but some say that they are disrespecting the nation to which they will respect and filthy\nSo there's so many things with with patriotism and there's so many things with nationalism for the president to say what he\nSaid it is and he's not I thought it it asked the night and it it demonstrates and ignorance that has infected the left for people who bragged so much of an intellectual them rarely haven't seen such a display of its absence\nEspecially in reaction to this particular issue and the idea that somehow I mean it's all about ... sooner and to\nTo say that this is a noxious form it's pretty supposing that Trump's version of nationalism doesn't include all races are all religions or which is the train the goal of national unity\n\nWhich I Would I disagree with that but people who are part is that where they're going to try to find them something to justify their beliefs because it's easier to do that than it is\nJust simply say well maybe perhaps I can consider this alternative or maybe perhaps it isn't that way or maybe perhaps this economic policy is worthwhile\n\nAnyway we have a more to
