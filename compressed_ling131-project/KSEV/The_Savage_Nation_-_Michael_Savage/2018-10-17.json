Massachusetts not Native American but she kept claiming she was three years well why don't you just stop claiming it and then apologized for having done gel like five years ago\nOr a couple of good reason carrier thing there was a story that came out some hamburgers or make here in the Boston Globe and just got a geriatrician for all of the port\nWas Senator Warren actually a professor at Harvard law because she couldn't Native American ancestry in other words wishing granted special data that sort of gave her an upper hand when it came to her job and University of Pennsylvania or\nAt Harvard law school or law article from the Boston Globe ended up research found that folks at Harvard said that her Native American planes had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American Clinton had nothing to do with her actual ability\nTo be granted professorship at Harvard law school they interviewed to like burning on professors may who are on the admissions many coming from I Know people like Charles prayed about half a contract and didn't know when we hired her it had nothing to do with her claiming Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that a time when she was white\nAnd the internal documents congested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person in terms of Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim\nTo the minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum right they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she would Native Americans but that doesn't mean she got her job based on\nNative American Native American claim\nWatch without jet why didn't listen to foreign a month and a half ago simply give up\nI was told by my family members that I had ... after my mom you can tell me that my uncles and aunts and telling me that and because of that I simply assume that you're right I was going to assume that my relatives were lying and he doesn't stories that I was growing up I guess that was wrong\nAnd so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory that courage for exactly what's going to be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native American or having taken seriously the story of my family about checking them but with that said\nTo claim that I was the beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue\nAnd why don't you do that well there are two reasons you didn't do that and both of them are telling we're number one she thicker and she couldn't get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media did yesterday there were headlines\nIn the daily mean think Elizabeth Warren pros Native American ancestry the headline over the Internet was warned by solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she legitimately threw out a study that church was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the study showed you actually Native American and then it all together all heart because people can read and that led to her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she can get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean the media have covered for the fact that they don't work in package with being treated as an Obama at Kennedy new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in the ... who's wanting to involve him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to wean from the theme and they're still counting entered the big new next democratic and now I'm somebody who's had my license suspended for driving to that\nI'm obvious about that I Would not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody on an empty freeway they don't or driving drunk\nAnd hit a diet and then tried to leave the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that big nothing in the media that tend to George W. Bush in ... back in the Nineteen Seventy him disqualified in two thousand for money for the presidency like two weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good cause to think the media we're going to cover for her no matter what the media cover Democrats away they cover Republican half of the candidates for Congress in election cycle when he told me they wouldn't have finished the dominant in New Jersey would be done in the ... honestly any gun\nClaire McCaskill of Missouri wouldn't be done Christians Panama in Arizona would be just helps but they're not because only looks more like every other Democrat known that there is a great as a sort of buffer zone\nThat tablet for democratic candidate and so she can to lay claim Native American ancestry without any proof and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and then they'll just continue to cover for her and look like\nThat's the number one that'll work in a foreign felt comfortable releasing a study that actually contradicted her main narrative one coming up\nThe second rate than that wasn't a foreign self an assassin needs to continue cleaning Native American ancestry even though she was about to release a tattoo seven frightening she had no Native American ancestry we'll talk about a year ago [noise]\nHe says that he's going to he's not going to contribute any of that money to other candidate which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future and the Democratic party he really should become a patron of the guards riding shouldn't be taking that money and distributing it more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's in that story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the kind of\nUndercover journalist like he's gonna be shocked are left over a project maritime you've done some good work before he doesn't ... workers in he's in his folks into Claire McCaskill's often and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she and campaigning bars in the right where she actually is on the issue here some of what that counted like yeah I can tell them\nBecause she does go to ... [noise]\nBecause I won't say so much to either the amount of money like semi automatic [laughter]\nLike overly [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nHey Joe she's basically been sending about her own position so Claire McCaskill is in trouble in Missouri person talking about just three weeks ago was leading Martha McDowell in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out that all of her ... has come out of course in ... case though ... is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner\nShe apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails and pain by the Washington

supporters I'm a PG dilute the deluge your phone line of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policies\n... and I think ... in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism is the major issue here\nAnd all they have this President Trump which is why it's not good at the president of the United states goes around calling wasn't horrific\n[noise] I mean really this we'll get to more of that in just one second the Democratic response to all the ... and kind of shocking story Carter Page is now suing\nThe folks over at fusion GPS you'll get to all of that and

going to go in a super comfortable helix ... dot com slash Shapiro for the special deal so with all of the bed\nWith all of it that the economy continues to do while there's a such a good news cycle it really was in such a good news cycle the economy was doing great\nAnd then new jobs numbers are just terrific\nNot only that we have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\n... idiot he just look at the numbers were collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually taken more taxes and if the economy and stagnant and we have higher tax rate economy has been going great guns under President Trump and get the deficit and second which is not like that but\nThey very good news cycle of President Trump's in the last three weeks got U.S Supreme court justice and watch less kill themselves over Capitol you gotta live with Lauren and one of the great ... political blunders in my lifetime releasing a report saying she was Native American when she is less\nAnd less Indian than actual people from India like actual people\n... west Indian than actual people from India like actual people from India have more Native American blood middle is the board that\nAn amazing thing and with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people horrific this is the only line of attack that Democrat cabbage just attack on President Trump and so this is what they're actually on down the Baltic looking at a bad Senate map right now\nHe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the doubt\nThat the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to number of junk shot me there ... and American resident who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also had an uncle brother had\nShe says the reason from having been harsher 'cause maybe getting paid off by shouting\nAnd turned to Saudi Arabia I think that was ... I always wondered why he went there is the first country to visit him at the United states of course as president of the United states all the other presidents back to Ronald Reagan went to [noise]\nTo um Canada or if you want to Mexico for George W. Bush to enter the fear was that many friends and allies who could have gone to here there was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of a financial transaction involved there whether for his business is or what ever\nGood luck with your line of attack it it's pretty crazy that need that Democrats and the only way that they're going to be able to win election just by simply going out on verified and under Feibel information like that but it shows how desperate they are which is why again unforeseen errors are the biggest problem for the ... and they've always\nBeen the biggest problem for the Trump Administration here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever's shut the first one really because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever\nAnd you watch tennis players ... very often you'll see that that sometimes the best strategy is just getting them all over the net because sooner or later somebody isn't ... into the ... and then he went\n... and there's a great wind which which Canadian at the end is Mitch Hedberg is that ... that the name of the media um and so he has a line he says no matter how good the problem I have a ton of no matter how good I get I'm never better than the wall\nWell that's that's essentially what's happening in American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you wouldn't that's all if you are the person who just sit there and let the other side banging his head against you you would\nIf you're the person who commits on for the ... the Democrats have been committing unfortunately or after an forced air here and that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but and\nAgain I have an entire new cycle now about ... doesn't hurt Trump in any directly not really but it does jazz dropped the Democrats again it reminds them how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about this as much nobody cares\nBut but that said that Trump Trump Trump that just the way that Iran now ... and Tom\nAlso comes along with the benefit of Trump right and then there's always a good side to what Trump is and the bad side of what Trump is so the guy who called his former lovers horrific is the same fellow who's actually trying to stop need immigrant caravan that have been traveling from places like Honduras\nThe President Trump on Tuesday threatened with brought on the un aid from hundreds if it does not stop the caravan of people that had heading to the United states\nFrom the United states has strongly informed the president in Honduras that at the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given ... effective immediately\nUp to three thousand migrants crossed from Honduras in Guatemala on Monday on a track northward after ten of police in riot gear and warnings from Washington the migrants should not try to enter the United states illegally and then the crowd more than doubled inside\nAnd they do this they do this march every year where people are sent up from Latin America from Central America and to the United states more Trump threatening us with ... aid from countries that don't stop that seems\nNot completely unreasonable to me but that that he should be threatening Saudi Arabia as well think on their human rights violations and rightly any country that commit human rights violations in the way the Saudi Arabia has not sure why we should be funding the country\nEspecially when we have the capacity to do much more direct damage for Iran sanction I Am through military no out than the doubting do I mean the Saudis basically are there because we let them be they're coming up a big undercover\nStory Carter

all phrase for semi automatic fire on somebody to matter ... typically but they were like ... should be banned um and so her staff are actually\nSpoke to this uh in another video listen I can tell them\nTo go door to\nAlmost there's much\nOf a semi automatic\nMore soldiers\nWhich is insane to me because when you look it up yeah uniformed crime reports from twenty ... twenty sixteen it shows and

full joins me now on the phone James always good to have you and thanks for joining us\nSay data thanks for having me back again\nOf course so did the ... and people know Claire McCaskill Senator McCaskill in Missouri very tough race\nOr she's actually being challenged and this is the closest that anyone has ever come from from from basically you know taking her out politically getting her seat and she's been successful at it previously because she always presented herself as a moderate and she never on the big issues the hot issues that every other senators speak Don\nSeemingly incredibly quiet and ... and and your experts say I'm actually kind of discovered why tell us about it\nWell Missouri Dana ... I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative they are more pro life they're more pro God and there was a shrinking base that on a clear as to appeal to so this video tape and side of her office shows her own staffers\nAre saying they're her field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters um she says of course when we asked her about\nGun bans we got clarification from her staff you've heard the soundbite they're semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick stole roast says that\nShe has the same policies as President Obama but she has to mislead chi chi says that\nPeople just can't know that she had the McCaskill above a quote essentially have the same views on everything so there was this pattern in these red states Missouri being probably the strongest example where the Democrats have to live a half to mislead the voters\nBecause of the nature of the political dynamics in that state and that's what this videotape showed that shows all of our staffers saying\nWell she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of his staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything\n[noise] wow yeah she said that they ah what the video shows is that\nUh she still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets takes money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom demand and apparently mom demand a Bloomberg astro turf gun control group comprised a lot of her staff\n[noise] he has got robbed mills who's one of the higher ups in our office says that she doesn't open ... support moms demand action because in this is a direct quote because quote it could hurt her ability to get elected\nMissouri and see that and they're like well I don't want to support or even though they stand for the same policies so you're talking about his incremental approach where she'll she'll do it a little bit at a time and he says ... she's really good about strategy and making sure that goal it can get their\nUh she's worked out stuff with bombs demand to make sure that she can support their goals without supporting organization openly and there's this pattern in in Missouri where\nThe Democrats are there still are I guess a very tiny pro life Democrat community is shrinking because most of those folks have have chosen to become Republicans but there are there still she's still trying to\nLike she has to lie to half of the people and be honest with the other half and that's what this reporter so damning about because it just blows it all open there's a Greek chorus of people in our office all saying the same thing on all the issues Obama guns\nAnd Planned Parenthood there's even a thing about impeachment where we ask this this staffer Glenn Winfrey is the staffers and it was just so tell us about ... plans to appease Trump and\nWe the staffer says we're going to tell the moderates to quote get over it\nOnce we pull a bait and switch on them you know so it's just\nAll across the board inside of her office\nWow yeah and that and that was pretty I thought that was fascinating as well like get over it and that's what moderate\nDefinitely should pay attention to she's focusing on all of the things ultimately\nThat at a cost Hillary Clinton the election and it's you know it's difficult for her because it is a very much and it's a Trump state um a lot of Democrats voted for Trump and they're pretty pleased when you look at approval ratings ended approval ratings\nAre in Missouri they're pretty pleased with what he's been doing and what it means for you know the manufacturing the next day um that I I I had she responded as to the\nUm that I I I had she responded adds to the uh because I get itchy content to allow her staff to talk for her are all in all of a moderate to\nThat is the question I I was in Columbia yesterday\nColumbia, Missouri and I did talk to this next arose to walk down the street to his office door stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and a microphone I said look you know what why aren't you also people on these so I Can't another authorized to speak to the press\nAnd that kind of felt proud because like I felt like say well look they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you could talk to me but\nHe did not talk to me are we did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he tweeted the video out twice and I usually what happens data has happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass groundswell in from the grassroots\nIt'll do local TV one of the local reporters will ask clear and she'll have to fumbling bumble that's typically how this goes because there's nothing to say all of her staff are calling her a lot or what is she going to do fire all of her stuff will\nBe honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on unbeknownst to them they're whistle blowers and they're being very honest and forthcoming about what she stands for so it'll be interesting to see the local TV stations in Missouri ask the questions\nNow I Would I think that Missouri voters would like to I think everybody would like to know where she stands on it because she it's weird she'll be very vocal about weird things and then she goes and hides when it gets really tough\nSo uh we'll see we'll reach out to her to other I don't think she will ever come on but uh well if we can yet we've reached out repeatedly she hates me so\nI have you got more from her than any other than any other journalistic project varied has Avon dot com and I turned it on the video as Well James okay we're going to follow this closely because we'd love some clarification from Senator McCaskill as always thanks for joining us\nThank you so much\nYou can take care yeah I Would love to the I'm just very curious and and did you hear and then the video too if you watch it the staffer said oh yeah we got a lot of moms demand people that work here they're trying to import into that state just like they're trying to do in Nevada just like they're trying to do in ah Texas and everywhere else they're trying to Bloomberg is trying to import\nUh or export from New York end of the state New York style gun control meaning in New York state fat they're going to the state's going to make sure you store things the way the state wants it to et cetera et cetera uh but uh and and she's not vocal about it because it will cost her with voters\nSo voters in the state especially the more moderate one you know the only to figure out sort of where you you guys are going to be going with this ah because she looks like champagne on the up and up with you\nI Will reach out for clarification as well we have more to come including coming out Broadway star Patti LuPone says the Christian right it's no different from al ...\nOh I Know I see\nYeah the president ripped a Stormy Daniels right or make dino Daniel's calling her horse base she says game on tiny and accuses him of the reality this is where we are\nUh also it's only twenty two days until mid terms we have that

nothing about but because they can fire off a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientists other if in fact they're better\nAnd this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a moron in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd make the class pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so no one learns anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher\nI Know it's like that really gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards at all forms in every aspect of our lives\nNo one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so good from bad\nAnd so therefore if you go on a social media anymore on to take a picture themselves and now they're more famous than the ... people probably know strip them more than they do Albert Einstein\nI Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump is better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that you used to where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm listening to Lou Gehrig sorry I'm listening to\nThe Mozart and I see the article that Stephen Hawking ... the guy in the wheelchair very tragic don't get me wrong I'm not ... disease it's a very tragic disease\nBut it does not make came the genius on every subject on the planet including the kicking the guts today he said at his last book that we just got a glimpse at that I there is no God well I don't care what he said\nHe's one of billions of people said I said something about God why why his statement I got more than the next guy it isn't\nBut because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because he said there was no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that that's not\nI don't understand that anything that's all I Want to say I try to tell you something about cycads\nSay go palm the moral population\nThe relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are found in algae in lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might reduce toxins that are related to a less something like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it I park is you know what I'm saying\nCome January this is a topic I could do for three days health I may do a regular house segment where I don't have time to do it on TALK radio because you get you know you've got a different format and it's like the way this commercial writer you got to you've got to interrupt in order to support you show you need advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a park as you get a chance to expound in a little more depth with a little more you know insight\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining saying so here we are in the imperfect world\nTo bring some shots of perfection image imperfect world and we're talking about topics that most people that are interested in because why would instead immediately shift of the word immigration immigration immigration immigration Doris you'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should be [noise]\nBecause I said today what's going on in this country right now with immigration as a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I try to publish a book right after I got my doctorate in Nineteen Seventy nine eighty called immigrants with epidemics is after I had had six books\nPublished already [noise] and my co author was the dean of the school of public health brilliant man and nobody in New York with the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse has gotten here today it's gotten worse here today than it was then\nIt's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January I'm so major stations even though my ratings were higher than anyone else on the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joy and love Savage measure\nCold feet five four other service [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you'd see to gas stations and once held gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense and a little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we'd save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to have\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to manage chair for your health care it could be massive saving for you the typical savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you can do in that over time just doing the math at six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and he has people love it and they love it because they weren't relievers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy find out how much you can save\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis in death and children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a FM acute flashing my light is which is ... polio like now the CDC has been investigating this increase of a FM which begin twenty four\nBeen investigating this increase in a FM which begin twenty four but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC\nI fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what you mean pay for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses\nSo every every article says the causes of fmri is still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't do anything\nBut it's thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh in maybe a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that are viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM where the west Nile virus come from the west Nile doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from a well you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what I'm what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came our great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading and into the healthy population well those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine any one of the matter with disease they have that would go against the ah the\nSensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population is an increased risk of diseases like this from these third world countries in plain English\nCommon sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts of the country I common sense if you have a house or apartment would let some of the aisle communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably played with the person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were thinking price them in a kiss them on the lips the show a good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a saying nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying you there's a relationship\nBetween some immigrants from some countries on some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you run into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary yes was shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet ... on the Soviet rule I was stunned by it you are more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and it was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communists left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for free they'll be fired you're afraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner in more fear the ... the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling you know what I guess the tide is very very difficult odds here\nI write the book stop mass hysteria Americans and sadly from the sandwich rouse the Trump which is doing well but not great it's not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people want simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want history all they want a polemic ... I'm\nNot complaining it's the marketplace let the marketplace determine there's nothing I can do about it\nI Try something new I went from politics to a history and people were not really ... I don't know where the books are going to be on the list if it's even on the list after we call and I don't know whether you bought the book doesn't buy the book\nAll I Know is that went to my local bookstore Barnes and noble they said they sold it out so whether that'll indicate the country is ready to read something serious instead of a comic book or a comic book I don't know\nWhat are the less you have a television show on Fox News in particular\nAnd or you are lauded by the mainstream media as a genius and you have no television or radio show but you're on every show in the country books I'm a very very very hard chance to ever get into the public eye\nThose are the odds I like I Love it I've always like to swim against the tide I've always like lugging love swimming up up river\nAnd I'm reaching a poor I don't know if I Want to do it anymore I Know is an odd time to tell you about all this stuff but it's already almost November I launched the book I'm coming to the end of this cycle in radio and in the media I told you I Would never do another political book\nAlthough I'm being asked for already pleased to one more on the presidential you can't leave us because the presidential elections coming up uh twenty twenty pleased average just hang in there for one more cycle I'm not so sure I Want to do it\nAnd I don't want to talk much more about it right now because you're going to tell him I don't leave us yeah that kind of I don't want to do the old Mike they'll leave us I'm not trying to get you to do anything or said or which truthfully\nMaybe it's time for me to do with Johnny Carson is what I'm thinking as you know here's the funny part about how I work once thought start to flood up in my brain for my subconscious I listen to them I can only repressed thoughts for so long\nAnd sometimes you got to listen to your inner inner right now to listen to the old dinner and I'm reaching that point well what is it really matter\nWhat is it really matter the will have to do this until I drop dead on the radio I went to dinner last night with someone who wants to give me a television show actually I don't want to talk about it was really so well you know there's someone in the media was eighty four years old who said he's never going to stop to lease until he dies I said well I don't know that's great is that an oval\n... there's something about saying it'll work till you drop dead like a horse or the you know they should horses don't remember what the answer to dance folks that he dropped dead\nOr is there more nobility and leaving at the height of your career at the top of your career I'm walking out and that's the end of it these are the questions that I really am thinking about it a but here's the problem I'm drifting in from disease to this\nIs the problem with that thinking I don't have any hobbies not really I mean I collect old cars but I'm too old jaguars I don't drive him that much like a sitter in the garage and touched the carburetors you know\nUh I don't do anything I really like outside already oh this is what I really love doing that's the problem I've given my heart and my soul to this for a quarter of a

each other up on the field et cetera and you'll understand what I'm Talking about so we're talking about Lou Gehrig's disease because Stephen Hawking has died and he was considered a great girl about everything but he really wasn't and that will air on his last book he said God doesn't exist so on whether you see it was an atheist at the end\nHe was a bitter broken man from his disease it's sad that in his disease he didn't find any faith\nI don't know how I Would be if I had that disease I Can't say\nBut it doesn't mean that everything you said was gospel you understand what I'm saying so that launched us into the discussions we've been having today\nOn the show and I went into the story of a a less as I said to you I was very interested in that in that back in the late seventies when I was working for my doctorate\nAnd I did some research on it and I continue to be interested in plants and toxins meaning\nShe said well living in an age of mass psychology a massive notes on so many subjects including health nutrition health and disease so if I say to you that there are toxic and occurring a natural products that you have to be aware of people don't even know what I'm Talking about\nThere's a mythology today amongst\n... of ... because of the mass psychology mess psychosis where people say if it's natural is good that's the stupidest thing you could ever think of\nI can

even understand what we're talking about what the heck I'll give you an example toxic against that occur in nature that that you should know about so let's go to South America to the jungles together

that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own the stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing it because you if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and what are going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse or the zoo\nWell then you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it doesn't matter if the show loses money doesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\n[noise] so the only reason you listen to me at all is why well you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on a reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I said I'm Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk shows two things but that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted how great Obama was Obama was there so I'm always great Obama shoes shine bright anyone shoe bomber was smarter\nHow could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio what out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't know any of this Oh yes a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed the networks by running left for propaganda are now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive at all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the under it's that simple they'll find your on line or they'll find you on a podcast Philadelphia ... from somewhere that's that's how it is so is then that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go I didn't take a call I got this one of these days I don't know why it's so\nGood I Know why I feel good extra extra clear it's like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist by the guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into one of the nuts and the crowd\nLike one of the biggest are I mean he made a fortune became a top guy inside of I was surprised it went so high up in the thing\nBut he wasn't a kid's Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking while like in the sixties\nAnd I'll wake up and cutting its ladies like one of the chief school Rosen Scientology movement\nBut I remember the guy to a certain things they said they were really good like about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd they try to have any image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nFor really helped my migraines and like self cured was reading Georgia showers and Mac robotics and I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food\nTypes triggered my migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and it's just like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it what you're going to burn the engine out with and so my brain was sending back and single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and burn out to see his great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible\nButts and hears about\nMost of us have lost contact with the signals we don't want to hear them we've we've eliminated them\nAnd we put earbuds in whatever what he would do the I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message [laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink that draft shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink vodka it's not good for you today whatever but I I listen to a very close relationship\nSo I took his andme acrobatic diet that elimination sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio was I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study\nStudies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he got in the airlines I figured it'll be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to a habit of reading I don't know you could have turned off the list that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration graders around the clock ham bat\nWants that part down in the middle of his hair and you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy\nAnd become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was like and not notice handsome I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing on any no education and no no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lucas fellow in order to ... to cover up\nYou have to park your hair in the middle of looked like a Lucas fellow\nIn order to ... to cover up the defending hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young then you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole ... man what thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president I'm Talking about people in the media to call your tiny that's nothing to do with anything or the size of the brains and what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere out for at least someone that I Would vote some adult with nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving base thought it would be a good look you're a good guy looks and you have thoughts to than in your face start to look like Jerry Lewis after a telephone or in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupt that you know I I don't I think God in his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they are bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about is there enough to know what I mean even talking about I I Wonder sometimes I think you'd do because like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening\nTo me is that people have different cultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a yesterday I had a day off writes I go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me so it up and settle oh she's from Cambodia and she sent me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll pot created my relatives were killed in them and lived through them and I was stunned the here's a living woman who if you look there in the street would say she's a ball she's a liberal Senate Democrats are always think that if someone's from Asia there were a liberal or someone's\nAfrican American there were a liberal or someone's gay there and you'll have no idea\nWhat a person is politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some cops for example a diehard communist left us you wouldn't know that\nThere are many in the military who you think would be normally conservative Republican they left wing comedies you wouldn't know that either so you can never
