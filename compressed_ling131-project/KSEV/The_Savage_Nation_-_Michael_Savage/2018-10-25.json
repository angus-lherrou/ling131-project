of that site but I'm not going to attribute individual acts of violence and evil to individual political viewpoints unless those viewpoints are actively calling for violence and to do anything less leads to that sort of censorship that make the country at worst place in that way\nIf he believed that freak beaches inherently connected to violence you're more likely to crack down on free speech in

fully investigated in seeing everything President Trump that to the worst possible like the comments on nationalism are no capture the center of on the line when President Trump said that he's a national sheet that maybe it's because he's a white supremacist one anti Semite\nStop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand why he believes Lenny refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms ... these are not just dog whistles letters phone line it's racism is basically for many people and so I'm anti Semitic as white supremacy he knows very well what are you talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay maintain my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism on the president says nationalism\nI'm not hearing now he's saying make he prioritize the United states is border security over the human rights and people trying to make their way across the board you made it to agree with that but there's no way that that has anything to do with rangers ran into was it became the actual talking point across walk yesterday\nJemma cops on CNN and Wayne fine you somebody loving you like him Acosta loved him don't give a Costa here is Jim Acosta saying well maybe when President Trump's national working in white nationalist\nOkay or maybe like in my office that stuff I just think that you know here's Jim Acosta\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and they gave us there ... or ... or so and so on in Iran without offering any proof that may call yourself a nationalist and foreign sounds and thousands of people I don't think it's a short for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journalism me so much objective journalism in there from Jim Acosta means anyone or that people laugh when the president is an odd thing when he when he said things like we should protect our border and nationalism\nIn flashback you rock Obama cube album by saying exactly the same thing the rocket mama actually had right here is Obama circuitry down the line when he was a senator apparently and Lincoln the nation's guy there he was saying exactly the same thing Donald Trump\nOr journalists and welcoming people here in the United states but those are scary for legally and those who work for them just respect\nIt's also you know being half white I guess that he was a white nationalist as well it wasn't just getting a cop who at this point basically everything that he should be proficient in your diary because he does all of the quiet stuff out loud it was anything is Peter out yet or more objective journalism in from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nDefinitely dogs read other shows that are not just racial big easy enough over this has something to the president and sort of shied away from in the ass obviously nationalism was the phrase with Steve Bannon a obviously a brace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on and you\nKnow looking I'm somebody who is that that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the national wasn't alone is enough I think that our ties that bind history technical but what actually makes the United states the United states is the wrong idea embedded in the declaration of independence in the constitution and backed by two thousand years of Judeo Christian History around a three thousand years in jail Christian History\nBut that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism right that's what makes the United states' unique\nData unique I gave a world history officer MacPhail neither of the president using nationalistic Langley but she suggested as white supremacy is just any addict\nBut again it comes back to the basic idea you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise me me me hackles of people on the other side\nAll you have to do is just collecting motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business of doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our values we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent of our valley the only way you can divide up by\nCastigated people disagree with you on the manifestation of those values evil nasty bigoted horrible people\nComing on me and tell even the news got herself at some really hot water everybody does this time of year because we're approaching Halloween is supposed to start talking about Halloween costumes that means the cultural insensitivity and making telling him right on the land language about what she said it was right when you get that was wrong with that new hero cheese\nNowhere with Megan Kelly jumping that black people should be ... no one was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in your in any way in fact are making tell me what's interesting is that maybe why people want to dress up and some famous black people because they may or those dams black people\nThat are not in the same thing and people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party records a black person with black makeup on\nMe that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of ... her mockery\nBut I also think there's a difference between even a frat boy going to a party and a little girl who decides that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and so she puts on TALK make up\nThings I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference you notice the attempt to missing from the motives in our society is really gross Megan Kelly is not a racer and they can kill it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst at worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the history of black and the impact and still have on black folks in the United states\nThat the worst hit that there is no way to make and Kelly was actually conducting it's okay to mock black people\nThat is not what was happening there and yet here in CNN someone and she just saying that Megan Kelly actually is a rapist because there's never been a time when black face was acceptable first of all he doesn't know where she lives you know what kind of party she went to like I'm going to do that\nSo if he's been getting into making Kelly would racist when she was seven years old because you dress up and Diana rock in black and are paid for it\nI Would suggest that ... doesn't really know what he's talking about you may know when he's talking about historically with regard to black said but again there's a difference between darkening your face for talking them to rein in African American person and darkening your face you mock African American people\nAnd I said several times in the segment I still don't think you should do it to praise African American people specifically because there are too many black folks are going to look at that and say well maybe your mocking and maybe they're really doing that because you're not going to continue to you shouldn't do that\nBut the attempts to immediately\nAttribute the worst available motive Megan Kelly is really Kelly and it said something about the nastiness of our politics right now\nIs forty seven years old she was already there has never been any time in the front her forty seven years that blackface who's very acceptable [noise] um they're all white people in that now there were no African Americans do people of color there to say hey Megan not cool\nHey do this this is really really absurd you know again\nIt is taking ... misinterpreting mode of not I'll give you an example you want to you know you wonder how much should guilty that she was really how would you do industry the same way the Jamie Fox deals with these issues and Jamie Fox was you know it's obviously an incredibly prominent black man in the United states made lots of money as a musician as an actor very talented guy\nHe is very close friends with Robert Downey junior a few years ago he did a pod Catholic Joe Rogan and in the middle of the ... the question of Robert Downey junior actually putting on black face\nFor the movie Tropic Thunder came up Robert Downey junior nominated for best supporting actor Oscar there is no way by the way that even\nYeah I think when I was trying to counter maybe ten years ago eight years ago maybe eight years ago in any case there is no way that gets made even today because of the great sensitivity around identity politics but here in Jamie Fox it perfectly decent\nExplanation of Robert Downey junior and how you feel about all the\nPeople have to understand where it comes from there are real people out there that really mean you hear\nLike outside of us I mean there's some real people who really don't like whatever you are what are you black why you're viewed straight you do whatever it is there's some people who really don't want to move\nInto treatment and it's easy were easy target\nSo when when Jamie Foxx and jets you have to know where it's coming from there is some people who are bad out there who don't like it but Robert Downey junior is not one of those people why don't we start thinking of each other as people who probably couldn't be friends if we would stop treating each other like garbage\nAnd Megan Kelly is not going to a party dressed in blackface my black people and then it's kind of amazing how certain people get away with that sort of stuff because everybody assumes about motives on their cars for example\nTom Hanks in two thousand four within a fundraiser and that that fundraiser there was a comedian who got him as one Frank and he was actually making jokes while wearing black days right he's actually dark and and say and he was wearing a fright way\nAnd Tom Hanks was cool with that\nAnd the controversy laughing about five minutes because Tom Hanks I looked in that never should have happened it was inappropriate I don't know what's going on there I understand people were offended everybody said right Tom Hanks dozens of race as we know he didn't mean to ... people we know that he's not interested in taking in in somehow hurting black people and everybody got on with their lives\nBut because we are interested in right now and what can we can people to the wall over that make for the worst available country the worst version of ourselves and that has to stop whether we're talking about making Kelly or whether we're talking about President Trump or whether we're talking about the the attempt to nail people on the other side of the aisle an inverse okay\nI'm going to talk a little bit more about that plus I Want to talk about the latest on the caravan issue in ... as I can and plus there's been breaking news on the return address them vicious package it\nBut first let's talk about the fact that you are going to die I Know\nDark thought starts off today but the fact is that if you haven't thought about that you're probably also haven't thought about getting life insurance and you ought to have life insurance just as a responsible human being\nNot many of talking about like insurance but it's kinda hard to buy because you have to work out what you need to do the research to find the quote hope you don't get swindled well that's why you need policy genius policy genius compares quotes from the top like in\nIt's window well that's why in ecology genius biology genes compares quotes from the top like insurance company\nAnd they find the best policy for you it takes just two minutes to get a call and they don't know anything about insurance and that all the tools that you love the lord of the difference between time and whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need you sure you're making the right decision in fact over four million people hadn't you tell the genius to shop for insurance\nHow teaching it doesn't just do life insurance either they also do disability insurance home insurance auto insurance if you care about it that insurance for it so when do you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start you're surfing policy ingenious dot com and too many you can compare close make an informed decision for you and your loved one\nHow genius and indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance policy junior dot com go check it out right now and let them do we tell you\nOkay so the the update with regard to the bombs that they're they're trying to address that was put on the label Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office that doesn't mean that tend to watch them until they actually sending these bombs and things that somebody is probably trolling by doing exactly that okay so\nI Want to talk a little bit about a little bit more about you know where we are at side in how we how we care all of them\nAgain when you can start with the premise that the people that we are talking about generally do not have harm in mind that their goal is not you destroy it in any way if we figure that they don't have normal election yes ... he's election but we're not going to be trying to kill each other because we can assume that\nMost people in the United states grew up in the same dealt with the same guys and we did\nAnd it I mean the reality is that we all grew up in the middle you our values are not all that different even though as right wing members of the United states and the members of the United states theoretically agree on certain dates and value like freedom of speech and treating each other compassionate land decently\nAnd why things we all grew up in the same thing when you're up in the ... fighting you share a certain level they find out now I think that splitting I think that's one of the problem the country but one of the way that's what is exacerbated by simply a similar political disagreement reflects underlying character differences now speaking of political disagreement and you\nKnow the polarization of our politics that social fabric those common values that they are being wet and you're seeing it in in some of these democratic campaign one of those campaigns from state you Adam she's the Georgia gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats and she was caught on tape talking about free market here's what she had the day\n[laughter] and here you know I don't know [laughter] [noise]\nFigure [laughter]\nYou're free market [laughter]\n\nHave armed and you can hear she's saying the free market I have never solves any problems in the medical field which is obviously an for your baseline root issues in American politics I think eight to eight and I'm therefore lacking and now I don't think she's just wrong I think she's wrong and she doesn't know enough about economic and she's misinterpreting the economics that you know\nBut she had that person I don't think the Enron probably not even though they you know there's tape of her I I Believe now burning a flag back in college now ripping directly from script written by Aaron Sorkin like we're actually just going to do the American president all over again with take the ...\nI I've noticed this weird trend in the news that like a couple of days like there was there was a ... plane that landed on the one oh one north\nOkay like not that far from where we filmed that\nAnd all I can say thank God for the ... because the royal Airforce really take care of business making sure the ... and so the man in a high capital is coming true that's exciting and apparently saint the Abrams is directly from the American president\nAnd then there was a story that I thought that it I could look exactly like David swimmer robbing a liquor store\nAnd and robbing a beer so raw from friends has been cut loose and President Trump the president Donald Trump the president and the United states do you know Scott and Scott Adams the guy because we needed living in a simulator I'm starting to maybe believed that we're just living inside we're we're we're script but in any case\nAnd the ... the divisions that that are growing in the country does need to be rectified it cannot be rectified in any serious way I'm not going to start it to stop it from being the worst available modus hey everybody and that holds true even with regard to some of the companies like worship for NATO Aurora which\nFoolish but I don't think it's coming from a place and people were bad I think it's just coming from a place and people who fall in love

with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen and they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they're liable actual San Juan to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine were killed that's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monitor and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it doesn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately\nI Am and trying to tell America for a long time now that there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democrat Party willing to make peace they only know hatred of war\nBut I saw pictures of the illegals coming over\nWith a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age and the and clean the clothing and so my headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what could I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor in a gang bangers so what can they do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it was that Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\n[noise] this is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you left referred to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was\nAnd as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nAnd in order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle into signing the NAFTA deal with them because they're that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance show how we're going to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you when you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals and the visit us when the barbarians otherwise broke through Roman broke the nation and a half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's disarming of young men barbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a martyr Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be illogical\nSo less both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand\nA small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races\nSo why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you are in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have to arrange walking the streets\nBut I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now\nWhich is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but let's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome\nWhen the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell and it's just I tell you the whole story right they broke through what more do you need to know I hear the whole story now you'll get bored I Know your children out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire that into east and west where al ... describing stop mass hysteria and as a described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was lifted a very important for you to hit us\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like a gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then they face the barbarians on their borders\nAnd guess what happened next well all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now remaining\nThe visit Godzilla west Scott's behind those in South Russia when the each Scott's or asked her guts and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lambs and then with the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together and thought for a minute\nWho do you blame how about both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on them on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we wanted something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't\nSo you can blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the presidents and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture's worth ten thousand words\nThey're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact southern Jake Tapper can a Yankee or guilt chain and Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say hey that's racist\nBut we all know what this says is an invasion or ...\nOr it's an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying it because of current or it I mean I read ... lives in my soccer\nAnd as a girlfriend so I Know it actually central isn't as as a wonderful phrase is an existential threat was originally used here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago when he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this is a true a truly an existential threat to our borders language and culture so the question is why is nothing being done I don't see anything done\nNothing wrong to the next subject to rally\nJoy love

Wasserman Schultz a Governor Cuomo\nA as well as ah the Clinton and uh the Obamas and\nA Eric Holder and that we know that the ones that were sent to the Obamas uh I think it was Obama's\nHolder and then and then there's than to CNN too but at least four of them they\nHave confirmed that they are\nA related as then it's the same uh it's the same\nIn individual apparently behind it they had a Debbie Wasserman Schultz says the return address which is weird uh the ones that Clinton as far as we're not confirmed which is why didn't include those in there\nThere's a reason why I said they're specifically only for that they've confirmed because only four of them had Debbie Wasserman Schultz the ones that Clinton and Obama are ... those were completely separate so there's a reason why I said at the way I did\n[noise] um the other thing that struck me as an odd and I've been seeing some discussion about that that there was a a photo of the one that was sent to Brennan and it had stamped all over the package et cetera obviously but there wasn't postage marking on the stamps\nI mean when you when you send a package and you you have stamps on it you get posted marks on the stamps right this didn't have them just didn't have any stance on the package at all so\n... what\nI mean think about this as well um and someone else or a bunch of people that are make that a ... a couple of other people made this point to the a pipe\nBomb I mean that ... and that could mean a number of things by the way the incendiary closer devise a but this particular device uses steel piping and when you're shipping a package you are you're being charged by the weight of it and\nSo some individuals apparently some people who even working or have worked in the post office before they resemble the stamps wouldn't have covered that and everyone's speculating you know just how it would have been the day all we're in agreement that will do six stamps wouldn't have covered that\nIt even if it went through but there were no posted posted markings on it at all whatsoever so what ... what I Am wondering and what other people are questioning because the Soros one was hand delivered to that facility\nDoes seem like this was also hand delivered to\nNow that makes me wonder was where the Clinton one was that handle eBird was\nI mean there were these ... I mean these were these all hand delivered\nI mean I think that that kind of um I think that's kind of a fair point to ask and\nAlso if they were is there any which I'm sure they're looking at I mean if there's any sort of security footage et cetera et cetera where you could\nUh um where you could\nSee the uh\nYou could see you know just exactly who it was that that did it I don't know it's just that because that strikes me as weird I mean I'm looking at this photo of this that strikes me as incredibly weird um do we have time I know it's our quickly segment where time to\nKick into some quick five\nYeah look ahead let's go ahead for duty quick five okay so this is the latest that are happening right now is side from the developing story that we are watching at Michigan City has banned clowns on Halloween Oak Park city officials say climbs or too scary\nSo if you're going to go to their party to boot bashing the Detroit suburb of Oak Park you can either be anything you want you just can't be a clown clowns are banned in Oak Park a seventh child has died this was a horrible story I saw this yesterday and in a seven child died after ... a deadly\nA virus and an unsanitary New Jersey pediatric nursing facility\nWere eleven children are still battling infection suicide surgeon Venezuela we have a lot more in stores stay with us here [noise]\n\nOutdoor limited as your one spot stop\nFor all your ammunition needs outdoor limited dot com has one of the largest docking inventories elections of the ... fire hand gun and rifle ammunitions every item listed in stock on their website is on hand at their warehouse no third party drop shipping and no backwards featuring great brands from federal ammunition like federal premium\nFusion an American eagle outdoor limited the family owned business that has been and wife team started the company and their garage at four\nYears ago and they believe in selling good products at a fair price they carry not just ... but also ... such as magazines cleaning supplies and targets outdoor limited is my personal go to for all of my ammunition and shooting need great prices fast\nShipping visit outdoor limited dot com right now we're the five dollars off your first purchase of one hundred dollars or more with code Dana check out their great prices that outdoor limited dot com and huge promo code Dana that's outdoor limited dot com\nI Do think that this is absolutely I mean it's some sort of\nUm it is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it it's domestic terrorism\nSo scary and I mean I needed a goodness so we're going to continue watching this this uh this this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting developments on\nAnd I don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio Andrew Cuomo engaged in an earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous we're not doing that um but that's I'm telling you it is a\nIt is ...\n... yeah ... I mean sixty six stand for the weight of steel pipe fix stamps for the weight of steel pipe\nI just don't I don't see that I don't know\nI I somewhat also so Bryan on social media was also than hard to determine the explosive way when it couldn't have been much so I this yeah I Am just really\nYou've had this you have rights and that was sent well suspected writes into Trump to James Mattis to Christopher Wray Gina Haspel Heather Wilson to John Richardson earlier this month\nUm and then just when if they determine uh who sent this\nThen\nI mean this is just getting out of hand this is just getting out of hand I mean this is you know just come on just come on\nAnd it but but and that was that was those were actual that was the actual domestic terrorism too I think this is also domestic terrorism\nSo we will uh\nWe're gonna we'll continue see to it it will continue following the developments as we get them there was um apparently so now apparently suspicious package was intercepted by Capitol Hill police and it was addressed to Maxine Waters according to\nSeveral sources this is her a B. C.\nSo this is\nA\nThis so they sent to Maxine right and I don't know if this is the same\nIt we don't know anything about it at All right now at this particular point except that that was just it was intercepted in a it was sent a Capitol Hill police got it\nAnd and we'll see I'm sure we'll get more information more development as to whether or not it was like what we have seen with the Brennan packaging without pipe bomb et cetera\nBut I'm just I mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um and\nThere are a lot of theories going around there's a lot of stuff going on I like to wait as we get more information\nI like to wait and see and the reason I say this is I go back to when you know they had the the election um it Israel's last election what was it there there was there was a report that there was um\nA bunch of ... to all of the Jewish centers and everyone was thinking oh it's the political system set and it turned out to be the just just knocked job teenager\nAnd Israel and then back in twenty fourteen I'm a scorn spouse trying to find her husband\nEnded up sending writes letters to the New York city mayor and the White House back in twenty fourteen twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen so that's why I say you kind of all we all it's always smart to wait\nAnd then when you find out and then when when when we find out who and the motive then by all means but\nYeah this one that the awful if there was no sorting coat on the novel up there is no postage marks on the saddle whatsoever this was never handled by by the United States Postal service is that he was not handled by the United States Postal service at all\nThis with hand delivered\nDid point this ... this package was hand deliver [noise] so if it was hand delivered that means there's going to be closed circuit footage but here's the other thing I think about that\nNow it\nIs possible because you have what you have the ah\n... Clint ... I'm trying to get Clinton Obama joined DC you have the I the Capitol Hill ones I Would imagine are those I'm sure we'll we'll figure out if those were\nUm hand delivered are mailed\nBut since all of these are hitting about the exact same time these all\nCould not have been hand delivered correct or could they have and it wouldn't have suggested it was more than one person involved\nRight it's hard to believe because the hub were former presidents in the White House get their mail is where\nWe were discovered so unless your hand delivering to that schedule and into the yeah the CNN the New York with the ... and the light and and I don't know where the Clinton sorting facility was that's why your viewpoint of drinks with those you know yeah that's exactly where it's a\nShow with some of it on now Laughlin\nExactly where it's at so\nWith some of it on now Laughlin mark hey over\nAt the daily beat says he thinks\nThat there isn't a he says it looks like there's an ISIS flight on a pipe bomb that was sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz\n\nSo all we I I don't even want to try to before I verified but I Do think that it is\nA\n... that would be very and I don't again I think it's even too early to determine that\n\nSo there's just a lot a lot here and then that and then that brings up a whole other you know are we going to have our mail system used for terror but this is absolutely domestic terrorism there's so\nMuch a there's a lot happening right now and uh and and and a lot a lot of development coming in on this and that but I Am fat because that wasn't the only person who said that\nThis isn't the only person who said as a fucking ISIS flag lock on our K is not\nA ... I've been live on for ten years he's pretty much a moderate so yeah that's very interesting a lot of people are going to be looking at footage I Want to take a quick break and I'm going to round up just some of the developments because there's a couple more um\nThat I Want to make sure that we have and uh when we got a break here I'm going to take that time to do that or and then also we have other headlines to get into as well\nUm they are because this is all of these happened around the same time\nAnd it's a lot of these were hand delivered that had to be more than one person\nI just don't and I I'm not that I'm just saying I don't know how to the possible for it to not be so well we'll get into I we I Know we've got a lot to a lot to uh get into so uh we have a more stuff to come\nOr in the meantime as we get moving on I tell you one of the best thing to do to exercise your Second Amendment right to make sure that your training and that you are that you know you're you're you have a particular skill set to defend your life and out of your loved ones so that heaven forbid if you need those skills\nYou can rely on them as opposed to not having them and meeting them\nAnd that's one of the things that ... support Cal Tech is a very family oriented to a small business I mean they've they've started I mean George ... started the company I mean this is the tail of a of a a as an American immigrants success story who created a very awesome business and that employs a lot of people a lot of veterans\nAnd they ... the the employees they're genuinely love their jobs and George it and he's a driving force behind every innovative fire on this manufactured by this company or whether it is you know their pistols whether it's the rifles whether it's you know the already the both have done right or\nThe pay three eighty which is the one of the most copied handguns out there a small a small carry a gun I loved it I think everybody should have this particularly lady\nA ... that writes quality a safety innovation and affordability check them out at Cal Tech weapons dot com K.

attack me they think they can get to me I look at them and I said all that section of children they don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life and it has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which is children children it's all about the children and ... what I Love is all those are talking about the children most don't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that the ones who are most interested in children have none [laughter] how does that work\nWhy are they qualified even talking about your children if they never raised on what did they know about raising a child labor state of night with a child with the flu and lost sleep\nHave they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math or because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests\nHave they ever gone to plays they didn't want to sit through for the children have they sat on soccer fields in the cold to cheer on their son no but they are all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and those of us who actually raise children are sneaker that as readers\nBy these wonderful people who have taken over our society you see what I'm saying\nAt least that's how I see it\nAnd I just don't buy this right now there's little particular\nCharade I I

outfit or the or at our a outfit whatever and it's probably not an an array outfit like I Would say camouflage jacket with a Trump a sticker on a Trump flag or something a truck packed the ultimate a villain here would be somebody with a ... hat\nAnd enter a sticker on a camouflage jacket with a Confederate flag or shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThat was the perfect the perfect villain marched out and then they'll have a script in his hand and get something out of a president in Tallahassee or Georgia I don't know and are from like let's say a free health care first family for three generations of you'll take the fall\nAnd maybe a you know some money thrown in with a one way trip to the Virgin Islands and it's just silly and fishing boat\nAnd then it'll say it'll declared yes I got all my ideas from talk radio I listen to talk radio and I know that all these people are even trying to destroy America the new world orders and that's why I did it\nYou will try to destroy America the new world order and\nThat's why I Do that can happen\nAnd if it happens to a level that so what am I going to do I don't know what tomorrow will bring\nAll I can do is take it one day at a time and use the powers of reason the God gave me and it's not yet taken away from me back yesterday when I go I Can't quote the person but yesterday I
