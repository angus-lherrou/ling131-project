realize many of you are sick and tired of hearing me talk about my book I understand that but let me ask you something\nI Want to ask you a sincere question have you heard about my book on the other is themes conservative shows\nHave you ever heard in the audience about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't so I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we have seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon\nAnd I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe\nAnd the shocking it's a video of sorrows funded empty ... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people ... calling anyone white a coup Cox clan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting\nOr a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had airtight whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse a Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the amity that is raining in San Francisco and in Portland and in Seattle and in other dozens of extreme left because of that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been a fuel for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California at Berkeley like you are in a commencement speech three years ago said we're all disruptor she encouraged\nPeople to go in the streets and cause chaos\nTo block traffic what does she think what happened or about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist

aren't has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there's no tied to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there's always the area and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was no witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't a pornographer all white\nMale heterosexual Christians why she of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very historical times and very dangerous hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many houses you\nKnow what I'm trying to do it here and save America before it's too late\nAnd so I'm asking you the Savage Audi\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book\nWas the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books are millionaires on they're making news said oh I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchased to be on a new release table between

Would say that you tell me about the more important vote [noise] tell me which is more important right now is I don't know of one\nAnd so what happened when you went into the stores and what are you going to do with\nMany of you are buying the book for yourself and friends\nTo try to have a dialogue with that [noise] and that's the main thing [noise]\nDid you buy one for your liberal neighbor to

you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it one of the best things and\nHere we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon to you and for me for that matter\nGovernor Huckabee has his own show and it was left off last year by those people in the the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed him and laugh\nThe cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee and his show\nHas one of the most loyal and phenomenally larger audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nHas become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot\nWherever it is seen now last year Governor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on a show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God's sake and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me because he's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he was in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phones are not out from the storm and try to reach us you know in a land line or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackouts and remember he's been\nHe is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nAnd there's no hysteria out there none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not historical or Marlboro not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my loyal listeners understand uh the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now and we're talking about that [noise]\nBut we're talking about the news in a day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon I mean right now we hear the Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker named dean up how to be the new UN ambassador\nYou'd say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to not be a globalized to not appoint global is so high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan\nRight nationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First name looks plane that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said you are the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned as because she failed to ignite a war with Russia my bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was reading the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs has Nina Powell and they have to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying now she worked for this government she was working in the administration and she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for demonstrations has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting the write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right\nI Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you were the tail end you continue to wag the dog for so many years and suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory that are too complex for the average Fox News ...\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to night war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and to attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit here and ... say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out is because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have drag us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America's second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that happens is um twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east it's time to use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars that bring us into them\nBut I guess you all forgot that\nAnd on a personal note well you know the trumpet surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global it's like Nikki Haley like moustache you out\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally rolling rolling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city in the ... whatever it is and Russia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city\nAnd in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in to clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam had what's going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war the whole world is watching everyone has an iPhone you unleash poison gas on your own women and children who wouldn't do that who believe a story like that other than idiots\nWho by a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it they'll do it\nI sent a message after message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not to Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history I Will rest knowing and my family now isn't it pretty bright people that it was\nI Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people that it was our you will help push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed him over the finish line even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total and

anyone like that in elected office because the United states has made up of a multitude of different beliefs and thoughts and in order to dehumanize your opposition\nYou wrongfully pass them as people who are ... the new\nAnd destroying your the things in what you believe in simply because they went elections and they exist that's how I interpret her statement running it through several filters that's how I see it [noise]\nSo I I just um I I don't think that that helps and she's sitting here saying well we can't have civility until so what she's saying is that the longer people disagree with you can't be civil she's telling people to not be civil\n\nAnd I remember how mad people got at me when I did a show promo and I use an hourglass to know when the show would start and how everyone including the New York times and Clinton's surrogate screech from the rafters oh my gosh it's so violent\nHere she's telling people to stop being civil with other individual simply because they think differently from them and yet that's not a call the violence back then waters is Nicola violence I mean if you really want to have that conversation\nI just think that's incredibly irresponsible you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nShe's\nEverything that she everything that she does and everything and what she believed it completely manufactured because she said that and she caught this attitude after the fact Hillary Clinton is always a day late in the dollar short I mean days late like months days late\nBut now now she's copying us I just find that fascinating\nI mean it's just it's just manufactured in Seoul is you can't be civil with people well your party has already stopped being civil\nThey've been doing that ... that's that's been happening for a long time I I I Do think it's it's really\nFunny that she's saying she's looking at what her party doing and she's trying to speak to them in a way to still remain relevant because the base of the Democrat Party they believe in the tactics as a way to campaign they believe in these tactics as a way to\nUm to to\nTry to when when they lose at the ballot box let me share with you this headline\nThis is from Robert Costa of the Washington Post I find it really funny it says an angry mob Republicans work to recast democratic protests as out of control anarchy\nSo this column in order to be honest would have to ignore all of the antifa violence and all of the other progressive protests and all of the stuff from this weekend they would have to do all of that\nUh Republicans don't have to work to recast Democrat protests as anything I've you know I think burning buildings in punching people in the face and doing all of that stuff um they do a good enough job of that they're by themselves\nThey do they do a good enough job of that all by themselves\n\nAnd they work and like for instance with the cabinet situation I have seen and this is the left is really stepped up their attempt to try to dehumanize people with whom they disagree [noise]\nI've seen them tried to cast the cast Kavanaugh and and everything else as well he's you know he is a a he guilty as he's a rapist she had this they're making statements about him that have been no proof there's more proof of big foot then there is that the any of these accusations are true\nThere's more proof that the abominable snowman exists and there are that any of these accusations are true there is more prove hell and global warming and then there is that any of these accusations are true\n\nThere's more proof of the last man than there is that any of these accusations are true more proof of Santa more proof of the tooth fairy and more proof of the Easter Bunny than there are any accusations then they're then there was any proof that these accusations are true\nBottom line but it hasn't stopped the left from still trying to cast you want to talk about working to cast their working to kept the now justice and trying to they they they want to up in the Supreme Court now and that's not me just say this I was looking at Lawrence O'Donnell they\nWant to be Shakespeare MSNBC who was saying well this you know we really are going to have to [noise] uh we're gonna you know we have to rethink\nYou know talking about the Supreme Court and and and maybe uh maybe you know and the number of senators

them and the airport if the Senate that's a problem\nThis is why they don't win because they don't get it they don't\n\nRepublicans don't have to work to cast him as anything they've they've done that themselves they have done it themselves and now they're looking at polling and it is well it's not going\nGood for them they may have hurt themselves in terms of being able to try to flip the house I

life and so forth you can prevent yourself with equal for the seventies show you you can shove 'em right back\nAmenable aiming someone's shoves you let's say you're Seventy years old and a twenty year old son shoves you it's not the same shove the force of the ... is different isn't it\nThat's right that's right Dr than if they're not firing a credit for that person to leave the ... the safety and call nine one one if the restaurant in themselves what a restaurant how to do well\nIn the restaurants are are trapped in the old days you or imagining you run an Italian Restaurant to little Italy and the owner was a guy would have thrown them in the gutter you would have pulled a club out from behind the counter smash their head and throwing them in the gutter they never would've allowed that in a restaurant but those days are long over\nWhen I came in and Goodfellas and they locked the door and beat him up with a Bronx Tale either one of our city but it doesn't it doesn't operate like that anymore and operate\nSo okay so we're now powerless to the kids so what are we supposed to do\nWell you could hire an attorney after the fact that issue of the restaurants\nDown on a I'm Talking about at the time the sub does bother you witness screaming and yelling can you sprayed them in the face with pepper spray if you're threatened\nIf you are if they are in the image of danger and you feel that you are an idiot apprehending hard of your life or immediate a counter art yes you cast your cat for\nAnd what if you're a middle class white couple I'm gonna make it very personal in your sixties and a group of rabble come up and scream at you call you names racial epithets like white there's Whitey as they did in Portland is that none of salt that's a form of assault isn't it\nThat is that is a form of a thought than the individual for all the people will be held liable if they're caught fire that that the amount that I caught\nI caught while the cops stood there on his motorcycle I haven't seen them get fired yet by the mayor Ted\nWheeler I think it is uh Portland, Oregon I mean the height and accomplish on a motorcycle on the same street they were doing this to people the black lives matter people calling them every name under the sun and re directing traffic\nOr you can blame accomplished not playing the copy blame the mayor is the issue here but what's the good of blaming anybody if they attacked the man who was in a car and Seventy years old and started banging on his car would fix what what could he do\nHe got out for some reason I Know that you're talking about oh man and elected he jumped out to look at it and he actually did the right they afterwards got back in the car left standing there he would have done more damage your math and her he did the right thing by leaving\nBut no one has been arrested by the mayor of the city of Portland, Oregon and out of control hello a garbage can use to be one of the most beautiful cities on the west coast it has become a filthy garbage can\nLike San Francisco under the liberal totalitarian fascist to run this city Seattle Portland a San Francisco\nI can name five other cities that have deteriorated as a result of ultra tolerance under the guise of liberalism\nAnd so what is the average law abiding citizens supposed to do hide\nUnder under federal law Freeman to federal court ... local municipality and shoot the map that possibility for individuals agree there are federal alternative however that goes to show that so states and cities are operating like a neo Confederate the not abiding by the laws of the United\nWhile I like that and the confederacy so in other words they've already declared a break away from the union and they're running under their own out of the slack\nFor years unfortunately for years unfortunately and now All right\nWell thanks lawyer lawyer or a Chris thanks for your sage record but when I hear from you is don't do anything basically\nA until you're attacked no I'm not so sure that's the right approach\nTheir arm intermediary steps such as taking out your ... your iPhone and photographing them the way they like to do the way they harassing police now for Twenty years immediately get out your iPhone or start photographing them the minute they knock your iPhone to the ground a grand but they've committed a felony is that correct\nAnd it kind of thing you know if they're trying to take it from you in terms of criminal law once they are forced to take an item from someone that becomes robbery as well that's all right\nPaul ... who's going to help you with that point the restaurants going to send out the ... the the Marines who's going to help you know you either ... who's going to help you nobody\nLie on on you're right you're right I mean we're at a point of no return and the police are bigger than I think you're perfectly for dedicating your book to the police law enforcement\nLet me send you a copy of stop mass hysteria which more lawyers like you understood\nWho the police really are and the left wing for him and lawyers and go after the police are actually the or the equivalent of the retroviruses that attack our own immune system and prevent diseases that are ... nations or under the surface to proliferate\nA I'm a student of epidemiology and I do know how it works and went our own defense sells the white cells\nAre attacked by a white cells that have been infected by a certain virus\nAnd then attacked the white cells themselves and start killing our immune system now you understand who left wing lawyers are and what they do to our police who are our first line of defense against invaders by infecting the defense cells themselves including many police departments haven't invaded by them\nCarefully made certain both our military in our police had been I'm ah in my shoes the correct word he had been infected\nWith these retroviruses called ultra liberals in law enforcement it's almost a misnomer how can you being ultra liberal and be a law enforcement\nWhat does that mean you're gonna selectively not enforce the law if you like the politics of those breaking the law is that what it means yes that's what it means to Eric Holder\nSo now we are seeing the world when that was unleashed upon us by the Obama holder team up to ... we got a two for out of them okay so now we have a new president what can they actually do about this I'll tell you once he's going to mark and mark today down\nI told you that I Lived through the Vietnam War protests I saw the organizations and how they worked I saw the Chicago Seven trials\nI Know the whole story of the Abbey Hoffman's on the other room and I saw them operate I saw what they did to this country and now we have Bernie
