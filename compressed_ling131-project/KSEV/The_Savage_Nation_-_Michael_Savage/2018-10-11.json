happen\nIs not because of president in from it's not because of the Republicans and Democrats have decided that they are going to look as ugly and terrible as humanly possible in public as often as possible so funny because the Democrats after after losing to President Trump\nDecided the one who really needed to do was be more off putting they look at President Trump and they see that his popularity rating certain love Oregon I thought well you know what if we could imitate that but you it worse\nRight so he won't have the the kind of blue collar appeal of President Trump we won't have any sort of personal charisma President Trump will just the insanely off putting in terrible all the time maybe that will win a power again\nAnd it doesn't seem like it is working the media are doing their best to try and cover for them so\nYou have this conflict and is now happening in gas lighting that it's happening or Democrats are openly stating\nThat they are in favor of my politics they're fine with my politics they're fine with people showing up at restaurants and yelling at people that are fine when people trying to beat down the thirteenth on bronze doors at the Supreme Court they're fine with folks screaming at Sanders in elevators they're fine with all of these things\nAll these things are just dandy and then you have folks in the media thing Democrats are saying that they're ... it's something that's not real why would you think that the mom says Israel\nAnd those of us in the brain are going well because Democrats said so out loud repeatedly and then the folks in the media and no no no no no you're not allowed to look into what Democrats say the only mobs that exist are Republican mob\nAnd that they will Charlottesville it's a well no that's not a Republican [laughter] what are you even talking about in any case let's begin today with Hillary Rodham Clinton will not go away and she remains on the political scene really torturing everyone Democrat and Republican I'm not sure there are that many Democrats were ordinarily excited about Hillary Clinton still being around\nAgain there there's a basic principle in American politics which is that after you lose the presidential election we really don't want to hear from you\nPretty much ever again Hillary Clinton however does not know this role so she continues to appear in the media and take till they think what you have to love that Hillary Clinton really mean so you have to love about her is that she's utterly transparently mechanical it's like removing the face of o'clock you can see all the gear is working in real time\nSo for example yesterday she was on CNN and she was asked specifically about civility now we all know that Hillary is not the nicest human being and that's that's not a great shock but Hillary was also the person who kept saying during the twenty ... election every time they go low we go high when they go low we go high and that was her routine during the twenty

gay and so you'd be the voice subjects\n\n\nWelcome back to the bench Shapiro shouts out we now have a real gas lighting attempt in fact Democrats openly stating that my politics are okay and then he had suggested that Democrats have said no such thing and there's no such thing as the Democratic mop take for example dominance of Don Lemon last night\nHe had on a GOP commentator and Alex Stewart and she was talking about President Trump who's ripping on the Democratic as an angry mob\nAnd you're in health and get the money and that is so so Alice Stewart said that call themselves a mob which actually accurate pointing to people who are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court people who've rats Senator Cruz and Heidi cruise\nAs well as yelling and Jeff Flake confusing talented elevator and lemon said but that doesn't mean people don't get to object that you're right it's Americans who objected covered in the first amendment it's like the first one\nAnd then Lewis again chimed in and argue the anti cabinet protesters engage them out the hidden in which they get they went into the actual have an authentic hearing room and they screened until they were removed and shouted until they were ... that's called mob beggar okay some lemon said no that's not my behavior it's people who are upset and they're angry with the way the country is doing\nThose two things are not mutually exclusive moms typically are angry and upset with the way country is going\nThe region the media are trying to cover for all this is because the media are beginning to realize that shouting at Republicans not actually the best strategy for winning and so they're simply going to try to convince you that the person who is shouting in your ear is not real like Harvey the bunny\nBunny just imaginary to just over on your imagination\nIt's not a real things up media doing their best to try and tamped down the perception of the public that from is actually correct about all this and the Republicans are right when the cat's Mitch McConnell of course is pushing this for McConnell says listen misbehavior and that Hillary Clinton comments about civility being out of bounds unhinged stuff from the Democrats and then of course it's correct\nNo clues from till I get there was more of his own hands tactics\nApparently this is the love rallying cry\nBut fortunately the American people know that the fact free politics of fear and intimidation or not how we actually ... that are democratic Republican\nWeapons is right I mean the Democrats acting like ... children is not going to help them and that's why the media trying to convince you that not actually what's going on Rand Paul got himself\nIn a little bit of Twitter hot water yesterday or comments he made a that are exactly correct he said that political assassinations could rise in the United states somebody could be killed\nThanks to all of the violent rhetoric on the part of like Hillary Clinton Alison\nI'm somebody go back and listen to condemn it sort of aggressive rhetoric from President Trump and twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen the president in the United states when he was just the cabinet when he was going to rally contain something like punch somebody you don't pay your legal bills when he was doing that sort of stuff like that that's bad the ugly he shouldn't be doing it\nWell Democrats are the ones doing it today and it's just as bad it's just a dad and there'd be more what's it about it too I mean when Hillary Clinton that civility is not required with anybody on the other side of the aisle pretty damning what\nRand Paul fed the sort of stuff is going to get somebody killed and I mean that Hillary Clinton's going to get somebody killed but the rise in temperature is likely to reach a boiling point at some point here ransacked that gets all sort of flat all sorts of flat for it\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and uh that those who are actually up to the the the conversation those were actually saying get in their face ... bears some responsibility of this over to our\nNow people are saying well what about Trump what about okay let's talk about ran for a second as random as one is making the comment Rand Paul had kicked in his ribs broken by a neighbor who allegedly didn't like his politics and literally ... capital him on his property\nRequiring months and months of recovery Rand Paul also happened to be one of the people president at the congressional baseball game where a bunch of Congress people were shot at and eats college was nearly murder\nBut I think that Rand actually does have a certain amount of credibility on this particular issue\nOne of them the direction the country's going is a really ugly direction and it's got to be coming up\nLucian to what ails out just gratitude maybe we ought to take a look at some of the statistic surrounding how good we have it here in the United states I Know you've\nHeard a lot of that now now American infamous gang related to how things really haven't gotten better than Nineteen Ninety I Am the one is your life better than the one thing I mean I really answered probably I Would point why it is my way back\nAll the products are getting better and you're getting them for cheaper\nHere's what they did they divided in Nineteen Seventy nine nominal price has by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal price just by two thousand Fifteen an average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time costs of household items in each year that's the number of hours it would take to buy a washing machine for example so for example\nAnd the time costs may thirteenth Cuban refrigerator fell by ... percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominal wage so if you could buy two refrigerators for the price of one and that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price productions greatly underestimate the totality of welfare again by the average American ignoring qualitative et cetera and environmental improvement on commonly use item again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear and it's pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were in the Nineteen seventies\nWhere are we short or shorten education health care and housing because the costs of those things has written at a faster pace than total compensation however it is true that today's houses\nAre larger and health care is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in practice because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part and major setting the reasoning the housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling said you know in in the country and it's where I live is because of heavy regulation and doughnut\nSo what is the standard of living well it's certainly ... it certainly better than it was in Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in her apartment is bigger the average house the better the average stuff that you have in their house is better\nAll of that should suggest that maybe we should have grateful for the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision\nDemocrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats or Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but if you enraged\nWhen you wake up sleeping giant it's not good for you elect poorly is not good for you\nOkay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth\nIn what they're saying now about justice Kavanaugh but first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my sleep mattress with me there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else he would sleep sleep quick they take two minutes to complete\nAnd use the answers to match your body type and sleep preferences and the perfect mattress\nWhether you're inside sleeper or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from back\nWhen he like there's no doubt saying no more can you can just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes late quit and they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor ... he looks can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals important needs and feel preferences for each side and a ten year warranty and get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five ... oh man France ordered\nThem to a hundred and twenty five bucks off the ceiling fleet dot com slash Shapiro that she would sleep dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I had to deal with sleep mattress we took that sleep politically ordered the mattress that came in the mail is just fantastic so good we got one for my district for her wedding\nGo check it out right now he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the west doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country and that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent know things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rate every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states American pretty safe country for women in fact it's a free at safest country for women in the history of mankind so there's that but\nThere's a song and it's now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook I'm not sure what her name was ... when I got a and she's put up the song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault\nShould not be concerned about it anymore so young men who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should sit down and shop because women have it tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of that which is two things can be for one\nWomen can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of Atlanta why these two things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid\nWhen a man or cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has a right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears onto the equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of the or should be equivalent or that the level of prevalent to these events is equivalent\nBut to say that I shouldn't be afraid of something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now where\nMen are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility so here's the story of James I'm Sorry James I'm going to get into this lady's on so James was a freshman at University of California Davis is just according to region maddening who's on his way to mask\nWas a freshman at University of California Davis is according to region maddening his on his way to math class when he received an email that with rallies life for the next few months\nUniversity title nine office which handled sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating a complaint against him this was in February twenty Eighteen right after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest\nJames and this was not at the time to get accused of something like that the email from the title mind compliance officer when it's in great detail about the jury it's not to James situation you'd be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policy as well as a student code which covers physical assault threats of violence and conduct at Britain's health and safety\nOf finding a responsibility could result in suspension or even expulsion but\nThe email is short on details or the alleged conduct according to the title mind off as a female student and Becky and complains that the James touched her on the bread and butter over and under her clothing without her consent\nJames ... and then classmates and drama and briefly Fred and he gave him a ... who thousand Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone in that storm it catch for a few minutes engaged in some light casual touching for other students interrupted them\nIn James's view encounter had not only been holy consensual it was also mutual that people are just as much responsibility for initiating it as James\nInfected with later make clear to the investigator should also touched him sexually she it was described her own actions in her factual statements\nJames attorney wrote about the incident and uh and just there oh Becky to tell them the incident at set forth in the summer for investigative interviews does not on a stage allege any active prohibited conduct\nOf matter investigation continued until may first at which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James is innocent even so Becky ... afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision consistent with university policy is dictated by the Obama administration's education department\nIt costs James twelve thousand dollars in legal the defending himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she would mutually involved in the sexual conduct\nI mean it's pretty astonishing according to Becky complain\nThe kissing followed a night of mutual floating and started out romantic eventually she either ask them to call it that are close to herself and continue kissing and also touching grinding against each other\nAnd he's still he says my hair started making my ... slowly respectfully testing the waters him to open it got to make sure that he was enjoying what was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes pins remove T shirt and she called them to drop it on the floor so in other words she was involved in every step of all of that\nRight at one point James became too forceful he was running against her she was pressed against the clock the door and Becky asking to be more gentle he agreed and toned down the writing Becky admit that you catch to change his neck but didn't think she gave them ahead ... she did however asking whether he was into certain types of sexual activity\nAnd she said that she was aroused by all of that so she says all of this to the title nine court costs and twelve thousand dollars anyway so should be worried about the sort of so\nWhy not why wouldn't they wouldn't you'll be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminine because women have a completely separate\nSet of here's some of which are justified and some of which are overstated\nMen should not be worried about anything so Brett Kavanaugh was guilty because bad will happen to women and basically the logic of glass and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in that particular point of view well here is that this song from Mercedes Benz expressing our point of view that bad that women are threatened that didn't happen to them therefore mentioned shut up\nHere she had thing about five million use on Twitter installing viral of course\nI Can't\nEven made in nine years old and then it into you know you can go to the moon and can't live in\n... seconds so she can go all the thing all the things you got that she catches you can do I agree that men can be paid and the women are a greater risk of being targeted by men they matter\nBut what does that have to do with the price of tea in China it really has nothing to do with the main topic issue but according to the left something bad happened to me or it could happen to me therefore you should shut up about the possibility of something bad happening to you which is just a line of logic I Do not understand coming up

what happens when a revolution has unleashed on a nation look at Syria how many years has this been going on that was a revolution that was a civil war has not ended yet has it if that's what you want

although people the average person that's sick of it\nAnd ... and the crime is out of control and many that are used to take a look at San Francisco where just the other day a so called homeless bum beat up a young father with his child in a park nothing was done to him nothing human feces in the streets\nNeedles in the streets nothing that people look the other way because the economy is good\nHowever listen to him and carefully when and if\nWe have a blowout and the economy and I believe there is a winning if coming\nThe parallels I've given you between the wimax Republic of the into

mentioned one the other day\n... Rachel Carson's book to Silent Spring in the sixties changed the whole world made us aware of the ecosystems that we're all living in that one book that title alone did it and that was one of many along the way but [noise] um I think that the one that was done by Sinclair Lewis about meat packing let me packing industry\nOr he wrote a book about the horrors of the Florida House that changed things in America and brought about the pure food and drug laws of Nineteen fourteen I Believe books changed society the jungle the jungle thank you\nA single book and change the course of human history\nI'm hoping stop mass hysteria comes along just at the right time but I Am facing such a headwind of a slew of books by people who have television shows\nThat have a round the clock publicity liberals promote their own conservatives do not because of a outright competition they don't want to promote me but you are the audience that can change America's destiny I'm telling you\nAnd you can do so by talking about history but first you have to learn a little bit about it and that little snippet I gave it today is only part of it the rescue me scene and stop a mass hysteria I Want to conclude with this\nIf the economy slows down\nAnd there is a real pain in this country that is when you're gonna see the real right wing backlash\nYou will see it then you say it can happen now\nWell it is happening right now there's an undercurrent right now a real on the current that people have had enough of this filth enough of this filth they can't take it anymore and it came to a head with a capital here in ... when we saw when we saw the destruction of a very decent man\nYou know anyone that went to college and didn't drink but yet we saw what they did to this man\nThey stopped that nothing to destroy him and his family and that I think could be could be the apex of the of the the high watermark of liberalism I think it could be but the real flashpoint will happen when there is a

them now she's saying that we cannot be civil until we have power we are not going to be civil to you we're not going to be civil period until we\nHave power bottom line bottom line and\nThis by the way she's not on the same page as the media who is coordinating a massive push back against the mob narrative\nSo yeah and I have more on that so Heidi Heitkamp she said that she condemned ah Clinton's remarks\nHeitkamp said on Cooper last night I mean I Can't um she said first off she said that it was ridiculous what she had said that what Hillary Clinton had said she said well it's ridiculous uh she said that\nIt that I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides high can't one outputs how she went on to add that she hopes we can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera so\nThat Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting to ah avoid the mob tactic now do you want to know why there's this coordinated effort to push back on the narrative of the mob and it's not a narrative it's just a fact [noise]\nWould you like to know why they're doing that\nI Want to take you back to the president's op ed\nLet me just take you back to this real quick I Want to take you back to the president's op ed in USA Today\nWhere and he discussed Venezuelan style socialism and he also discussed the on civil way that Democrats have been\nUm having discussions on ah the everything every every policy [noise] one of his costs was the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern\nAnd and he said he mentioned that again an adopted but do you remember the speech that he did did you give me this audio he says the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern but do you remember his audio he said you don't hand matches to an arsenic\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become [noise] he said you don't hand matches to an arson it and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become that was the president's quote from his rally the other day\nThat was the president's quote a Sunday night at a rally the day that Kavanaugh or the Senate sorry Saturday Night the data Kavanaugh was a finally confirmed listen\nTo an hour\nHour\nAnd a left wing mom [laughter]\nAnd MSNBC and everybody falling all over themselves to go back against the ... in fact Brooke Baldwin over on scene it wouldn't even say the word mob she literally said the M word adios down by twenty three this is some of that discussion listen\nBecause I Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting shape that are rough cross by a mob oh we're not going to you know the law were totally all it is without\nA doubt that there's no other word\nIt's a quarter of a mob da da da da da da da\nDa and Charlottesville, Virginia to August like oh my God what we saw chains they I don't think we've right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall that\nCivil ... thoughts or about a mom I think he is a way of all\nYeah it's a monitor what she was saying the N word earlier it's the mob\nMob and so they're\nHave to they have to respond to this because this is the way the behavior of Democrats [noise] eh always works against them this is why they lose they they they just blow through their strategy because they they fake it but they can't make it 'cause they can't take it that long\nThe real intent always comes out the door the authoritative disorder carrying tendencies all would come out to try to suppress difference of opinion through force\nYeah Charlottesville was a mob and you know what was the antifa on the left you know what was the Portland protests that we've been seeing you know watch so as the mob of people who went outside a lot of the rallies and we're doing the stuff that they were doing so is that\nThose are mob did you see what happened on the inauguration that was a mob all of it was a mob\nViolence angry hateful mobs people punching people because they were a red hat people ripping hats off of people's heads at malls and restaurants et cetera et cetera people hounding other people in restaurants simply because of a difference of opinion running them down an airport attacking them in their yards\nShooting up a ball field\nArt shooting up a ball field\n\nViolent mobs like behavior\n\nJust insane\nThat that's the idea that they think that and remember these individuals you can't get a Democrat to even condemn antifa that's a good out the vote apparatus\nSo now they want to say well mob\nIs it's well mob the N word I Can't even believe in it but he says that with a straight face\nThe dumbest thing I've ever heard\nI it sounds like twenty five now here's we're seeing and tries to explain to you a mob like scenario\nCalling them a mob is that a bit much\nNo not when you see what they've been doing look I don't think you need to tell me that we want and need to tell those people out there that are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and chasing dinners out of public restaurants and they only had a senator or in in elevators OR Books\nThe Republicans won they knew that that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly two nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that if they spent more time handing out voter registration forms across the country they much more effective\nTo write a lot of people do I mean ... doesn't mean that people get to object for me to write his work and to object [noise]\nFor sure is covered in the first amendment for so long [noise]\nYep sure they certainly government\nCertainly certainly can do that but what what do you thing and and we're seeing it across the country going to a restaurant and screaming at an elected official in a public restaurant\nAnd they did the thing that Sarah Sanders I've done the things that ... many members of the nation because they object with a policy of this president and what ... what the elected officials\nWere elected to do that's not how you go about doing is\nSaying\nWell you mean as calling and the mob that's not accurate I mean people are good to object to I mean it's you know that's not my behavior they're angry with the way the country's ... that's my behavior the first amendment does not include bought scene down people's doors and engaging and violence\nAnd it's my behavior they're trying to justify mob behavior we were not wrong and we said that magazine waters was calling for this show called for it she doubled tripled down on it these are brown shirt tactics in which they want to find individual to disagree with them and screaming shout and bullied them in public\nThe mob that we saw in in in Portland\nThat's not a First Amendment protection you don't get to beat somebody's car with a bat and cost thirty thousand dollars worth of damage that's not your First Amendment\nIt's not your First Amendment to get the records if somebody's children because you don't like the way their daddy voted and threatened to put the records of their children on the Internet\nThat's not that's not a First Amendment privilege it isn't a First Amendment privilege to attack someone in their yard as they're doing yard work and beat them to where they have serious injuries and they're in the hospital with conclusions and\nBroken ribs and pneumonia that's not your First Amendment right either\nJust said this is not your First Amendment right to turn your objection into bullets that you let fly to congressional ball field because you don't like those Republicans that's not your First Amendment right either\nCivility it you can be civil even in the face of hostility but the left got called out and the president was right\nYou don't give ... and you don't give power to an angry lessons ... mob and that's what they become and Democrats just got called out and now everybody everybody\nIs\nPaying attention to the bad behavior of the left and so the left leg got to find a way to get out of it so that's why you've seen this organized push back against\nThe word mob and they

confronted in a restaurant or on the street\nYou actually have tremendous rights to defend yourself\nAnd I'm going to have Dan Horowitz lawyer Supreme on the show to take your calls because I think this is the point where if we're hearing Eric Holder saying the Democrat Party is a part of your text people well you got to know what to do if someone kicks you see that simple Mike\nI'm WABC you have an opinion go ahead please\nHey Mike how are you a long time listener first time caller [noise] um I'm a retired cop in New York said for over Twenty years and believe it or not yeah it's great to have rights I'm the\nCrime is committed against them as aggravated harassment at the lease and you have every right to protect yourself against\nOr let's say let's say a guy and his wife is sitting in a restaurant and the way to what the earrings goals as friends and they come over some harassing them at the table first of all the restaurant is liable for not having kept them out that's number one number two what if they actually start screaming at him and spinning out I'm at the table what can you do\nFor spending is considered an assault [noise] shut that point they can do whatever they have to do to protect themselves\nOkay I always live fire fire when I was a police officer live by a five foot role you can do whatever you want to say whatever you want within five feet or may one boy that five foot rural all bets are off you know at that\nPart so let's say you're out with your wife in a restaurant in New York somewhere queens wherever you are and somehow they know you're an ex cop and they want to harass you and they come screaming you call your names and you say good within five feet to what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what are you do\nThat sort of immediate fear of life at that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's what everybody anybody once you have the fear of life can protect yourself\nAnd this is ... bucks you can protect yourself and do what you have to do to protect life\nWell my my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions you gave me the jury instructions on\nThe right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nReally amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves on what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotized for nation for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said I guess the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down Ferguson, Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime kicking somebody believe it or not Michael is aggravated harassment is a misdemeanor he's already telling\nMe All right

cord marker\nLooming office noise at most or we can't stop that noise but we can call it all the noise around finding the right talent\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use that can lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation\nAnd you know we know if I told you the anger motorcycle people you know we're angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gangbangers now you've got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they're quote protests are ...\nAre there any cases that you tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a ... of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's life for the man knock knock guide on his butt\nAnd my client was and put on trial for knocking the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted him and later on one of them went up and he said you know he was tactically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what is the only one I think\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves yeah for it if there is\nSelf thing yeah you you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger yeah that's it if it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do like shit\nBut what if the guy as I say is over six the and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think that people whose cars were seriously ... particularly the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against trying to stop it in their swarming the car on that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force um was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on his radio show and I will I Will caution everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once that you want to know that person for the rest of your life you know there was do you want to be right as you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years for\nYou can be smart and and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're a train martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you are right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand out and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism [noise]\nYou know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person sided at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets math to mimicking terror groups or ... ... of the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up and\nThat's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow there's no he'd going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics has you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing ... why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he look angry I bet his superiors instruct to him to stand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks because the problem with that approach is that the attackers these rioters cut it anytime\nLose it an attack somebody for somebody getting out of their car or in their car can lose their temper or be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late preemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\nFor Dan what's the bottom line here and let's note Dan how or what you're in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business [noise] ah no it's okay you know you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways I also know that I Know that you've come from a family of of\nOr in some ways I also know that I Know that you've come for a family of of heroes that I Know for a\nFact that I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBoss so proud of his father who was in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches of Normandy to to uh to uh I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle the new\nYes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the bulge and died\nSo damn comes from fighters then does not like to retreat when people threatened him I've seen them in action and the courts\nSo damn I'm gonna ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I have my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and they just friends to come and harassed us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening\nI Would pick up in life and describes it in my hand and up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask from police and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in in the restaurant to join in and protect us included\nI won't do no nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect them not gonna take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me\nFor a while now you know why that is why attorney [noise] you're asking me ... then brings in that into a knife fight\n\nAt all I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question I have a number of people calling on this issue by the way including defense attorneys are on this stuff actually can I grab this call right now while Dan is on the line is there a way to do that you pulled up from a gym\nCan you pull applying for out of ... and re no go ahead pull applied for [noise] yes life for please go ahead quickly\nForget [noise]\nWhat's going on here or have amateur hour here I'll take a quick break while
