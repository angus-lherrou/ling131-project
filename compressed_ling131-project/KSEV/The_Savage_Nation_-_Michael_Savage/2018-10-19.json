has is they're all listening to jazz them for that sort of stuff in a time when we had asked me yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and

dot com slash then there was a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics the article from New York Times is titled why white supremacist are chugging milk and\nWhy geneticists are alarmed and here's what they say it was from any harm and no one on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetic being held in San Diego this week and the topic plaguing many of its members that are occurring appropriation of the fields research in the name of white supremacy\nIn your neck out on political issues is difficult to Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the social issues committee who sought to convene a panel on the racist ... due to genetics and found little traction\nBut the specter of the field cigna miniature past which includes support the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white

bad science and so this has led to some searing conversations between the two of us about political correctness about whether in fact there was an appropriate time to talk about ice to for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and when it\nLike when you talk about biology without being condemned in Texas or raise it he's a real issues that we happen to Scott and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that scientists have contacts\nAnd then use that the Colombian mission minority group and that's basically what this New York times article is about his in region month some scientists have spotted

back\nWell I mean so what they're idiots\nIn one of the great ironies of of white supremacist they're stupid people on the planet\nTo constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb at it as one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority and it really should send your best them in a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetic back in November he warned that research is wrapped in numerous cab yet that are likely to get lost in translation\nBecause people are flaunting get a ancestry test indicating explosively European heritage\nBut the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con downing factor when you look at it from eating racism till they're so take for example racial disparities\nIn education so there's a lot of talking today about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels I was getting into college\nAnd need to ... that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system in alternative wouldn't be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nAnd that is true not just that there are two black and white it's not true production white and Asian white people score lower on the SATs and Asian people do\nA general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to the environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fought question in science but it's interesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example ... is a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome\nAnd we just to the wrong measures to deal with those outcomes genetic is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give materials that people who are suggesting that people some people are in their inherently\nAre inherently worse or more evil or more violent or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't wind up that way but you also have to look at questions of science because you've already scientists\nSo it it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have organized meetings and social scientist in the social implications of the field newest tools David Nelson Baylor College of medicine geneticist who's president of the human genetic society has it will not say completely quite on the issue they said there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology\nWhich is true because racism they moral view and genetic scientific view and scientific racism in the use of science in order to be racist and it's not the use of science in order to pursue good ends\nSo it\nIs here silencing research because you're afraid of how people are going to use that research and I would suggest that you're using science and we need to have some very hard conversations about actual science actual problems in actual solutions without falling prey to the idea that because that people are going to use the information we have to watch the information it's OK\nComing off of any of that person now say that

reverse IQ to admit people dumber you are the better off you are\nOr you have to understand the purpose of affirmative action and leave quotas they're the true purpose is to make sure that [noise]\nOf affirmative action and these quotas they're the true purpose is to make sure that a white liberals maintain that at least a plurality but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have to have the numbers\nThat we will reach a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard\nAnd end up like Cal Tech in Berkeley for basically they're dominated by Asians and not because Asians um have necessarily the best of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're the majority anymore [noise]\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nThere is discrimination against their shoes for what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have bought the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed by whites there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans actually at points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the the the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nA higher than higher than any of the race that's a that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal\nDo not fall into the minority then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California white people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are ... predominantly Asian\nSame with the colleges so Harvard Yale and Sam\nIf you're white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go where the public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi and fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kittens if they go to school for rank as I should say we'll go to private white high schools\nIn other words it doesn't apply to her for\nIraq so\nWhat what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be a son in law applies equally for all races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a lot of points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it is done today and we have to let\nThe urine admissions consulting so let's look at Harvard for example or yellow prince and the same thing applies to all of these schools\nHave subjects that are extremely difficult that you can't say whether it be astrophysics for organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted with these rigs scores are able to compete in those classes\nAnd they all have they don't major in physics for electrical engineering\nSo what you know kids who are admitted under these weeks than as one of the major in\nTheir major in anything with the word studies after that so it was ... or\n... ... that's funny you let me hear the studies the examples of what they major and\nI even environmental science which is a bogus science\nYes of course that's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into and it's not a science social studies going through a metal or is if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard for the electrons in Portland at MIT and what do you see it's all Asia the white people don't want to go there anymore\nWhat wait a minute this all Asians because whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nFor their intimidate they get wondering what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about they aren't committed by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut you're actually saying the white kittens are afraid to go to Harvard now\nOr the yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they follow the party line\nI don't know where you're coming from actually starting to be willing to me now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like it was that there are academic get ... academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the stem feels feels where they dominated by the the lesser students go away towards away from them because\nYou're you're not in ... you're not implying that there are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are\nMany fewer or because they are many of them are intimidated by\nThe way we're white kid will train a apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering where we apply\nApply to MIT they can apply to Cal Tech for even Berkeley right foot\nAnd they and they don't have the same you'd admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not ... ...\nActually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they said that the standard for everyone by faith they planted\nIn the same they set the standard for racism now ... knew that the new distinction\nCorrect they they are they penalize Asians and everyone else followed them because they didn't want to reach that tipping point for the student body becomes majority age when that happens then all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there\nI I have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on so many Asians because they are good students they study are they come from families the push them very hard the whole tiger mother thing background has won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you don't want to say that people\nI don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian it wouldn't matter to me if they all got an based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan back when he was governor California [noise] basically go to Berkeley saying what you see you see hardly any white students correct\nI haven't been there in twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay okay\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing joined me there it's kind of sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there and it's heartbreaking to go there the last night I went there and looked like a male stream of insanity all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably gonna wind for the court system for many years and of course Harvard and all the uh didn't leave a paper trail life and they were they were given carte blanche to do this by the ...\nDecision back in Nineteen Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor alone have explicit quota but didn't they didn't write the quota down they just put it in their heads and say okay every time we get an Asian students to crack on every time we have a black Hispanic Native American\nIn your opinion as a society benefitted\nBenefitted from affirmative action not at all\nBecause when you look at for example at the top two universities see the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rate than whites and the Asians and they don't tend\nTo what about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\nYes of course it's been calculated for example the acceptance rates by race so the acceptance rates race race by race\nRace by race so the acceptance rates race race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate of an an Asian students [noise]\nFor example and a static students of earthly has tripled the acceptance rate for the white students with the exact same statistic [noise]\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who is working hard to be knocked out because of the way you ... you look at your race it's horrible\nAnd I and it's the opposite of what our U.S

I\nSeriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that get real\nTo my knowledge I don't even ... even knows James's crew now there are people in the jury who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hotbed for activism [noise] um but I think that was before Holly even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said she lied again and she desperate to\nBeen this says oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump or if the house and Senate\nSomehow change hands to Democrats and we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her staffer they have to get over it and her staffer said well she you know support ... of a ban on semi automatic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't seen anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she ... she supports an assault weapons ban\nThey hear the difference she kinda got caught\nBecause when you're talking about an assault weapon ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left use that as the term coming all them item addict rifles but they know that stain or semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you so they don't say all semi automatic rifles they say assault weapons\nSo as to to suggest that they actually only support banning just a couple of kinds of some item addict rifles but that's really it\nBut that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I had them easily pulled out the two thousand and twelve or all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime report which was the last\nCollection available and they'll have others coming up I think there's one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there is nothing for twenty Eighteen yet but the two thousand twelve and twenty sixteen report\nWhen you look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are\nA suicide et cetera or the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe the automobile accidents are hands feet and says those are two and three times a deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons\nAnd that's according to the FBI on statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report duty ours twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nShe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and get a gold but the bottom line is that it's it's not even it's it there's so many\nThings that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want it they they they they assault weapons they don't want to take them out some automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go on for some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and they just going to go after whatever else was left and that's the goal it's incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms\nSo when she gets out there and she says that you know you have a foreign thought weapons and okay so some automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that well\nWhat what are you what do you what conclusion do you come to win a politician will not publically say no that's not sure I don't do that and they're just quite from it and they run and hide from it what conclusion do you usually drop Ken what do you usually think about an issue where a politician act like that what we would have been a little disingenuous sounds like they support it\nDoesn't it yeah yeah I'm trying to make you believe otherwise yeah exactly that's exactly it\nAnd so she knows very well that how silly it was that she's sitting here accusing Josh Hawley\nIt's just silly\nAnd we've asked her on this program numerous times um I've always been incredibly civil but I'm I'm going to disagree with you and I'm going to question you she looks at that as an active and civility which is why at one press conference I asked her question and she began screaming at me\nShe was yelling at me\nIn front of all of this media she was yelling at me she falsely accused me of working on her opponent's campaign and all of this stuff and I'm like I've never ever worked on a campaign\nEver I have never worked on a campaign\nEver\nNow I'll support issues never worked on a campaign not since I was in college and it was for a Bill Clinton and I was just a little lowly volunteer don't hold it against me it was his his his reelection but yeah so um that's you know it it was\nSilly for her to say that the the thing is though is the press in Missouri seriously it's always been kind of weird but they've got to I think it's it's media malpractice from Missouri press and I ask her where and and because isn't that the whole purpose of media\nI mean you are supposed to\nYour ear you're supposed to get information and share it with people\nRight I mean she was asked about you know this stuff and it looks like\nI mean she was asked about you know the stuffing it looks like she's really really are trying to hide her\nHer full I'm really trying to hide what her positions are for moderate voters\nNow the Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nShow mhm\nThat's in a bait that send a debate is uh from what I understand this evening now she has already demanded that there be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she\nSays okay so what do you mean fraud when the hell was fraudulent because if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud\nThe frog seems is I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you trying to have it both ways\nAnd a video showing where are you truly than how was the video showing the truth fraud I I Would love for that to be defined please define that where that fraud\nYeah\nSo I you know hopefully that I Would love to see that as a question most so many moderator Chuck though I don't know who's modernity tonight but I'll find out\nUh the some of them
