was lacking\nI didn't agree with it in fact I think it's you almost useless material that I'll get into why the minute that's a whole subject the other subject was that the guy didn't look the

this guy video about how\nWe should set goals should be on the goals should be said that a realistic and are those are too many goals what time of the road to search for the whole thing apart but let's take one step further so we really make this point at this point across that is\nWhat if you would set goals by will be people your whole life and that's pretty much most people are society not everybody\nBut some percentage will say fifty percent of people are less or the the successful help for society by the very nature of that number less than fifty percent of the people are\nHalf the successful is the other people right so what do you want to go up to argue and apes center you know so you said goals to be as much as an eighty percent of our society or eighty five percent or maybe we're eighty seven forty six percent of our society of success\nEighty five percent or maybe we're at eighty seven forty six percent are by society of success and you set those goals and very early age your parents talk to you about them your pasture your teachers your coaches they all said you should try to succeed to some level\nAs you said some basic goals and what's interesting as you went out and accomplish them you know you had the goal to get to college and you did you have to go to get a job and you did you had a goal to get married and you had a goal to have children and you did\nYou had a goal to put some money and four one K. and you did\nAnd had a goal to retire but at the time you were sixty five and you did so what you've done as you've been completely successful used that small realistic goals\nNot too broad because here you are now let's look at you go back to look with those goals have done for you because they work a lot of goals you will need a few and you hit those\nThey worked unrealistic they're all very realistic you accomplished\nLet's go back and talk about life really was you got a job you didn't really like the job you didn't make that much money\nAnd it for short sighted just to have a job in making any amount of money it was fine\nYou slowly progress through the ranks over forty years and you went from the low end of the totem pole

really enjoy going places together vacations are just going out for dinner\nBut as life went on and the kids arrived those dinners went away date night went away travel went away\nEven when you did travel or go out to eat we had to take care of the screaming kids and you had to make sure the kids got that I Know this because I I go out with normal people\nWe've got family members they go out and we have to take their kids with it it it's just miserable I don't care what you say you love your kids I'm not saying you don't love your kids I'm seeing you hey when they're screaming in the middle of the restaurant\nYou hate when they won't eat the food there's supposed to be you don't enjoy all that stuff I don't care what you say no one would be enough but no you have two or three\nBecause you had one was a girl and you wanted a boy she tried to get another girl she tried getting if I get a boy and you quit\n[noise]\nSo now your wife is just miserable with taking care of other people's

professional [noise]\nBooks like less of a limited real estate investor radio show [noise]\nHow do you do if you're doing if you're successful and you're investing well what are the things I Do my seminars I ask people to add up all their network\nAnd that will include your net value of your home\nThat value of all your rental properties or who who you're four one K. rye or raise your savings accounts of your annuities everything you have that at all or\nMost people don't even know what their network does it'll tracking the network is number one thing you need to know about yourself because after scorecard where you at like\n... what to do is I Want you to track your income your passive income income to make whether you get up and go to work or not so I had to add up all of their like two thousand Seventeen passive income which would be royalties interest income edited income that they actually got paid dividends got paid um\n[noise] uh see what else would be\nPassed income new these income can be passed income it's really it's the income the or having an investment something so when you look at things like your four one K. your four one K. is not passive income the money is in there because you worked and your boss gave you more money in there if they match because you worked\nAt the same thing will retire ... retired a retirement account pension plan is just a bird income or from working in other words that are given the everything you're worth right now we're going to give you some when you retire et cetera et cetera so you take all of your passive income that at all up and figure out what that is\nAnd most cases surprisingly little\nAnd then you divide that by your network and what you'll find is that Ninety percent of the people in the room\nHave a return on net assets of less than one percent\nMany habitat the books at a hundred a ... even the thousands of a percent\nReturn on net assets now do you ever expect to get rich how do you ever expect to retire if you're not or anything with your money\nThat's the secret so what is the secret to becoming wealthy what is it that we do a lifestyle is what we do is we teach people to maximize the return on their assets that's what it takes right you've got to maximize the return on your assets\nSo when we look at this thing\nThe next set of people have money's invested in something that makes money right\nSome people some stuff that makes the money so those people generally have a return of anywhere from one percent too much as much as five maybe even six percent\nAnd that's a very very high percentage ready to retire when you realize or not because if you're earning less than one and somebody who earns too that's over a hundred percent better than you're doing right if they were six that's over five hundred percent better than you're doing five hundred percent better than you\nRight but it's still low I mean\nYou think you should have returns like if you're on the radio all the time for most people bringing people either made a hundred percent return or ... three hundred percent a casual as a ten twenty thirty per se cash flow\nWhy is it even those people only end up with a six percent return and the reason is they've only got a small portion of their total network invested\nThey have what we call dead equity all over the place and that that equity isn't earning you any money and because it's not earning you any money he's bringing you're ready to return on the overall portfolio down\nNumber one killer your personal home if you paid off your personal home\nNumber one killer your personal\nIf you paid off your personal home that is the dumbest thing you could possibly do there's only one reason that you're home should be painful and that's because you've already got so much dust that property that are in you as much more than you want\nSo you can retire doing nothing that you don't need the money you pay the hell's off because you don't really need the rest of that money to be earning you anybody\nBut if you are not now earning enough money to live off of happily live off of retired then that money sitting there wasting away doing nothing for you you still have to pay the taxes you still have to pay the insurance you still have to pay for maintenance and repair\nIts waste as it could be earning money\nRentals where the guy the other day I lied rental properties on the radio just yesterday I wrote a problems he's said he was making hundreds of ... percent return on these deals yet when we calculated it out it came out to six percent return\nGoes making tons of money but it was only six percent of his net worth\nKnow what he thought it was was twenty six percent because only counting the money that he actually invested not the way that accrued and these properties\nRaul where nothing four one K. Beijing nothing it back you pay a higher rate nothing none of these things are putting money in your pocket each month\nThink about that that's the see the short break we'll be right back lifestyles unlimited real safe [noise]\n\n\nYour home dream her conservative talk radio cancer you leave several hundred am voice from Texas\n\nWe know you're out there hiding in plain sight living a life of why a desperation wondering if you're going to be money for the great there's a federal way of federal wife lifestyles unlimited signs of liberal white deserve you can only do that by creating passive income\nLetters show you how just fewer hours to give you more than another meeting of house meetings or another my mom made fun of the TV shows do you why you know you why in ...\nWhen it's time to replace it with some people put it off and killing Americans theorized\nThis is that the hottest has raising your you didn't really think I understand people county it's way too complicated to extend\nOur customers television they wish they would have done it so I hear it all the time once the rivers are fights they wonder why they waited Caroline because it's really not that complicated would show up on time we cut you off ... place most movies then gets one day it has anything we take pride in making a process even\nThe clean up is phenomenal people always comments that it looks like we were never there and now those customers sleep better at night knowing your new roof has meant itself correctly\nWhen you know you need a new with don't put it off and county now that the hot and chaos within a three to four and I think for for say\nEstimates their brain hate three to four nine six four four things when you need moving repairs and new roof or remodeling college the chaos and I think eight three to four unarmed fix for forcing\nUS Marshal\nListening to gay anti anytime anywhere\nMost data no boundaries known him for a larger point or the iPhone app store search KFC the select few the out party than it only takes a couple of minutes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "03"}
