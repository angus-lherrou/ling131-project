life\nYou know I think in the beginning you're grinding really really hard in your twenties and your thirties or you're you're you're a different you're in a different states you know so um I think these days\nMy balance I get it has to do with my children first and making sure that that I'm there for them and you know I read the coverage private conversations I'm not going to share it with water yesterday and it was so great to hear that had a conversation with him right but at the same time I you know I also have a responsibility to myself\nAnd and and who you know the kind of that I
