have to see it in my mind to know how to fix and that's true I I Do the same thing I don't close my eyes like he did but I still when I'm Talking I can visualize what we're looking at even just like we do on the radio I can see what the callers are talking about\nWe're going to hear skaters voice today throughout the program a skier will do in the commercial breaks he'll do those\nCommercials that he would normally do we didn't want to depart from that today we want it to maintain that and our goal for future programs is to make sure that there's a a little bit of Skeeter in every program

business we were doing with his boat called business for a video out fishing on that boat so there was a hero business taking care of business so\nSome people would sit there and think ah you know a

boat business and he goes you know I Want to do that and he goes you know when people call in and ask for Skeeter\nThey're gonna you know actually say that on business\nI Try and that's why one of the name of that is right it is that in\nAnd he was all it was you know whenever you whiskey or when you were with Skeeter\nHe was not about Skeeter it was never about fear it was a he was about you and whoever was in front of me every time a it was amazing to be around them in like that and\nI learned a lot from me uh Fifteen sixteen almost sixteen years of being around him again as supposedly a business partner but we were not where we were\nGood friends did you ever doubt how few Skeeter felt about you\nNever never did he was just the uh he just loved to people he would show that seventies

base and it might be a very short topic or something we could have talked about in ten or Fifteen minutes or so but I Would tell my wife she say ah where are you going I'm going to go talk to Skeeter\nAnd um the about this and this and she goes well that won't take long then I go no I'm going to be there a while 'cause I Know that it's going to be an hour or an hour and a half maybe of of just conversation about life as you say and then we'll get around to the business\nMaybe might take a couple of visits to work for a business out but what a great conversation was and and uh and I know you don't walk up and you never look at your watch while you're talking to Skeeter it's uh it's always a great conversation\nAnd they were doing it and that brings up a story that I thought of
