because they don't show six thirty nine on the leader on conservative talk radio am several hundred K. has revealed by\nJuly cells are limited recess or just shows that they were discussing how I see the market has changed and\nWhy I think that the way the economists even though they're getting the numbers right are getting their predictions wrong simply because they're looking at old statistics compared to today statistics which makes absolutely no sense to look at because the curves are not the same if you look at a curve\nThe size of the curb the larger it is the ... the lives it's simple that you make that circle larger and those curves are smaller they're they're less pronounced to the point where you get as large as the earth and you can't even see there's a curve\nAnd so what I'm saying that we used to buy houses for ten thousand twenty or twenty five thousand dollars apiece and now they're three hundred thousand two hundred and fifty median three hundred and thirty one thousand average\nThat curve it's changed those look into demand remember their supply and demand their buying power and there's desire to buy\nTo look at housing supply there was no supplies there's only a three month supply of houses to be purchased out there for somebody wants to buy homes now you're more than the little mom and pop you got you got married maybe have a baby you're Thirty Years'

think so those are not entry level homes what's even worse is the new construction that's being built is over three hundred thousand dollars a door on the average\nAnd so if you want a new home that's almost impossible that's out of range\nThe median income in our country doesn't even come close to support the median price of a whole not even close couldn't even in your dreams if you had a median price income job support a median price all\nSo that is going to drive people to the bar but so that's making the apartment business become better\nAnd the housing business less now we go out there and we buy stop at a price it's really a steal it two hundred and forty\nForty two hundred and forty a jak number two forty eight is the median price and we're buying stuff with a hundred thousand dollars a door which we are we're buying it less than fifty cents on the dollar the median price\nWe put ten twenty thousand dollars in it were one ten one twenty would still less than fifty percent of the median price and it says were less than fifty percent of the median price we can charge a rent that's less of what it costs to buy the house and still make a profit\nThat's a crazy situation so we as investors are buying up all of the low end houses that homeowners would like to have but they can't get too because they don't have the wherewithal the understanding of the market to buy instantly even if you have to you know to boot\nThey're sitting there thinking and looking and thinking looking every time they turn around and investors bought it right out from underneath them\nOr they have to buy back from the investor after you invest your body renovated now selling it for full market products\nThere's no deal for entry level people write so as interest rates start to get
