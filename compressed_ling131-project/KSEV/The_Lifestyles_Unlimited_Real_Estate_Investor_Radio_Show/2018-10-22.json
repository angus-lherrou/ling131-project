five\nAnd now after many many many different types of physical ailments\nAre injuries and so for the sixty two years of age I feel like more energy than I've ever had before well as much energy is everywhere I could always had a lot of energy and um you know a back to a situation where\nIt's a new season of my life I just realized that it's coming out of the hospital this week I'm with Richard to light is the director Caroline is whatever [noise]\nUm [noise] I realize that okay you know there's I'm at that age I'm no longer going to be a body builder anymore I'm no longer going to be a power lifter\nAre no longer going to have a perfect body I Can't work out the way I used to work out so forth but I can stay in shape I can be physically fit uh all the things that have gone wrong with all of my body because of the you know having cancer and take a radiation uh you know they they take care of all that\nYou know having cancer and take a radiation uh you know they they take care of all that medication\nAnd the point I'm making is nothing about all the physical stuff it's it's the seasonal thing was that went into the hospitals last time was because I stopped drinking three or four weeks ago and I started eating stuff it messed with my ... a director to either\nAnd I ended up getting a whole mind testing which they had to go in and fix took me about six days I've still got to come and go to my stomach which is no fun get it out tomorrow but the reality is is that\nWhat really does does it make you realize okay you know they say if you ever have something wrong like cancer cancer never really even bothered me um\nThis thing today or this week or last week or whatever it was it it it didn't bother me what it did was realize along with the fact that I'd stop drinking or it cleared up my mind and said look you're in a different part of your life you got to do something different now\nRight and so I went through the seasons and my wife and I bought these small apartments that are made tons of money that I bought medium size apartment so I made even more money and did and I really acquitted medium sized departments into somebody else's life sales cable I've started by and large apartment lots of them making lots of money so I realized\nThat I have stagnated you know I got to the point where I was the highest level people that were around me financially\nAnd then people were trying to go past that they were passing me up at it and it was not like it was just I'm an ego challenge saying it was like it was almost an insult mentally like you're teaching these people to do things you know how to do that you won't do why why it'd be stepped away\nFrom the competitive world of self\nOf being more do more accomplished more\nWhat are you going to give back to society are you going to leave your legacy in the gutter where they could be at the top of the mountains where you know it and I started thinking about all that so I made a plan they started a new level in my life\nI'm a new season per se that I went out and I realize that the limitation was I didn't want to work hard anymore making more money by ten times of ever dreamed of making I didn't want to work hard anymore I did want to work and I did want to work smart but not hard\nI set up all my business as to where I did very little in them\nAnd I didn't want to do a lot again so what I did was\nI went up like a lot of rich waves vice president of the second largest company in the country and our talk them into coming here and that I Would buy ended up real estate to

now 'cause now I've got a new goal now got a gold with eight years of age well go set a high bar for me to have to follow\nAnd I'm thinking to myself\nBut that's a lot of seasons man we're in my sixties right now or the ending a season getting ready to go into it and actually in a new season\nOf my life uh right now\nAnd um what came about it I wouldn't tell you that I came to the end of all these deals with John and I did all the apartments that or do the bullets to manage and excited to get rid of them all at one time what I Want to do was I wanted a new season of my life where I was in class a apartment complexes that was going to be my new business\nAnd a wide look because I've never done it because it was the highest level of competency as far as okay\nThere you are buying the most expensive assets in the marketplace I'm\nThinking that that would elevate\nThe recognition of lifestyles being that once I start buying class Asian people see they make sense that they can be purchased in in a way to make some money than other people want to do it at that point we're right now dominate the classy it'd be market\nAnd all the cities were him and we're starting to do that all over the country was started by everywhere\nBut if I can start by class at barber complex was then a new season erupts for lifestyles are limited also everybody or want to do it either how do I know that because when I bought sees everybody wanted to buy 'em\nRight when I bought big ones even more people wanting to buy but just it just whatever that people can see can see and believe they can achieve and so leaders go places no one's ever gone before it sent back nap so this is my\nNew season of my life is to try to do this but how do they get the money to go out there by classy apartment complexes cause I'm not buying them syndicated by myself and I'm doing that because no one else in lifestyles could afford to buy a classy by themselves I Want you to understand that\nI'm doing it because no one else can do it they can syndicate up to buy a classy and bringing a hundred people's money by one\nBut no one else could afford to buy it by themselves\nThat what does it do that proves that it's a world where you can live at that the rest of the wives tales members that are following along and growing rapidly becoming very wealthy some day we'll be able to old one apartment complex and fifty thousand dollars a month\nTax free\nThey think about that could you go by one property and make fifty grand a month after ...\nThat's the difference in your life that's a major difference in your life so\nTo do that though I had to liquidate everything else and so the properties John and I bought a two hundred and fifty six you probably don't tell you that surprise you\nAnd so the properties John I bought a two hundred and fifty six year probably I don't tell you the sort of pressure you but to impress upon you received release numbers think about what you're doing with your money and realized how an impressive it is John and I bought a proper two hundred fifty six years for four point eight million I'm rounding that down [noise]\nUh and uh we sold it for seven point six million right so there's a three million dollar difference\nUh we bought another proper two hundred Seventy you're part of a complex bought it for three four five million we sold it for like four four million so there was a six million dollar difference that's nine million altogether\nBut another property Bruce was good boy you're way we bought a three hundred twenty your property for two point
