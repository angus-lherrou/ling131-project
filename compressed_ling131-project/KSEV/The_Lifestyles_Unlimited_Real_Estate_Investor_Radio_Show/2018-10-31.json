destruction\nAnd decide what I can do what I Can't do the first thing I did was I figured out the biggest most problematic things that we're going to destroy the house or me the worst and stop the bleeding so I had to get the garage doors painted the expensive front doors painting 'cause it will be destroyed\nA and the back doors painted so the first thing was to stop the bleeding you've got to

blowing them over had cleaned the pond out at the same time I had broken falling through the bridge broken the bridge and saw the bridges rotted out multiple places broke my leg ... so now I Can't fix the bridge because of al for a long period of time\nPhysically so the bridges are I think about bringing somebody and everybody I talk about they don't want to project because it's either too small

rocket rotted out that's how I knew I had already had to get somebody to fix\nThe leak and then as you get somebody to fix the sheet rock um\nYou get to the idea what I'm saying to you is this stuff does not\nHappen in a vacuum\nLife is everything thrown at you at the same time\nAnd you have to constantly have a plan with priorities sometimes somebody gets thrown into the play I liked it today I
