probably saying the same things I'm saying\nAnd that just isn't going to get me anywhere so I got to look for people that have four or five times and worth I Do minimum\nAnd look to them as you say what are they doing differently how do they see the world differently now what are the things I'll tell you is is that successful people are constantly learning\nAnd growing and every time you read a

back of your life on the limited will say a radio show so this is\nWhat you invest in clean 'em in the middle class people up there too [noise]\nAnd I'm Wondering you know the concept that I'm wealthy people in a in a way that compounds there will massively and they also take and generations they don't think in a in buckets are pockets or whatever or let's start with the first one the pocket thing\nMiddle class the poor people think of money or ... or ... or there's actually some idiots out there they call it pockets of money and they think like renaming your money in different pockets that it makes a difference to you it doesn't make a difference you have X amount of money or you don't have X amount of money\nPutting money in a bucket gone to college for another bucket call your four one K. and then the buckle and I read the book garlic your emergency fund doesn't change the amount of money you have\nIn fact when it does it does lessen the possibility of using that money for anything effective wealthy people look at the total opposite base\nAnd decide whether or not that as a base can produce more income or not they don't worry\nAbout saving for retirement because they know they're going to be so wealthy by retirement because of income that they're not going to have to have a savings account for retirement\nThey're not worried about little village college fund because they took over buildings college for the bottom of the part of a complex with it and now that we'll fun little Billy go into college and\nWhen village on a college will give him income for the rest of his life\nSo why would you want to buy or save money to pay for college to get a guy out to have to get a job or the rest of his life when you live in an apartment complex which will pay for college and the day for him for the rest of his life rich people think differently the poor people like\nWe look at every asset we have all of our assets overcast for weeks like what can we do to maximize returns on all of our network you know sometimes we have like all the cash and a lot of liquid cash on that right now because I sold off a department complex\nThat it that cash or any next to nothing it's it you know somewhere between one and two percent interest\nOr is out there right now actually ties to the court per se but the reality is that's nothing I'm looking you buy an apartment complex right now I'm In the process of it this this apartment complex for early you know somewhere between fifty thousand probably about fifty thousand dollars a month\nAnd we'll just six hundred thousand dollars a year\nBut it will also do more than that it will allow that income tax free whereas the interest income on that money would be taxable income is not going to be actual detach and an addiction that I was going to give me an additional three hundred thousand dollars with the right off\nOf depreciation that I could write up against other\nIncome now that that the new tax laws will probably give you another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars with the elections I could write off so I look at that like while I'm getting out of earning two percent they'll go earn ten percent\nTax free to say taxable earn ten percent tax free\nWere not counted whether or not I'm going to have the capital gains I'm not looking forward to capitalize on that looking at appreciation I'm just looking at current income tax deducted ability of that income along with access tax deductions\nAnd you can see that it will make a major difference in my personal income portfolio\nAdd this apartment complex you know my goal is purchased for property this year so far there should be the property I intend to next year by probably another four or five properties get much\nAnd Ken to next year by probably another four or five properties get myself back up to eight or ten properties that's where I'm comfortable about eight or ten property guy at like quarter change could at forty properties I Can't even\nYou know I have to get excited about that to do that maybe now that are drinking maybe I can get excited about only forty properties but hey ... properties and\nArgue it's women into do swimming in the tax write offs life is good and what are the other things that I Do the soldier for the Curtis is that\nSome of the properties are by by the by myself so instead of rolling ten or twenty percent like hurts my old public property I own a hundred percent of it so if you own forte properties in your own\nA temper set a forty year old the old really for property she oh twenty percent of forty ... eight properties so don't think of it being that far different the two things we're doing I just happened to prefer to have total ownership my properties total control\nOr as opposed to being out there and owning other properties with other people\nBoth of them were don't get me wrong I Do have some passive deals both of them work I'm not against them for them but that's just my personality my preference or whatever but the bottom line is\n... like the same way about one thing that ... has got to get invested ... not hurting what it should be already
