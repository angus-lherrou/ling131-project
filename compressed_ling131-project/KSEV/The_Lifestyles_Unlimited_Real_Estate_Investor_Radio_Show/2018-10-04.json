ask what was the epiphany what did you what light bulb went on your heads at a ... that's what I needed that's what I didn't have shared with is your your big epiphany from this today\nI'm probably not one to probably two big light bulbs that went off then and then we came to the uh the today\nYou know for all our goal was to replace our expenses or was this retirement thing that we're talking about where\nYou know at some point and and me having a career and I you know I I didn't know about like all three or you know the Bible among dogs but yeah it was all about you know figuring out how I'm going to replace the income that was paying\nYou know figuring out how I'm going to\nReplace the income that was paying for the expense of them certainly whatever we want it to do going forward in life\nAnd so uh the cost of the path of income was incredible ... and it is something that I had never heard of that so that today um the idea of putting your money or or you an investment that it's just passively providing you with distribution\nAnd um that was\nThat in itself was day that that was huge though that for us with what we're looking for especially with real estate was this idea that we could make a small investment and they get back a distribution without really putting now working to it I think the second one which was\nPerhaps much much bigger I'm an unexpected a or a ... he especially was not retirement\nI'm at a cell is not an age you know and and I was working towards my plan of fifty years and I as an engineer by spreadsheet my numbers that I knew where I needed to be and how much I Need to say that ... that were on or whether or not we're going to hit [noise] you know some magic number before the age of it because then\nYou know you came in with this idea that the real the retirement is not an age that point in which your passive income\nHas replaced or exceeded your bosses and that was it I mean I was I was done I was ... old men helped me figure out how I could make this thing happened and um\nAnd uh those those are the two big ones those are the two big ones there's this whole idea of me just coming in for the past and then come not even the retirement um and then realizing hey I could make this happen a lot sooner than my plan with big that was real big\nYeah those are those really big one and like I told you before it always\nFeels like to me that I don't get that across\nStrong enough because most people feel like their retirement is the end of their life and that from that point everything goes downhill\nOr you know you're gonna make less money you're going to live off of whatever you have left over your health is going to get you know go downhill you'd have less less less less notoriety popularity you know success\nAnd there's just sort of like an existence where's\nThe reality is in our lives especially retirement was the beginning it was an opportunity for the first time in your life and not enough to get up and go put in you know six eight ten twelve hours a day for five six seven days a week and just be a part of the grind to where you can now step back and think and I remember\nThinking to myself when I first retired at thirty four years old but\nWow for the first time ever if I get a great idea I have something I Want to go do I can go do it and I ended up making more money than what I made working because I had the time to go do something that was incredible and the second thing that\nI don't think I get across swelled up is that every year since I retired I've made more money\nEvery year have more passive income\nI Love all basically the same amount yeah allow my fiance to spend a lot of money though but without her I Would spend nothing and I make more every year 'cause I took what I Do spend and put it investments and make even more for more investments so every year since I retired\nI've now you know made more money and I think people think that isn't the way it happened as you get poorer and poor or with the traditional way of eating away at your savings their life savings to live off of it\nAnd that those things are just not true\nI also want to add with back this point let you pick it up and carry it and that is the time what do you think about the day you quit your job and having the time and we're going to go to a break on this for this is the big question but do you think about that the day you gave viewer notice you now had your life\nThrough just to make decisions you'd never made before like what time I got to get up what how many of my day with my daughters with my wife would might just go look for a new business to start something new\nIt's an incredible concept to have your life back in your hands most people don't know what they're doing themselves

helping other people would have you thought about so far as to be new mid to what are you thinking you would bring to the table for all these people that need you so much\nI think um I I I've actually been thinking about that quite a bit you know kind of mild process than all kind of what I've gone through my own path over the last almost almost five years which\nIs just incredible thinking about it how fast we been able to move and you know the last last five years versus the lot Eighteen I added in corporate America ... day I done more made more in the last five years than I Am in a year\nIn corporate America at the same company and and and and getting paid well too um\nBut I I Would I I really look for it to\nBe able to help other people in that same kind of scenario being able to put a plan together to figure out hey I'm I'm into W too uncomfortable\nYou know I I had a good life right I don't I don't know that I don't have a great loss but they're just don't know by the time to do and by the job that I keep investing and I need to invest more lifestyle\nYou know true lifestyles in love with it and and then that education but I Would I I look forward to helping people created

spend more time with their family to go on vacation I was a good time to do the things that they wanted to to um to enjoy life a little bit more than maybe they are now but I'm too old to make that transition from W tutu or to real estate it's it's one that I Know from experience is\nNot an easy one um I I I think sometimes financially it's easier than it is mentally because we we come from the\nYou know the background of you know I have to go to school to get a job after work and say that I'm doing anything out of that I have I completely uncomfortable but some things are something that right here is we're all I'm not supposed to leave a good job you know\nBut I did that I mean I Love it really really good job voluntarily and I am doing much better than I ever thought was possible you know on the other side and um\nBut having the opportunity to help people kind of go through that same process that I look forward to as a as a mentor now like an elderly people create that same lifestyle for themselves\nWill you know of as I told you last segment the uh the thing that I looked at people pours mentors degrade themselves basically a water to things we grade waters how many people have you retire to be totally changed your life that's\nThat you that your little black book could start to write those down Everytime you help somebody you see the chains are like that take note that mentally because you're going to turn around one day it's going to be hundreds of people\nAnd you're going to walk into a Starbucks and some of his girl hey there's Kevin he changed my life it's weird how it happened so quickly that all of a sudden you're known all over the place even when you out of the state because our mentors or our members were everywhere and if you're going to be\nThat tore actually you're going to walk into a you know some room somewhere and another city and there'll be an inventor there'll be fifty a hundred people good at all do who you are for you walk

we've turned it around to wear lifestyles for twenty seven years has breached excellence in the industry so I think that's the other one I think it's important but I Will share with you this\nAnd I joked about it last year your entrance interview that I really believe this to be true there are three types of mentors at bay at one of them is the no mentor who tells you that everything you try to do\nIs wrong doesn't make sense and the know mentors facing his guards have done this I'll never make a bad decision by say no to everything\nRight because if I say no they'll never fail and all that rubber failure on my resume the second one is the guy the guy who can say no even when you look at that then you go there's absolutely no way you should do that I've got to tell you don't do that this is crazy please don't do this\nAnd yet there's some guys you can't do that they're just okay we're music that's what you should do you pick it up\nThe third one is\nOh gosh I'll pick this up for back
