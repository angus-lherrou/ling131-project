Medicare Medicaid patients veterans who work with a VA very closely so any any service since you might need our home please call us a tour I'd want seven thirty eight fifty\nSo before they were talking about many GOP on I think you had a couple of course uh forget\nWhat is what is what is ... first time I think you answered it but I'm Still confused about it is it something that hooks things together it\nActually met a guy we were talking before about traditional Medicare on traditional Medicare of course just one Medicare is that the primary payer we don't have to bear with an insurance company so bug Medicare ... has a dog ... on you go into the hospital they have\nAnd Seventeen hundred dollars a doctor bull every year okay and then when you go to the doctor and a half a twenty percent co pay that we spoke about before now at many got policy is going to cover those gaps\nIn other words you're going to the hospital your many GOP policy or supplemental plan I mean they're both of the same okay they gonna pay\nFor the Seventeen hundreds of dollars are going to pay for twenty ... the co payment then there's all their benefits that they also have\nWhere if you don't have them do you have to pay him out of pocket\nSo ... the best combination is if you do for a person have medicate the best way to all the way that I Do soccer and what I think is best for me is to have traditional Medicare and part of a pardon me\nOn them party I have went on insurance company course I have to Medicare makes me get it through an insurance company okay and then I have a ... a mental plan that's going to pay for Medicare than some pay now is that an HMO no that's no okay okay so I'm HMO\nEaster plan it what are some of the limitations\nNow you get to that ... plan that's going to take over Medicare in other words it doesn't mean that you do not have Medicare pay but you do not have what is called traditional Medicare now you have an HMO that in control of your benefits\nThey're going to say what doctors you can go to our hospitals you can go to\nUh what kind of procedures your dog food allowed to do so many times you can find also that happens with medications like sometimes the insurance company to want to pay for a medication and you're that's the only medication is going to help you and the doctor I don't know if you have experienced it but we have with them\nMedication is going to help you and the doctor I don't know if you have experienced it but I we have with my wife where she needed as medication and the insurance company said nope\nHave another ... having other medication she tried it out on a medication that didn't work so that Dr how to write a letter to insurance company telling telling the insurance company my patient has to have this fall this\nAnd that's the way she got approved but she went like six days without the medication she needed so those are some of the limitations that that'd be an HMO hot\nNow you ... from what you just said explained it seemed like I'd be better off with all this stuff that you mentioned\nIt will be you'll be the best way to go again is Medicare OK traditional Medicare and they have a ... supplemental plan of course not everyone kind of for supplemental ... they could they run about a hundred and forty dollars a month\nBut if you ever you so you don't find out their benefits are having a mighty got onto you run into a difficulty and you want to go to his doctor on the HMOs and let you see a or the doctor wants to lose procedure and they ... they actually most had none of them do a procedure do another procedure\nThat or or you need a specialist and that is by chose not to your network so now you can go to that special inside your doctor recommend that you have to go to another as ... shows\nSo as long as you don't need your as your mole they're perfect when you need them that's when you see that the full ... why is better to have started to show Medicare traditional Medicare it's always the best but I have like\nI have another question that's just for us I mean I'm thirty two [laughter] right I just funny you say five years or worse [laughter] they give they were great with each other or\nOr all of age a lot of us listening here sixty five Seventy Seventy five and we're still working on his own and I want to work again and I thought I didn't want to feel like I'm Alive here [noise] now I Want to stop my I have I have company insurance my question is\nCan I drop it and get it sometimes I check into it seems like a lot cheaper than neck of the company or insurance I have now and again I Do that or will they let me while I'm working during enrollment period\nWhile you're you yeah you know like for you have to do and it's you have to to ... your group insurance okay you know you have to I mean I can still learn council that they could work and then you go you go into into Medicare okay that that's that's your choice now\nWe have to grab bag for they did because time is critical you gonna get bombarded are being bombarded right now with advertisement on cells people trying to get you to join an HMO\nIf you want to change plans\nYou have to do it between\nLast week I started a Sater all over the fifteenth calf through\nPearl Harbor day December seventh December seventh\nIf you don't do it with windows two dates you cannot do it you're gonna get stuck with insurance plan that you don't like for another year [noise] so do it now now remember that if you're stuck with an HMO and you don't like it you want to get back to traditional Medicare you can make sense of time to do it\nOkay if you're way they can make changes in charge us during the Iran all only only learn this time\nOkay so\nSo you have to do this alone again John Lever for tomorrow go ahead cold call Social Security called called Medicare ... company tell you want to counsel I make a choice now\nSo that's the time they're yeah lots of time to do\nIt so if I'm Still working have group insurance and you say that I don't have to worry about and rolling in Medicare or I can enroll in Medicare either way well while I'm working during the enrollment period\nNow remember when you have when you turn sixty five okay you're automatically enroll\nIn part a I'm ... now you can you don't have to do par be when you turn sixty five or you're out on insurance if you're a group\n... that's I don't yeah I don't have an awesome I'm not using partly\nActivists Barbie as you know Barbie will cost you\nI think ... on um dollars among no no bar because ... not a hundred and thirty eight dollars oh my yes yes and then so but you don't have to have any direct group insurance now once you you know if you want to cancel your group insurance then you have to pay for that Barbie\nFiber which ...\nSo I I Do I okay so I Do not have to enroll in Medicare and if I Do is there a penalty\n... know while you have group insurance now let's say that a person chooses not to have pardon me because I don't want to spend a hundred and fifty dollars a month yeah which by the way normally they take it out of his Social Security check so like I you know I don't even feel it\nBecause they've taken out of my Social Security checks so is is an automatic kind of payment however let's say I said no I don't\nWant that you can't stop the governor I'd say I don't want to be right now can you stop it\nYeah yeah I I can then several from pardon me but then what happens is let's say I go to three years without part B I now want to join par be All right so now I Want to get penalize for what for not having pardon me\nAnd I want to do a later role meant oh okay so what's that based on the ... is that that's going to be a ... is when they are going to charge your ... I Believe it's ten percent a year\nNow all of your of your premium so yeah I mean they it can be can be costly as especially if you're on a fixed income exactly exactly so if you retire if your entire by all means\nYou know he's ... now you used to be that you had to apply for Barbie now they've made it out um addict so let you know get the par a Barbie you going to sign up with an insurance company for prescription drugs\nWhich is a party\nAnd that's I mean that's the that's the best way\nYou're talking about using you mention is that Medicare part B in part they were not free but I Know people that do not have to pay for it Mm what's that well\nIt's incredible what we can do now and it's not always running and throw the biggest thing you can at it because the biggest thing is not going to service you write\nMore about that when you go into a home ... ... talk about the ah the ... and they may be moving around is it different\nFrom the bedroom to the living room on what you're looking for well we don't let you technically but I'm just kinda generally speaking\nFor different parts of the house any different things number one if you have a a high volume area we are a lot of people come in and out of it as let's say the family room or the movie room you want to make sure you have plenty of circulation there and most of their homes will not built with enough of return ...\nSo you find yourself to return home just to improve the air quality it's not something that\nTo take some electricity round and it's not something that's going to cost you anything extra it just improves the home and with the filtration systems that they have now that it's so much more advanced than they used to be\nWe can make it almost just as clean as a hospital or we can put a media filter which we incorporate knowledge systems to improve through the air quality plus the fact you only have to change the filter once every six months [noise]\nPeople can't remember the chains are batteries in their smoke detectors and they really forget about their conditioning filters\nOf course that's important for people who have allergies and other health issues uh to keep them clean than to change them out regularly Denise units um how they want in for the most part on\nMost of the ... come with a twenty year he changed your warranty tenure parts tenure coral attend your compressor\nIs that a standard water you'd say or\nThat's the standard warranty for American Standards I see and you can get an extended warranty when you work it out it's usually less than ten percent of the cost of the entire unit settle carry on labor for ten years\nNow we're talking about American standard and general out what was the second company trains paint my apologies so we're talking about the two at these two I Know for a fact are very high quality units and they had a long history don't they\nAre yes and then then it's not my carry and started the industry off the they were in their right behind them and they're much more quality unit or we liked the fact that they're produced right here in Tyler, Texas and uh we're a big one about promoting American Made parts\nSo the the two companies both here in Texas is that correct\nYes sir called uh they're they're owned by each other American standard is on if you look at your sticker on a train and says by the American standards have been\nQuite play [noise] so what stands what helps you stand out amongst all the AC people in Houston\nWhile the number one thing a service after the sale when I take care of you before we put the unit in\nWe make sure you're satisfied with it we go back and check it to make sure everything is exactly right we're balance it out for you we put a damper on every ... because there's like water types of passively resistance so if you don't ... the the units at the plant and then you have no control over your air and where it's going [noise]\nUh the filtration systems we incorporate\nAre are so much advance what they used to have with a little thin one inch filter\nAnd it helps control the humidity in the house when you've size everything correctly we only use factory sheet metal that goes straight through\nAnd you don't have any buckles of bows or what we call a brick wall and there were it's the air's running up against something that was misleading from begin with\nAnd a lotta times you'll find the older units that are out there\nA one size properly and on top of that they weren't set properly or something as simple as not being far enough off the addict floor\nTo as you're a rate of decline in your brain line then you're sitting there with the gravity field line that's overflowing and not pulling the humidity out of the house it's sitting in the bottom of the call if it's not designed right has not installed right if it's not the right size unit then you're not going to be happy with once you get\nThat Daniel profit system designer and air
