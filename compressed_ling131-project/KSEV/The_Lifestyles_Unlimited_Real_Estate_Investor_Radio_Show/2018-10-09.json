mentioned\nI'm In and we kept it as a rental for then we had to rentals plus our home and the four Plex she mentioned [noise]\nAnd they all had a a fair amount of equity in them but a single family

you decided you're going to do this you also decided to go to the to the bus tour in fact both and I remember seeing you there\nAnd uh you know like I said you're pretty positive guy but you came on to me with one of the few negative comments ever from you which was but what if I Can't get a deal I don't mind you I don't mind spending the money to be a member but what if I Can't get a deal how did you work through that with mark\n[noise] [noise] yeah I I think it was just a matter of I talked to a number of people that were current investors multifamily deals and I you know talk to them about how they went about that process uh when I went to the expo\nYou know talk to them about how they went about that process\nUm when I went to the expo I actually had opportunity on the bus tour to to talk face to face with Robert Martinez for a few minutes which um ended up being the first deal I got into he was gracious enough I think to open up a spot for a new a preferred investor member and so I got into\nHis maple trail apartments um towards the end of April and uh also uh gotten to speak with David Barbara who was a KP on very diverse deal and I got in I'm In an investment with her so just going to the expo\nMe a lot of face to face opportunities to talk with leads to talk with people that were invested in properties\nAnd then going out on the bus tour and actually getting to walk in the what you know what a typical property might look like and what some of the things they were doing\nI think that made a real to me it was it was a physical experience that I was a part of and prior to that at all been on the radio so it had been sort of are removed\nWhen you went on that road trip where did you think that was your first actual road trip to the bus tour was what was your thoughts on that when you were driving around looking at other people's businesses they're sharing theirself\nWell it's very impressive I mean I again I sort of had a theoretical understanding of what was going on but to actually\nYou know go on busses filled with other investors and other people that were interested in real estate get a chance to talk to them and then to have all the lead investors or you know get on the bus tell us you know all the numbers they were very transparent you know this is what we bought the property for this is\nWhat we've done to renovate and rehab the property um these are our plans here these are the kinds of returns that were getting um it was just\nA you know very transparent and very exciting to be able to see the possibilities for you know what real estate investment could look like as a passive investor which is um what I wanted to do\nWhat typical where did you get from the bus to rather than speaking to a Robert ... did you come away saying okay I Want to do this kind of deal that got to deal with this location that location what what kinds of things were going through your mind\nI mean I I think I was always sort of interested in in the idea of value plays getting into a deeper value play that uh\nYou know they're going to put a lot of money and upfront and try to raise the value of the property and raise the occupancy and raise the rent for failure net operating income was going to go out and the you're going to\nHave forced appreciation for that idea was very appealing to me I Know that those are becoming a little more difficult to find I think at the place where we are in the market it seems like a but I was interested in that and as far as locations I was looking at\nUm [noise] I I haven't there I sort of tend to research the places once I see the different opportunities that come up so I've been able to get into a couple of of deals with Brian Sutton than Atlanta and I've gotten into\nA deal with the ship he's in San Antonio and with Brian effort in Fort Worth Texas from my spots that are being tax of\nThem so um you know different I I like a diversification I Know you've talked before about people getting diversified with different leads in different geographical location and that seems to have some merit to it\nSo you diversified quite a bit both geography geographically or by a different leads seven deals in all what's interesting to me though to finish up this segment where does it was seven deals you remember your fear was you wouldn't be able to find a deal right\nThere were seven ... over what period of time and you got thirty seconds to answer that\nAh it's been about seven months and so the first the first to deal for three deals I got in in the first three months and then there was a period of about four or five months where I didn't get into anything and then in the last month a form ordeal seven become available and I've had some some capital to invest

interesting story you have about how your training your children to think of ... and early at a very early age wanted to pick that up and take it for how old they were when you first started teaching them\nHow your system works and what you're doing with them because I think a lot of people will benefit from this\nSure do I think you know just growing up and and it pretty traditional home and just having the idea that I was going to get a job and worked for forty\nFive years and I might not quite get that far but I'll get close I might get thirty five years or thirty three years um I didn't really see any other alternative for none of that I started reading and learning about you know alternative sources of income and learning about real estate investing and specifically the lifestyle model and I have to uh\nTo say thank you to your Dell and also to all the lifestyle staff just for the incredible ... ecosystem that you guys have created with a lead investors and half of investors than the white paper and\nJust the way that you protect the path of investors I think is is an incredible thing but I wanted to pass on to my kids just the idea that\nThere are other options out there and that um you know they may not choose to get a job or multiple jobs ... jobs don't seem to last as long these days as they did when\nWhen my dad was growing up um you know I Want them to have other options and real estate is one of them and for my kids to the what we're doing and I talk to them about the deals were getting into\nAnd I created as a teacher a little um sheet that got the student real estate deal document it's called the non binding non contract for\nIt basically something that I have my kids still out all the important information about a property and as I mentioned before my mother when she was alive when my kids were\nJust born she had given that meets two thousand dollars to go toward their their college fund and I had never put that in five twenty nine planets just been sitting in the bank and suddenly had to brainstorm you know four or five months ago I Need to use the money to teach my kids that are real estate and so I made a an unofficial\nUm opportunity for them to get into the first deal I got into with Robert Martinez and to be a one percent owner of the part\nOf the deal that we were in and so they got excited about that and they said okay if I put this money and I'm going to be able to get a certain return and maybe a few years down the line if there's a refinance I might get a chunk of my money back\nAnd we started talking about\nYou know what that would look like going forward and and I and no way a this is all voluntary I'd never say that you have to do this and I've in fact told the kids if you ever get to the point where you don't want to do this anymore you know give you a thousand dollars back that we're investing for you and and you don't have to be up\nAnd the more you know give you a thousand dollars back that we're investing for you and and you don't have to be a part of this but they're they're both very excited about it they're learning a lot and they see it as a as a way to you know increased um you know their network that they get older and maybe have different options\nHow old are the no\nUh my daughter is an eighth grader she's Thirteen and my son is a sixth grader he's eleven\nHow did you get them interested in this\nI think they just watch what I'm doing and they saw that I was going off to a two day seminar and they saw that I was\nExcited about what I was doing your lifestyle and\nYou know I think the idea of you know how you can create investments that are going to continue to you know give off cash flow into the you know for three four five six years until a deal might be sold and then you can reinvest that I think\nYou know both of them have some limited understanding of of money and are interested in how they could do that my daughter's a couple of years away from\nBeing able to drive so of course you start thinking about you know a car maybe what college I Want to go to and\nSo I think is mainly just watching me and seeing what I'm doing and being interested in that and I tried to share with\nThem or videos that we've had sent back on one of the properties of being renovated and those kind of thing [noise]\nAll right so quickly took a break we'll be right back with more totally
