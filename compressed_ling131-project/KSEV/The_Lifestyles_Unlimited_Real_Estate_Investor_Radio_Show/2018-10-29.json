that\nReal estate's indications have become a big thing now almost everybody in the brothers doing them and they're out there on the Internet everywhere everybody's trying to grab your attention by giving all sorts of content and stuff and motivational speeches and whatever to try to get you to be their customers to invest in their deals\nAnd I have to tell you that in most cases or an obviously most cases these guys are just unscrupulous crooks\nYes I'm willing to say it I'm willing to prove it\nBut I'm willing to say it if I Need to prove it that will just track him down and see what they're really doing see if they'll come alive and give us their information gives exactly what they're doing exactly about the money they're taking out of every deal the exact amount of returns each person's earning and the bottom line is they will do that because they know that I write so\nWater we got to learn here what we have to learn is that back when I started lifestyles a limited I started it because I was upset about people\nIs that back when I started life as a limited I started it because I was upset about people taking my money stockbrokers financial planners four one K.

of my money one of the two\nI came to the conclusion by about age twenty nine that I could lose my own money I didn't need to pay people fees overrides commissions to lose my money I could lose my own money the truth of the matter is once I figured that out and was willing to take the risk\nI never lost money because when you're dealing with your own money its whole lot different than using other people's money like these solutions when they're raising capital and doing unbelievably large deals\nThey don't care if the deal makes money or not they're making money on fees on the way in on the way through the deal and the way out these guys are taking real estate commissions on the front and acquisition fees on the friday and they're taking a management fees they're taking Asset Management

show talking about should occasions real fish indications and\nUh the first segment we talked about how there's people out there there's just ripping you off left and right if you say he was talking about what happened here watch sales I I really believe you should buy your own real estate\nAh but as it went there were people that want to do invest it didn't have the time people high net worth Hi I'm ... was word for it highly compensated individuals'\nBig guys doctors lawyers support that didn't have the time in their own mind to go do it so they asked if they can invest and as they invested with me and ... realized this was not much of a women's speaking this was made invested with me watch those had nothing to do with it and other people out lifestyles those getting educated by me saw this and said they want to do the same thing\nIt's a problem is once we saw that people started copying me there was a problem the problem was is that my deals all made money they were very profitable because I was an operations expert from the very beginning\nBecause of that the way my share which set up where I got a portion of the profit based on the profit if there is no profit I got nothing I was directly allied with the investors that\nOn the profit if there's no profit I got nothing I was directly allied with the investors that we either both benefited a we both lost very closely allied\nWhat happened with other people tried to do this they didn't have the operational skills they were willing to put in the upper they they just didn't have what it took to be a lead investor as we call them um their deals started to suffer\nAnd eventually if you if you don't have any profit and you're getting paid only on the profit the guys would bail and at first it was almost all guys at the beginning now there's women\nUm that's why they bailed these people would be stop these people that didn't have time to operate property for just left in the lurch with this real estate transactions with no one to operate it and if the higher demand for recovery to come in there was absolutely no profit left because now they're paying fees and there was no fees that wherever intended into the deal\nSo what I came up with is look if you guys are going to do these deals you better put eight feet into every deal\nSo that that person doing it has an income so that that can quit their jobs and operate the property they have an incentive to operate the property and not run away and number three if they do run away you've got to the already in the the numbers to go out there and higher management company\nAnd so this works out and we started getting more and more people doing these deals but pretty soon people started doing it for the fees\nAnd that is the downfall of all this what I said from the very beginning the reason I start lifestyle to get people away from investors that live on fees from stockbrokers and financial planners and four one K. administrators and real estate indicators who live on these fees\nAnd so they started trying to take front in fees management fees consulting fees real estate commission fees mortgage broker fees as a manager fees\nExit strategy fees and\nThe deals were making no money for the past as they're making money for the lead so we had to come together\nAs a group and say wait a minute\nAnd we have this group of people that are all the best real estate investors in the country I don't care what anybody says there may be people that are on more real estate because they're just pure rapists syndicator Z but they're not better operators we're the best operators in the country\nIn our group how do we know that we won the national park association real estate investor award eleven actually I think it's twelve years in a row from two thousand seven to nine I Won two thousand six two thousand seven on through with eleven or twelve hour be counted it where you were the best of the country\nBut these guys out there that are syndicate or they don't care if they do well or not they're just raising more capital because more capital means more deals which means more fees which means they get rich no matter what happens to the bathroom and doctors so we got together and said look we've got to set up\nIn lifestyles as a group of people that belong to a like minded\nPrivate group\nA co-op of people say we all agree that lead should not take advantage of passes we believe that the need to be educated sophisticated what they do I need to follow a set of rules so we came up with a thing called a white paper\nOr white papers shut down the rules by which you could raise capital by which you could put deal together\nAnd how you had to pay your password investors how you have to finance a deal how you had to um ... put out financial statements and partner should be everything from a to Z located evaluate negotiate finance close operate\nAnd liquidate\nRules for everything so that the people that were putting their money in your deal\nWould be safe or safer\nAnd if you wanted to be in our group solicitor you had to sign this agreement that you would follow this editor to the rules if you wouldn't then you couldn't be a solicitor and our group\nAnd you'd have to leave that the first step to solving problems and come back for rights is the second and third step is to make it easy to

larger the deal the more the deal the largest deals they do\nThe more fees they can charge so they're going to try to talk to you and they're doing very very large deals with them\nMy experience twenty Thirty years of doing this I can prove this to you without a doubt the larger deal the larger the deal the lower the rate of return the more expensive the deal the lower the rate of return why because when you get up there doing deals with very very expensive deals you're dealing with very sophisticated investors\nMyself I'm a peanut compared to some of these guys out there I go out there and I tried to buy twenty thirty forty million dollar deals or is that the zone I work is\nRight and I get outbid on stuff all the time\nAll the time I still when here and there but I get up at all the time because I'm I'm not that big a player in that world but these guys out there have funds\nThat they are just like the indicators that funds the money's not there they don't care what ready to retire they earn their goal is to close the deal because they get paid these I Can't do that because I'm investing\nMy own money what I put up ten twenty or thirty million dollars well money to buy an apartment complex that's my money\nI better earn ten percent return all my money I better earn it capital gains over a hundred percent of the year or two or three I better earn that much money if I don't get those returns but if it's somebody else's buddy who cares what return\nYou get right who even cares the answer they don't they only care about their fees and that's what they're working on

let you look at their financial statements from the previous deals really look at the financial statements\nWill uh gosh I don't know that our group they do\nRight they're willing to let you we
