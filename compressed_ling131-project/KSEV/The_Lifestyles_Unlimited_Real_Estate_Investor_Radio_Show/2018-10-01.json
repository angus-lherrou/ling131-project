started back up on this thing I quit because I'd run into all of a road block I just could not figure out how to overcome and\nWhen I came back to it with a fresh set of eyes and looked at it and went back to the same educational materials that I purchased before for another do this stuff I was starting to see things that I'd never seen before\nAnd the basic thing that I was seeing was that my base approach to the whole thing was wrong and I made some very very big ongoing mistakes multiples of such that I just couldn't have foreseen\nAnd I think whenever anybody's not successful in life\nRight it's because they're starting out with the wrong impression what works and what does it you can do a whole lot of what does it work and it still won't work you can do it faster you can do is harder

problem\nSo\nYou have an approach you have a point of view about what it is you're up against\nAnd if you have that point of view to be wrong\nThen no matter what your conclusions are to how to fix that those conclusions are going to be wrong also the next statement is you can't solve the problem with the same level of taking the problem was created at so if your base knowledge is what created the problem\nYou you can't fix that problem into you go back and change the base knowledge now today's show is going to be about all these different levels of base knowledge right because there are a

accomplish the goal no matter how hard you work no matter how fast you work no matter how many\nTimes you try to do it it's going to continue to fail\nSo we talked about you know fitness and hell diet is the secret to losing weight and watch your diet you're going to be fit for the rest of your life\nBut if you have any other theory that there's any other way pills you can take a you know ... medications you can take a\nSuper special diets the you know you have to eat the right amount of food the right number of calories the right types of calories and you'll states that but\nThat's just the basic assumption being wrong on everybody else was accomplishment should try to accomplish that kind of fitness let's go on those talk about finances\nWhat basis options do you have about finances let's start out with the very basic when your head for the beginning of your life you believe that had been told to have a lot of money you have to have a good job\nTo get a good job and you can get a college education well that's\nGet a good job and you can get a college education well that's just not the case that is not the case at all I don't have a college education that I've never had a good job\nSo the assumption from the very beginning has got you trapped at trying to accomplish something that can be accomplished with the way you're trying to accomplish\nYou believe the getting up and willing to work every day is going to solve your problem you to believe that right until you retired Seventy years of age you're going to work the rest of your life because you're not going to be able to get rich doing work\nYou have to do something differently but you believe that all has to do with work and when you have the space assumption you think about it [noise] there's college education really make you wealthy\nWell back when I was a kid they had statistics that said if you make if you go to this school you get this amount of money if you can earn this amount of money in her lifetime if you go to this level school your nose and all those basic statistics whether they were true or not at the time the\nTheory the assumption behind them was false because the assumption is some financial success comes from having a job and the job comes from having an education\nAnd that is what makes people rich\nAnother option basic assumption that I've had my whole life is that I can live on half of whatever iron and the secret to that is not carrying the what I live on today in other words when you start out as a kid\nYou don't pay for anything so when you get your first job I Know you want to run out of by a car you want to run out by computer you want to run out and spend money but the truth of the matter is whatever it is you earn half of it's more than what you had last year\nNow each year you're going to earn more money which means each you or your standard of living is going to go up\nAnd when I made thirty thousand year old lived on Fifteen one of eight forty I Lived on twenty when I got to fifty Olympian twenty five but I got the Seventy I Lived on thirty five when I got to a hundred I Lived on fifty one I got the two hundred I Lived on a hundred\nBut I found that I never really needed to live on more than a hundred thousand dollars a year\nAnd so at the time without making two hundred I'm saving a hundred the following year I made more than me three hundred bucks do lived on the hundreds and now I'm seeing two hundred and to continue to do that to where I started making so much money was living in such a small percentage of it\nThat I got rich that's the secret produce more income\nAnd save more money that your secret take the more money and produce lower income with the reinvest it and grow exponentially and financially for the rest of your life and every year should be better than a year before because you have more money to invest\nSo you were going to continue to elevate your financial position and you're going to continue to elevate the status which you allow yourself to live\nBut you're never gonna impair the ability to grow\nSo that's a ... theory that I've had since I was a kid\nAnd all the people that had things I didn't have when I was younger because I wouldn't spend my money now look up to me and go boy I Wish I Would have had that base belief I guess I'd love to be a multi millionaire but he would love to be but you wouldn't do what it takes to be and you wouldn't believe what it takes to believe\nYour belief system is flawed your parents belief system is flawed look around yourself and ask yourself this question which is you drive and listen to his podcast or whatever who around you is a multimillionaire\nBell washed out we all know a ton of them because we all think the same way\nBut who around you has really become a multimillionaire financially free individual and you're going to figure out you can count those people in your whole lifetime one head\nAnd because of that you don't have the

things you do physically mentally socially to get where you want to go in whatever it is you're trying to accomplish will fail\nIt just won't work now I'm going to complicate the battery more could what we're talking about here is that you know in your fitness what are your base ideas do they are they write it incorrect\nOr in finances what are your base ideas and theories are they right or they corrected they function are they effective or in your family what does your basic beliefs about family and about relationships are they effective do they work or they do not work from the very beginning you're either going to be good at having relationships you you're not\nA you can do a thousand other things to try to make a relationship work but if you don't have the basic foundation of relationships together that it's not going to work [noise]\nUm you know you're going to talk about your health again I was talking about the doctor that I had to force to change my medication now interestingly enough\nI'm when all of my\nA test case that perfect the doctor lowered the dose of the medication that I\nHad her getting me\nAnd I said why were perfect now she was well I don't want you to become of and what would be\nTo where the medication would not be effective anymore in other words I my body would become accustomed to it and then we would lose that tool to work with his which basically was explaining that I thought to myself okay I get that I think but\nWhy you know is that really what we want to do and sure enough some she cut the dosage back then my blood sugar level went back up again now it's not up in the in the dangerous sold look I got\nProblems that come from dire diabetes a coal neuropathy which means you can't feel about him to your feet eventually you have to cut your feet off or whatever and I don't want that to progress\nAnd so I may have to have a heart heart talk with her again because what am I saying your base theory in medicine is to treat the symptoms\nAnd to let the patient die to medicate them for life\nI don't want to treat the symptoms I Want to fix the problem\nRight and if there's something that my body can't do like produce insulin or this or that then let's not hold out hope that my body figure that out let's get it fixed right\nSo it all these aspects\nWe have to start with the base is the correct basis my bad assumption was that an endocrinologist knew what the heck they're talking about and it's funny\nWhen I Would ask them questions about things that were slightly off center from what they just wanted to get in there give me some medication to be out of there they could they could talk about the topic\nThey weren't interested in talking about the topic but they could converse about the topic they knew that there were other things that can be done but the doctors are not paid to kill you\nBecause if you were ... they wouldn't be needed any longer does that make sense and so your financial planner isn't intended to make you rich\nBecause of the major which you wouldn't need him anymore\nThat's the difference folks the people that you have out there in your life telling you what to do and how to do it\nDo not have your best interest in mind it almost any case do you deal with and that's what you've got to learn to manage yourself now once you start deciding manager so now you've got another problem and this is where it gets very complicated and that is you've got to manage your own personality\nOur greatest strength and our greatest week this is our personality we are who we are\nAnd our greatest weakness is our personality we are who we are because of what we do we do what we do 'cause what we think and believe we act the way we act because how we believe we should act\nWhen you change from person to person\nTheir basic belief systems about themselves are completely different some people bleed being happy and friendly as the way to approach life at all costs other people believe that being grumpy and mean and defense if that's the way to approach life at all cost\nBoth of them believe that what they're doing is giving them the best results that they can get for themselves\nNow it really gets complicated when you get down to type a type B personalities\nAnd into you ever can realize where the euro type a or a type B personality you're never really going to be able to get a hold of yourself and get yourself to where you need to be your life\nSo we come back from the break we'll talk about a type a personality which is somebody has instantaneous gratification disease compared to a type B personality or somebody that has analysis paralysis disease and how one of them\nStarts a thousand projects and finishes none of them and how the other one\nWon't do anything different their whole life\nJust keep doing the same old thing for the rest of their life and how and what does this lead to as far as the result of your life will take a short
