U. S. D. V.\nWelcome back to the lifestyle unlimited real estate investor radio show on your ... and today we're providing them more effective road map to your financial freedom by using an investment strategy called Chung king\nI first learned that strategy from del ... back in two thousand seven two thousand eight when I turned on the radio and he was talking about it and I put it into action\nAnd became a lifestyle unlimited number and the rest is history it's been an incredible change in paradigm for me\nOn how the world works how to create wealth how to retire\nAnd I'd like to share that with you\nDuring the show I Want you to think about what your doing right now and the fact that if you continue to do this over and over and over again you are going to get the same result and it isn't retirement\nIt isn't the retirement that you really want to know how do you get there we're going to talk about that if you'd like to ask a question any time during the show you can email ask Glenn\nAsk Glenn L. Y. N. N. F. L. U. I. N. C. dot com ask Glenn at L. U. I. N. C.\nYou I and C. dot com ask Glenn at L. U. I. N. C. dot com so we redefined retirement and wealth is when you have enough passive income to cover all your bills you're financially independent the how do we get there\nCovering all your bills can sound daunting at first if your monthly expenses are four thousand dollars will say that's the I think it's probably the average for\nMost Americans four thousand dollars or something that most of us can live on with our current lifestyle creating four thousand dollars a month the cash flow can seem impossible how do you do that you're working\nForty fifty sixty some of the Seventy and eighty hours a week to bring that money and so how can you create that in some other way well you're still working how do you do that\nEspecially if you don't know anyone who's even tried to do it it's still often says leader go places others have never been and send back apps and back when he was thirty four years old Dell began to send back the map for retiring in a different way\nThe chunk in concept helps you get past this mental roadblock at the time tested map to financial freedom [noise] if you buy four houses\nThat generate two hundred and twenty dollars each and passive cash in positive cash flow as fast as an income it's it's relatively passive you're going to do some work for this but most of the time that's mailbox money just showed that\nMonth after month after month if you follow how we teach you to invest in real estate\nAnd when you have those four properties for rental homes and generate two hundred and twenty dollars each and positive cash flow every month you just increased your net income by eight hundred and eighty dollars a month\nAnd because of depreciation you're not paying income taxes Social Security taxes or Medicare taxes on that money right now\nYou're eight hundred and eighty dollars a month better off\nThat could cover your house payment\nYou could buy another helps to pay your electric bill like two hundred and twenty dollars a month probably pay your electric bill maybe your electric and gas here by another house\nTo pay your car payment to on a really nice car you buy two and instead of saving up that money for that car and buying it outright are putting a down payment on the car if you buy one or two properties\nAnd all they have to do with cash flow two hundred and twenty dollars a month you'll be able to drive a car\nFor as long as you had those properties or if you sell those properties and moved to other properties I take the equity that you gain and those\nAnd go to four properties or you'll be able to have a car in a boat [laughter] [laughter] whatever it is it your heart desires\nAnd you always be able to do that that's been a very effective strategy for me even though I Am now a multi family investor I still have the property that pays for my car and I think about it like that\nAnd wants to buy a car is paid off starts to give me a little bit of trouble I can give that car away the last one I gave a super WRX to one of the mechanics at the place where I take my card to get a tune ups\nHad changed his life and I went on about another car with no financial difference in my position because I've got that house pays for my cars so we'll come back after this short break and talk about how to start by just that one rental house I\nAnd will continue to talk about checking and how it can change your life I'm ... and you're

lifestyles unlimited real estate investor radio show I'm your ... here\nWorking on your financial freedom and we're discussing a topic I'm passionate about today Chongqing a simple way to build wealth and the come financially free to become retired no matter what your age\nWe've defined wealth as enough cash flow from our real estate investments to cover all our monthly bills this is the definition of retirement as well when you have passive income coming in that covers all of your bills and you are not working very hard for that money you are retired\nAnd that is what we all think about in retirement even though we're not set up under the current paradigm with for one k.'s and working in corporate America to make that happen so you have to do something different and jumping as a way\nTo start by using this strategy of chunky assigning the cash flow from each investment property we by to pay a specific monthly bill\nWe could get most people to retirement and two to five years but what if you want a better lifestyle\nHow does this strategy help you live the lifestyle you really want more travel more fun experiences with our friends and family the opportunity to learn new things more opportunities to get back to your community those are the things that I hear people say every day\nThat's there why\nWhy are they working so hard why are they doing what they're doing why are they looking for a different better way because they see that what they're doing doesn't work and that's why I have to do with their family their friends have free time to just think to really explore your creative side again and to be able to give back\nHis charitable contributions and charitable activities that people would do if they weren't just so doggone tired\nFrom the twenty four seven three sixty five worked cycle that we're all in right now it's a tough way to live sex we've got to find a better way\nTo when we end up the last segment we're talking about the importance of staying laser focused on the next step and I gave an example of driving from San Francisco to ... to New York you don't have to be able to see the Empire State building in order to get there\nRight you're not trying to keep that in your sights as you drive your following a nap and if that math is correct you will make it to New York\nThat's a big ... because it only works when you have the right map if you have the wrong nap and you're only looking ahead to the next turn you're going to end up somewhere else someplace unexpected and probably unwanted so you have to take the time up front to get the right map\nFind a mentor that successfully made the trip and fall of them\nOf course we think the best way to do this is to attend to lifestyles unlimited for investor workshop\nTo get started if you're ready right now you can call our team and you can get registered for that work shop at eight six six nine four five six five six five that eight six six nine four five six five six five or you

driving an old car for way too long have you been doing the Dave Ramsey thing you you know paid off your your bills right and now you just have your monthly expenses\nYou know paid off your your bills right and now you just have your monthly expenses that you're still try that that old car\nRight so instead of asking how can I possibly afford this ask yourself how can I acquired a cash flowing property that'll pay for this\nIf you want a higher standard of living by income producing real estate investments to pay for it\nChongqing can create a lifestyle with no limit you can have the lifestyle you've always wanted and you don't have to wait until your employer or the government allows you to retire and enjoy it\nChucking put you in control of your future and that was the biggest change it made in my life just looking at things differently I Want to go on a nice vacation I Want to take my whole family with me [noise] save up money save up money to save up money save up money\nAnd the nights occasion for just an average size family of four and caused quite a bit of money but if it's that I that that money in a in a rental property I may be taking vacations on a
