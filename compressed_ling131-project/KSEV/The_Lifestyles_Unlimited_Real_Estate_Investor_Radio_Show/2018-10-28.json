what's your mind [noise] yes [noise] yes we we\nCaretakers are provided services and this services do not involve\nA clinical professional okay worrying home health on a hospice we're working on the doctor's orders and the people that are going to be taking care of you are licensed professionals\nWhen it comes to caretakers on or provider services depending on how you call it ...\nThe first one I was going to take care of you has been trained to take care of you with your basic they lead\nNecessities that age they're being trained on how to give you a bath ... late in other words how to transfer you said from your wheelchair through your Walker said from the wheelchair to the shower\nWheelchair through your Walker said from the wheelchair to the shower bench\nOr from your bed to the wheelchair if you need a wheelchair or if you're using a wheelchair they being trained on light plane you know cleaning keeping the area where the Fisher College clean they being trained on how to prepare light meals\nAre they being a train them how to\nGrow allow that are unique training for this but you know they know that they need to if they need to go to the grocery store for you they will do that if they need to go to a pharmacy or for you to pick up a prescription that will do that\nIf you need somebody to go with you to the doctor they kind of as scorcher to the doctor and\nThe way for you or would be with you while you're with a doctor and then then come back with you\nSo Garcia the basic things how to care taker will do so so what does a provider do that provide as a caretaker I Know that I'd like as soon as they have kept it was like like like for instance we're very proud to to be part of that the Veterans Administration\nKind of care system even though we don't we're not employed by the\nBy the VA okay but we are contracted with NBA and we've been doing this for us if we're being in\nBusiness for twelve years we've been doing it for almost eleven uh on what we do for the VA the veterans scattered service which is similar to what we do with other patients where we sent a provider tutor homes\nFor they have two different services for one of them were goal I taught off ten hours a week for another two hours each day five ... five times a week is usually Monday through friday but if\nBut it could be differently to now with a V. eight in that go on to that particular program we sent a CNA and nurses assistant\nAnd uh and the VA goals that at home health aide\nSorry the it gets confusing but that are I I just want to keep a simple for the for our listeners that you're my eyes are rolling around I don't exercise ... depending on who you're talking to you they call it something else but a caretaker or if or providers somebody's going to help you\nWith your basic necessities so can one choose a caretaker or provider Oh yes you can yes you can have that right exactly because they do not need a state license if you have a say in neighbor have relative\nSomeone you know that that takes care of somebody that took care of your friends over your relative I you know that you can trust this person that\nYou really want that first one to be the one\nTo take care of you yes we can you that the only the only thing that I Need to do is I Need to come to our agency we complete they need to complete you know the same paperwork\nThat any other employee you of ours who complete they do have to have a clean brought background we do check criminal backgrounds and\nThat is required by the state law so all our employees checked we have to check their criminal background means fingerprints pictures no no no it doesn't go that far we all we need to do is check the get the criminal record shell from the department of public safety and\nThey have to me that the state requirements so\nA is a person doesn't have a criminal record and they're able to perform their duties that they need to cause\nLike one time this lady told me that she wanted her next door neighbor to do to be her provider so I'd say sure tell her to come in and complete the paper or\nWhen the lady came this lady was using the ... hardly walk so how can that person take care of she can't don't care of her she she needs help herself so so they have to be physically able\nTo do the tasks that are required so that falls under Hadiya qualified to be one so\nYeah I made like you said it basically you know you have to have a sound mind body and ... on a good clinical I or go criminal record rabbi ground right okay so how does want to know if one qualifies for the service oh oh okay so so in order to its\nCage in order to qualify for caretaker services are provided services\nIn the past was going to pay for it\nIf you're going to pay for them yourself if this is a private pay ... and if you have\nMoney or not or you don't have to be wealthy or anything like that because you can say Felix at one of the caretaker\nFour hours a week and you know that it's not a lot of money that will that sixty nine dollars for four hours of service now that you're going to go and pay yourself but Medicare doesn't take care of that part of it no medical care they'll some pay for providing services\nNow Medicaid or ... or so a lot or a ... or we have approximately\nA hundred and forty patients are clients because Medicaid\nDoesn't call our patients patients they caught him clients I we have our nature would that I think everyone that we take care of it is our patient a personal thing right so so out of a hundred and forty a we have about a hundred and forty patients that Medicaid pay for those services\nSo that now I Would like to talk about something that ... a lot of people that qualify for Medicaid they said no I ... I I applied to years ago and I don't qualify for Medicaid nano\n... talk to laws will will help you out lie\nI knew my my you'll you'll be surprised many people have said that they do not apply for Medicaid do apply for ... um [noise] a lot of qualified that do qualify for Medicaid and\nWatch 'em at if you qualify for Medicaid you that a lot a lot of services available I Want to leverage provided services and they they can give you twenty hours services so weak fatty our service is so weak or whatever it takes whatever it takes or you don't pay a penny so that's something to to consider so you have\nA an area that gets a lot of splash back you know in the door from a root for whatever the case may be whether the whether oh yeah yeah weather's the weather absolutely sorry set pretty neat oh yeah it's a it's an extraordinary product I mean it's we don't have to use it in every instance ... but it in most cases furniture or you can be\nSuch that protect for him as popular with the with the people\nIt is yes but I it's it's it's something that we ... most people don't know about it until it's brought to their attention but once they see the difference between that and just a standard finger joined in wood frame okay there is no comparison\nWhile excellent uh this is Rob your Allen either one of your thought what's the difference between a store buy a store my doors that you get\nAt the store and and your doors with the jury similarity or is it yeah you know I'm\nYelling a store bought on a store bought door you'll find that when you look at the edge hearing\nOn the doors you'll see a raw wood edge it may be prime murder painted but it'll still being exposed would edge okay on our doors we have a complete fiberglass wrapped edge so there is no would expose nothing for the weather to get to whatsoever okay so it's like having a complete fiberglass shell\nFor your door then you know all we're doing a dad in hardware hinges ... frame and you've got something you can probably use underwater so I think that's good to hear you enter a\nAnd the and there's three different levels and the doors you know we haven't embark singing in a heritage we like to sickness kind of the middle of the road door but you get all the benefits whether you get the the hardwood rails and styles\nYou get a three week whether strip bottom you get a composite sill well the whole nine yards so it's a it's a very very good door no complaints there who none none whatsoever\nAll right we're talking with Dr we're also up Alan here and Clinton and uh they represent say vision window and doors and you're in is it ... yeah we're out and all that that's right yeah my mine still here just a surf you ready for an upgrade all your windows or as well as your doors\nAnd oh you have a special on doors you haven't said that when\nYou don't know yeah there really haven't yeah there's a we have a great central indoors especially for the people that want doors percentage which we always recommend because you can get a much nicer looking either paint or staying job on a pre finished factory\nPaint or staying then you can't have it done after the fact and ... and we will do will do I paint or staying on one side of the door and no charge\n'em and that will save a customer around for four twenty five for the ... side of doing a door so that again is a great deal you use that deal doesn't come along very often\nAnd it's one of those we run it about five six weeks and then like I said once it's gone it's gone and then the price goes back to you know the normal price so but it's a it's a great deal to get that especially for a pre finish door\nAnd it uses a again ... as well or mostly ... exterior\nYeah hello can you know all of our stuff is exterior on that yeah we do make sure you know we do just picture doors but we also do the you know sliding doors a fringe doors a hinge patio doors a single entry doors whatever the case may be on an extrovert or we handling\nOkay now I think we were talking well anyway uh the older houses are now anywhere and used and there's a lot of houses fifty Seventy five years old Oh absolutely the heights is what I was trying to come up with I mean are they want to replace their doors it's been forty years houses settle\nThings change around and they're not square like they used to serve you and I\nI'm trying to tell you I think he's going to come out when it gets cold and it does get cold here said a year some time now to me it's going to have any ... that made it gets thirty five and forty in the wintertime truth yeah and I you know that's a lot of heat going out of there if the if there's an opening so it's good to check your doors absolutely you might need and it also makes that house more beautiful\nThat's right yeah there's there's no there's only positives by doing any kind of ... replacement you know you need to find the home you whether it's still the home and I mean there's just not and you can you help protect your contents on the inside because he's doors are much more difficult to get him than a standard or would be and the windows are the same way so\nSome of your competitors we won't mention them at a we're talking about the doors and in years come with hardware now I understand some people don't even up an argument that's extra price\nIs yeah that's yeah that's correct yeah most of the most of the doors that get installed in the Houston area it's a it's either a a box store bought door which will not come with hardware which the customer we're responsible for picking out of hard work for that and say or if you use our product we have a complete line of hardware sets you know anytime from a\nA lever handles to accented long handles to just single celled her door knobs I mean we got it all in all finishes and those come with the door and it's a slight products so it's a it's a well known a hardware\nAnd now these are factory products that you're mentioning yeah mostly now what's the delay is there a delay if somebody wants to order a few days but\nNo not as it is typical stained finish say that it would be probably on the long in of lead time and we'll be talking about four to five weeks\nOf um you know once we once we do an assessment or get a quote to the uh customer let them pick the style the colors or whatever it is if they want to pick on finish\nA hardware stuff like that we place in order for them takes three to four weeks to get it then we get our product sandwich check and make sure everything's ready and everything's right for the homeowner then we make contact with him again we schedule inflation day and if we take care of everything we're\nTalking about the windows and doors from vision window indoors and there are number you have a handing number to write this down to take three to four eighty three three to four nine three to four eight three three to four nights and that special again on the doors go ahead\nThat's a one side of a of a pre finished unit will do one side at no charge so that's like getting a free finished unit half price so it's a fish of exceptional deal and now you can also go look at us on our website we've got a ton of nice reviews on there\nExceptional deal and now you can also go look at us on our website we've got a ton of nice reviews on their um actually I saw a vision windows dot com no simple yeah and then you can uh you can kind of in that special also is is on there so you can\nGet let's get another look at it and get all the details or some little minor details but they're not the major and it really applies to just about every house that we visit\nSo if you need a door check into their website and they were going to get some deals here are on their doors as well as the windows or I have another question about the doors in the first show designed how is it [noise]\nSo the search on the line between a store bought door and the doors that we put in usually the store bought doors underneath our would finished our obey yes board one of the ones that we\nHave have a sub\nAt some floor of a composite underneath so you know doesn't absorb water it doesn't it doesn't get harmed by whether I'm kind of like that and it has a triple weather stripping underneath a door and the movable threshold adjustment\nAre they pretty or they heavy heavy doors are pretty solid doors oh yeah\nOh yeah yeah that said that line that I was talking about it's a a so all the rails in the style gone that are hardwood they're not they're not up for pine ... um so when you put one of these doors in it\nIt is so realistic when you open it it's almost like opening a solid mahogany door I mean there that real feeling compared to what product\nWhether you've heard they're saying that uh the door is only as good as its your jam right that the only one that got these one by too and they're going to break up care how good of a door you got in there they're going to snap that thing do you guys take care of that part of it too that they wanted a little more and strengthened up in this either but the what what do they use\nNow or ... I have no idea ... a lot of it depends on the ... the home okay so uh we have a process that we use ... will get a jam extension on it and there's some steps\nAnd we go over those were the cubs were at the time of the quote so we can help them understand you know a good quality jammed versus a regular you know for nine sixteenth jam which you would get from a box store versus a six and a half inch jam that you would get from us\nSo we can go from the interior of the house all the way to the final extra piece of brick mold and all and composite material where there was never rot never bugs and nothing will ever damage that stuff so it's kind of a a one and done type deal after\nAm I going to get near that are going to touch a ... I guess that's all right you're talking about the finishes on your doors what type of thing and she was are they again\nYou got paint finishes our oil finishes\nNow are either one can be ... down the line or the you know never have to pay these George\nI'm technically it depends on the the the door you buy but they have anywhere from seven to ten year warranty lawsuit him so I mean to be honest with you Twenty years down the road you probably won't even be able to tell that it's faded someone unless you have the sun beating on it\nUh yeah that's not bad at all what we got on let's get that I see this window and out the window specials are great you got the ah forty nine fifty special yep forty nine you want to go on from there\nYeah sure that's what it is it's a great specialist definitely we're talking about more than once it's a a forty nine fifty for two more knows and that's not just one does delivered to your house that's a complete installation\nOf those windows and then the special even gets better from that point on at three Seventy five per unit so that'll cover everything up to a hundred and eight United inches which equals a three foot by six foot window", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "28"}
