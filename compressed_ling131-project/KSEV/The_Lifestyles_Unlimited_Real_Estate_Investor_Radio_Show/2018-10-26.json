there's always working on your financial freedom today my friends have been knocking around an idea here my head's last day or two\nUh that I really want to try to parse out here if\nWe can get through it and that's basically this basic concept of ruins actually two concepts them try to weld them together but it's going to be a very tough well but I'm going to go ahead and try to mix them together and that is number one that we have been educated\nIn the poverty are public educational system\nHas trained to be basically employees train monkeys as it were\nMouse or going around all the you know the wheel everything you've always thought about the fact that you know they've trained us to work for them\nAnd the theory this comes out of the fact that the public educational system was created back during the industrial revolution because all of a sudden there was a need for it educated group of people to go into these\nEver growing job opportunities and fill up these factories and fill up these businesses with people that were smart enough to make things happen\nAnd so it served as point back then right but since the word has done is who's trained people\nOut of\nThinking mode and into sticking to a plan load that is basically that are being a trade multi and if you look at those should be thinking about what the\nYou think about what the public education system is teaching us it's starting with first of all stand in line\nSecond ball don't speak out in class you have to raise your hand to do anything you see their training is ripe for abuse that the boss is all powerful and we're just minions\nAnd then our ideas that our theories are not that useful\nBut they really want us to do is Cutler inside of the lines were taught to color inside of the lines and the copy what's already there\nIn other words but they're saying to us is is that if we're coloring horse the horse has got to be brown or white or black it can't be purple there is no purple horse out there and if you do it you're doing it wrong\nAnd so you can't think outside of the box you can't think or draw outside of the winds and so on critical thinking all creativity is being pounded out of his now some people get by and they're just so creative and comes out anyway but\nFor the most of us if there was any possibility\nOf us growing\nBoth in a creative side of our brain and in the functional side of our brain the right and left hemisphere is at the same time where we would come out to be the most useful to ourselves\nAnd maybe not society but to ourselves but I think even to society

the things that make the middle class possible we are being educated in to\nYes and I talked about the public education system ... now we're going to get the nanny state concept I'm basically\nYou know when you're used to work on your farm\nYou had a lot of kids because you knew you needed the kids to support the farm anybody got sick you need a lot of work lots of hands and if the you know the father died the kids have to take over and you know continue the farm or all the protection came the family\nBut when people started becoming a educated in the industrial revolution\nThey went away from the family they left the farms that came to the big cities they got these jobs and all of a sudden\nThe company was the nanny state everything was for the company you were a company man or you work because when the mayor and if you work the company man you're out in the cold they were going to get rid of you you're going to starve to death there was a real push for you to go there was no\nThere was no place for you to go there was no family to fall back on anymore and so you had to\nAssign yourself the belief system of the company man\nAnd you basically became it's late to the company's what it came down to end the working conditions were terrible and then there were unions and there was five and wars and you know they tried to make it better and it got better and all this liberal stuff to dig a better and better better to protect the worker and all that stuff is great except for one thing\nYou're still a call buddy man and when you were no longer a company man now you're a union man and so I'm not a company man I'm a union they're right and then\nWhen the unions got busted and companies couldn't afford to pay pensions of long term take care of people over the wall and younger people that were more educated were available for lower wages\nYou're out in the cold\nAnd so what they said well we're going to give you this belief system that you have to take care of yourself for the first time in your life or say there's no more pigeons you've got to go out there and started IRA and a four O. one K. and take care of yourself but the company will match you want some of that will back you on this will give you a place to invest\nBut you're still the nanny state you still out there at all eat out there if the company kept me around\nI Know what I went through

dad do which was to get a job and if you don't have enough money you get two jobs and my dad has worked as many as two jobs maybe even three jobs at a time to make ends meet\nThat should you have a

of being\nLiving a life for quite desperation\nNot being able to do critical thinking to make decisions for yourself to become successful because you've been trained both because of the nanny state concept that you deserve anything and everything you want even though you didn't do the right things to get them that you can do all the wrong things and still have those things that nanny state mentality is driven people to do crazy stuff\nAnd besides that they're not smart enough to figure out how to get out of the problem like I said would you for you know most people thirty minutes and solve\nA very large percentage of your problems in your life would have been doing for twenty seven years consulting people\nUm because you can't critically think you can't think outside of that box

you believe they have a singer educational system don't want you to leave him up since the government doesn't want you to believe you have options the Democrats don't want you to believe you have options\nEverybody out there is trying to keep you where they want you which is under the um the next article says basically\nFinancial stability doesn't necessarily mean having a high income so here we are back with another millennial writing another article saying financial stability doesn't necessarily mean having a high income guy goes on rights argument says okay what are the three things are most important about being funny how you define financial security right\nAnd a number one question when it came up with was\nBeing able to have a job and pay your bills and have enough money just to survive\nThat's it that's their thought process in this whole thing and then the guy goes out and says what would I don't understand is how did my grandma who was a widow living a tiny house\nFor most of her life since my grandfather died very early in his life\nAnd lived there without any income and survive and have a car repair bills and keep or help maintain how did she do that there is a process the millennials could get their arms\nAnd so they're asking what three questions you should ask yourself number one and you earn more than what your bills are from the second question that come up with is us six months worth of expenses for\nAn emergency right do you have six months were the expenses so if you lose your job or you could you survive for six months but what the heck happens if you get a terminal illness\nWhat happens if your job that they created goes out of business the reasonable you work from all bell there used to be land line telephones there are no land line telephones anymore you're done it's over\nWhat are you gonna do can you survive can you to retool your entire life and six months\nWhat happens if you get some kind of terminal injury\nSix months is going to be enough\nAnd the last one that you should ask is argue saving money for retire not the right question which is do you have a plan that will get you to retire but\nSo they're not asking any of the right question so I drew I Want to come up with some questions I thought you should ask a millennials to get the right question and I'm\nThe first question I have is are you sitting between twenty five and fifty percent of the money we're not thinking about this for a second\nWe have in our family reunion or whatever but we have all the kids over for the summer and we have three grown adult kids all three of which were with their parents their overhead is nothing\nAll three of which were with their parents their overhead is\nNothing nothing\nThey should be able to save tons of money it let's make very bad decisions\nAnd\nOr they go we have two of them that say tons of money and we have one that's very very bad decisions it does it have tons of money and if you think about it if you're living at home you know bills and all of a sudden you start making money can you not say half of that money\nEasily now was dog but if you can only four to six twenty five percent what did you take the ... instead of by yourself more TV more ... more cars or give yourself a wife at a bunch of kids are spending your my oldest so why don't you just\nGo buy some run out as as dark
