New Mexico ... takes us do Mexico hospice association and the advantage of remember some of these apps association says that they continuously have\nA girlfriend says they have ... almost on a weekly basis since about different topics\nAbout different things are going in the not only in their home health a hospice agency I mean a ... says but also about the different regulations that are changed by Medicare and believe me\nMedicare changed us regulations as often as you approach changed ... sure [noise] you know we have a a for instance they had a code for new things and so the diagnosis and they were to go when we started a business ... he was the ICD eight\nWe're already in the IT the pen and so by the time you learn how to use one of their systems fail already had darling you that they're going to change to another system that is better and improved so ... average changes so\nUh we we go to this conference that's how we take classes\nWhere you learn about the new changes how about the new laws we also interchange idea ... ideas we all their owners of agents of some form or the other older I mean as traders other nurses so we kind of learn from each other how to be be better in our what we do\nOkay a stay on the same subject about the insurance and and uh after our avatar you license to that avatar to do lab work uh for example the blood as and whatnot threatened\nAt a diagnostic lab until well we do have we have a special while they called the ... waver on this waiver is a certificate that allows you to have our nurses on our ... paperwork to to approach when I bought 'em edged to go to their patients Holmes\nPicked a blood sample Sunday urine samples out in the privacy of their patients home without having to go to I don't really\nI'm In the privacy of their patients home without having to go to I don't know if you've been to a to one of the it's a lot places you know I Need a fishing fleet has basically when you go to have a blood test or a blood test\nOr you have to go into one of his place as you said said on the waiting room when they call you you have to go into one of those ... recalls and\nUh you know beat out other people might be looking at the the technicians taking your broader and also\nI I that's come kind of an inconvenience justify they have to go some place outside of your home\nTo have this done when it actually tastes minutes for hours and hours to go to your home again in the privacy of your of your home they can draw their blood necessary grow like any other spectrum is how we need to collect a we take care of the rest you don't have to do anything else\nAre we what we do is we send it to the the the love of the doctor shortage whatever\nThe doctors give us an order centers to west diagnostic or a lot Corp I which are the two biggest once in a in actually in the United states and cats and we send samples for them\nAnd we make sure that the that the doctor ... quick I we also got the results and if we see anything that is not normal\nWe called the doctor's office to make sure that they're aware that there's something not right with a test so he he's a\nYou know it's very very convenient five and that's the whole scene of a home health is that convenience of getting the services that you normally would have to go to a hospital or to a\nClinic and get those services are home can anyone get them well no you're first of all you have to lead them so I Hope I Hope that they don't need 'em but oh no yeah but you have to you have to be ... you had there has to be a medical necessity\nNow that means that there's something that needs to be treated and\nAnd it could be as simple as not knowing what medications to take you knew you know Gary that the number\nIf I were to ask you what it's a number one killer of senior citizens in the United states what you're telling me\n[laughter] let's see why uh I Would say loneliness but they said that it once before and that wasn't the Asher I Do remember once before you go ahead I'm I'm all ears are okay well most people\nAre saying well his cancer is you know heart conditions know the number one killer\nSeniors in the United states is\nTaking the wrong medication or they gave voice sun by not take in the rye medication that right time or mixing medications that should not be taken at the same time\nOr taking too much or not taking in of show even something as simple as that\nNeeds to be addressed show it could be as simple as a nurse going through your home\nBoating all your medications and appealed box on telling you when you went to take it I'm ... and if you live with somebody else making sure that\nThat caretaker that person that at least with you also understands when and how you you're supposed to take your medications\nAnd why would happen if you take the medications in other words our nurses will teach you you know how to take and wants to take him even though the doctor already tall you but you know we forget stuff and like I say if you're taking I have with patients taking twenty different pills a day [noise]\nWho who can keep track\nOf that yes they say certain times of of others try maybe five and four hours at a secular get old so it it\nGets very ... so the nurse can go there on the issue I'll make sure I went to ... go out there to make sure that we keep track on you a ... it's so simple that's out or as complicated as let's say you have it wound that is no healing and\nYou need to have a one back with this this specialized machine to help\nA healer at will and so we our national ... from the very simple you know most basic health or you might need to the most complicated or help that you might need\nSo I'm not so then that's talking about nurses\nBut we also also Gary one thing that I was trading day\nI can you believe that if we can get you okay this is this this for Gary of if I can get you to to walk faster than you walk now\nDo you do would you believe if I tell you that there since eighty five percent chance\nThat you're going to live longer that if you walk in at the base how you walking now by walking faster by walking just by walking faster I'm On the treadmill every day for half our eye but the but that's good that's great but just by changing your shade just a little bit\nThat will increase\nYour blood circulation he would improve your a we'll give you a longer\nLife yeah lower your heart rate exactly so I I'm a disadvantage because I Am not a I'm not er nurse I'm not a doctor so when I get I don't want to get to take any calling to that but but I can tell you this and other service I got was home health\nIs occupational therapy on physical therapy so I you know as we get older which star loosen our violence and then what happens typically what happens is\nYou lose your balance so you lose self confidence you you're not a confident when you're walking so what happens is that what do you do you slow down by slowing down you become a more passive you becoming more sedative\nSo that means that that you brought some you know doesn't circulate as fast\nSo you're all ready to go with them if somebody calls up how long will it take before and of course weather related to when you show up I'm calling today where am I going to expect you\nKnow who to call today and he said an appointment for consultations we can get those

your host humor with the vision window and door is closer to a new window or\nWindows windows and uh our numbers to a one size by eight five Seventy three eight calling US Navy I missed out on the information and you have to be happy to answer some questions when went fast food alright five\nWhat is the difference between double hung and single hung out the window so yeah that's\nThe function of the window so typically and the huge scenario just about all the windows that are in homes currently are single hung which means just the bottom portion of the window is the functioning part of the window and you can replace those with a single hung model which would\nThe operation would be exactly like you have in the home now or you could go to a double hung window which means the top and the bottom moods we do a lot of double hung on sex\nYou know which means the top and the bottom moods we do a lot of double hung on second floor stories of cleaning so that takes the ladder out of the equation including hanging out inside the way I write\nSo that's a that's the primary a different set of single hung out a double Hong is just a function of the window at so I got\nYou know our guy on gas field or is that part of the wind the glass itself\nAh yeah well what they do is I pull a vacuum on the ... unit dance lay the glass unit once they have it prepared and then they were replaced the oxygen in the glass with the Oregon filler and it's just a dancer\nProduct in air itself what does it do and keeping them from breaking as easy as well not really didn't have anything to do is breaking it it's actually a more of a sound dinner and it also helps with any kind of compensation on the glass it helps reduce that greatly on the on the connotation\nOkay uh I'm not going to doors now are we mentioned storm doors infringed or tell us about those\nYeah we carry a we have a full line of a still an fiberglass central doors and aluminum storm doors um the storm doors you can get

the doors were what's that made a\nA Allen you want to help with the center of the extra doors so\nWe carry mostly to products still um which is a twenty gauge instill from pro via which normal front doors are twenty four gauge okay so it's actually more dense still you know harder to break harder to dance and stuff like that and then we also have a fiberglass which\nThey make everything is a hundred percent warranty on lifetime orange feed 'em paint up to ten years on the warranties um other than that I mean they I mean they speak for themselves what's\nA favorite among those things that we're talking about [noise] or is it doesn't\nReally hit it really has a little bit of that I had just depends I mean I Love the steel doors because they're more the more they have a heavier fields at them you know they and they just filled Ernie ... yes okay\nAll right uh what kind of options or do you have on your door products\nUm you can get anywhere from full glass half glass ... five uh five lights on the ... on the doors itself um you get triple locks system on the doors um you could do ... multi colored inside one color outside the other\nUm our fiberglass are actually they they
