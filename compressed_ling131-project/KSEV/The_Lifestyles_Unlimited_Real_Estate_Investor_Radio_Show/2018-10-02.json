dollars with distributions per quarter and a neighbor's companies rock star which she is a rock star\nSo if you want to break Robert I put a seat in your mind to think about how do you see the analytical position that we need to keep our lives and balance\nAnd do you try to keep your like rebels or do you just go for one thing to do next and just hack away it how do you work at it\nWhy they'd already the philosophical questions I and I didn't expect it but as I might go to my mind that that for\nA well goes way Robert\nRobert think of this you already accomplished more than any ten people out there you'd want to accomplish to speak to you about the intricacies of renting an apartment unit is a waste of time your mind is that needs to be probed\nAnd your mind is that needs to be probed we were scientifically going inside the mind of a super human being and figure out what it is in there that's why we're probing this way we want to know the world needs to know\nWhat makes Robert Martinez ticks will go ahead and pick it up how how do you see that idea of balance in your life what does it mean to you\nHave to find that get ready to hit a jar of water in a ... of the brain to abide by I appreciate that um I think from my experience I think what occurs balance is they is it again it's an individual definition and it changes with regularity I think\nIt you balance in your twenties balance your thirties or forties like I'm I'm I'm now and that maybe when you get your fifty to sixty which I'm not sure I I watch I'm not there yet uh uh but I think it change it I think at some point like for me like I have enough balance\nThat no matter what happens I'm going to be there for my children and when it got soccer and I might do these things that are important to me\nBecause it's important to them I got to have that time with them but I'm going to work during the day but as you said I'm not like on the day to day you know at least the apartments with my team anymore because past that point the ballots now I'm On the point of where all the Trump looking for ways to get ahead to stay ahead to you know youth\nTechnological advances but I I think your balance changes as you move through life\nYou know I think in the beginning you're grinding really really hard in your twenties\nAnd your thirties or you're you're you're a different you're in a different states you know so um I think these days\nMy balance I again I it has to do with my children first and making sure that that I'm there for them and you know a ice and read the coverage private conversations like short with wandering yesterday and it was so great to hear that had a conversation with them right but at the same time I you know I also have a responsibility to myself\nAnd and who you know the kind of that I Want to lead as well so\nI think some people are like they're they you know they can make forty thousand a year but they go to every one of their kids' soccer games ... neighborhood barbecues they can do all of that and they're perfectly happy you're going to have that can make three million dollars a year and are unhappy right\nYou've got to find a balance for you you've got to fight I don't think any one person can tell you this and that I think are bad and you find it for word that point in your life and and that's going to you that balance is going to help you get to the next one of your life and then you revisit and and you see or reset itself\nA different ballot have you\nFound out of your life help oh I I don't want to get into this I took the whole show up and we will be able to get to you or how do you [laughter] how do you fit health and fitness into your into your balance sheet\nFor sure so I discovered fitness or back in twenty tall and I
