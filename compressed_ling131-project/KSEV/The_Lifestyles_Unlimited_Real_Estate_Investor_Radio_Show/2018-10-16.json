sixty years age plus number of years that the corporation are retired and\nWe decided to of course ah you know a stock options or\nWe buy the stock and we'd make money on the income selling the options but when the recession hit our network was going down our equity and the deal was going down our our income where the\nStock price has gone so low on certain holidays that we weren't even able to fill the options anymore and Leo had been listening to Dale on the radio for a number of years and he suggested that we go and that we listen to um the presentation\nAnd lay out with his background in real estate he got it he said this is the real deal I'm ready to join and I just wasn't quite there yet because\nYou know the stock options didn't turn out ultimately the way that we thought that they would we were looking for something long term and then we did a little bit of tax playing investing which we learned a lot but that didn't turn out the way that we thought it was going to so he was ready to join and\nSo he kept saying we're going to join\nAnd and that's fine ... that was the final word and I said well I I Need to you know research this because it was over the Christmas
