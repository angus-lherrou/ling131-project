limited rules to invest a radio show I'm your host Del Walters Williams always working on your financial freedom today my friends\nI Want to talk to you about the six ways to make money real estate\nAnd\nThere's a show ... out of a conversation I had the as I went out with the way she wanted to talk about what to do with a large sum of money because she just close on a real estate deal made quite a bit of money\nAnd she\nTrying to figure out what to do it you know until she could root for the money back into real estate and the conversation was rather interesting other low level if you think about it uh basically what would you do with your money\nWell as I started spending time with her the one thing that we very quickly brought up and she agreed to was a you don't want the money\nSitting in something where they could go out and do you or be you can't get through it with a good deal comes it has to be liquid than it has to be safe so she looked through\nThe deal comes it has to be liquid and it has to be safe so she looked in savings accounts and it's you know most soon as it comes out there right now less than half a percent\nShooting found one that the guy had found her that was a one point eight percent return\nWhich is about three times that of what the national average is for saving scouts\nAnd she said what do I think about that that's fine I said that's not bad I've got some cheaper set some in one point nine five some at one point nine one point eight five and I gave all those accounts or those savings\nCompanies are actually banks with it were and I said you know you can put your money in there and there's another concern and the second concern is is your money insured safe and the FDIC insurance coverage of the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per account\nSo if you got a very large lump of money and you're going to stick it in one account it's not going to be covered so we had discussed the strategy and I said well first of all you need to understand\nThat insurance covers two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per beneficiary on the account\nSo if you put you and your husband on the account that's going to get you five hundred thousand dollars\nOf FDIC insurance so she goes well that's not what they told me and I said well\nI understand that go back and talk to him down and have them look it up have their attorneys look it up because that's the way it was explained to me and I said the way they explained to me is you could have up to for beneficiaries so you could have you your husband and two kids\nI'm any errant

you more money than any other investors first of all we covered with captured equity and where we went through the concept that you know when captured equity you can make instantly the is that you bought a piece of real estate\nAnywhere from you know twenty five fifty\nA hundred two hundred four hundred percent return we see them all it's unbelievable way to make money and no other investment out there that we know you\nCan make money by buying something and simply buying it making money just because you bought it well below what it's worth can't do that in the stock market share to that and the bond market can't do that in anything else uh other than maybe a business or something like that\nThe second one is what really attracted me to real estate in the first place the the major reason I saw that with cash flow as for the for the life of me I just really like to know how\nWe get completely brainwashed in this country to believe the cash or doesn't mean anything what convinced you is it you should give them your\nMoney put it in your four one K. put it in the rye or re put it in the stock\nPut it in your four one K. put it in the rye or re put it in the stock market putting your financial planners portfolio\nAnd let them make money with it\nAnd they said well I'm making money with no you're not getting paid anything they're getting paid paycheck each week go home and live off that money\nThey're making money but you're not getting paid anything they've got your money doing something with it that's making them rich or was names that rich because they're probably not even rigid upon discipline but they're making a living off of it\nBut your money is not making you living at all in any way shape or form they got to think about that right\nSo what is your money earning you what is it bringing you and I would do this thing in my class were asked people to write down how much cash income they earned last year and most people look at me like what\n\nWhere do you mean hosted a well how much should you actually get what checks came to your house that you did nothing for there was no employment involved anywhere along the way\nAnd most people just can't even begin to appreciate that there should be ... does your four one K. pay you know it does you pay it can you imagine\nIf I told you what I Want you to do is buy a house [noise]\nTo pay the mortgage payments every month for Thirty years so that some day the house will be paid off an which is basically a ... term for paid off the funded you will funded dolls and hopefully the house will go up in value\nAnd you say well I Would never do that why would I Do that stupid sick then what do you do with your four one K. you're paying into it for Thirty years to fund it you're receiving no cash flow whatsoever\nAnd the the under Thirty years you're hoping that it's worth more than what you did it for that has some way shape or form and has appreciative value\nThat's what you're looking for right\nYou'd never do that with a house I Would hope now so you might be dumb enough to do that some of you have done that you bought a second hole for yourself a vacation home for yourself you bought a whole for your kid to live in and bought a home for your mother to live in and somehow you rationalize yourself that makes sense\nDoesn't make sense at all you need income producing assets you can't retire unless you are able to produce enough cash flow to replace you earned income just because you stop working doesn't mean you're going to stop spending\nUnique cash flow to retire it's the most important part of an investment in most investments do pay hardly anything\nAt all no was look at the ones who do some stock preview of it it's not very many but some productivity is a very high and it's not guaranteed they may say no distribution lists that I'm bonds not very high right now\nCDs not very high right now savings accounts that very hard right now you should be a person can retire with a million dollars they buy bonds or CDs or ten or Fifteen Percent of those who should say ten and that was a hundred thousand dollars a year\nNow the only one or two percent that's not enough to retire on so where's the casual\nNow we're speaking with this lady the other night we were talking about you know it's funny\nYou love showing your piece of real estate making a match to gain and having all this money but then you very quickly realized that having all this money sitting there in a counter interest isn't paying you even anywhere close to how much the beach real estate was paying you every month\nShe had a massive game but you have a loss in income so you immediately want to deploy this money back out as quickly as you can into something that's going to earn more money\nSo if the cash flow of that you already right now is either zero for J I re personal residents for something else he did the what I get that money making some money will take a short break be right back lifestyles are limited real that he does the radio show [noise]\n\nYou know that every job would you invest in real estate makes you money by waves cash flow of money in your pocket money

today and for arming I'm seven hundred can see the boom voice from Texas [noise]\nOnce I realized I was a little bit of the lesser radio show and they were discussing the six ways of real estate makes you more money\nThan any other investors\nRight now we're on a we just covered number four which is for supervision for those used to eating in the first four were captured equity which we said you know make hundreds of percent return on that a cash flow gonna make a mid uh say\nSeven eight percent up to as much as twenty five percent on that force depreciation a again over a hundred percent return it done correctly a now we're talking about capital gains and the ability to refinance out the capital gains\nAre with no taxes so we're talking getting into tax cuts which is now the situation so when you look at a property we force it's appreciation or it has appreciation I'm now we have a gain in value\nNormally to get the game and value on most things you have to sell them to get the game that right so if you're in that case you lose the asset itself and you lose the cash flow and you lose any other appreciation in the future\nYou're giving away the goose laid the gold make\nRight but what we're doing is completely different we're going down to the baggage saying give us a new loan for a larger about because the property is not worth much more and we were to borrow up the difference so let's say the property was worth a million dollars\nWe increase its rental income by ten percent which falls to the bottom line as a twenty five to thirty percent increase in income\nWhich then in turn triggers a\nTwenty five percent\nIncrease in value which in turn we can go back to the back and say we want an eighty percent loan of and we pulled eighty percent loan out so this property was a million dollars worth a million three hundred thousand we get a new loan for a million fifty we pull out two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nNow we put down two hundred thousand but we are closing costs of fifty thousand so we basically of pull back out tax free all the money we invested in the deal\nThat you think about that you can't do they get back to the doctor who care about a hundred thousand over the stock last year I'd like to get that money back and still owns stock\nHow did they do that they can't do that for you and even if they did which they had a lead bridger bowl account let's say you had the ability in your plan your financial plan to pull out a loan against your stocks right to leverage in stocks\nWho would pay the payments on that loan see when we pull out this new money on the apartment complex or the house are tenets are paying that loan\nBecause the increase in income is how we can get the loan because the increase in income will allow us to have to pay the increase in the\nMortgage payment that you could go borrow money to get your other assets but you'd have to pay it back we're borrowing out there's equity and we're not paying that\nWe have no intention to pay it back it's not a short term loans it's personal signature loan it's alone against the properties what's called non recourse I mean the property is\nThe collateral and the company the L. O. C. that owns the property is the signature on the low and if the whole thing goes belly up they can't come back after we've already pulled over money back out of the deal by refinancing it out\nBut we're still on the property we still on the cash flow we still own any additional appreciation or future capital gains we retain all the ownership rights\nWe'll games we retain all the ownership rights ... we pull our investment out\nNow in the stock market they called is playing with house money\nAnd the way you would do that with house money is that you would wake you stocks went up by you know a hundred percent of thinking about it because there's no leverage is ... your ... your ... your stocks have to go up a hundred percent and if they go up a hundred percent now you have two hundred percent of what you bought and you just sell half of it\nNow the problem with that is that when you sell half of it you have a capital game now you have to pay taxes and all that we're pulling his money out we're not paying taxes on it all\nYou're paying taxes on them and secondly you've lost half the stock she'll be earning power of the ... has been diminished by half we used to all all the apartment complex\nThe earning power has not been diminished at all\nThis is the difference between becoming rich or just retiring saving for your retirement this is how you become a multimillionaire\nYou're making these kinds of moves the kinds of moves you just can't make with the conventional investments that you've been doing your entire life will take a short break\nFinish last segment on the tax benefits real estate and how they will affect your growth and come right back lifestyles are limited ... radio show [noise]\n\n\n[noise] we know you're out in hiding in plain sight really on my wife desperation wondering if you're going to be your money through the green there isn't a better way of federal wife lifestyles unlimited you'd find a liberal life you deserve you can only do that by creating half his income\nBut a show you how it's just a few hours you can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or none of mine was making fun of TV shows do you why you see Dr ... mask you I used in shock\nAs your business been hit hard by the ever changing economy let the power of radio help expand your business KFC me rage of a vast audience stretching from east Texas to Austin it down to the coast advertising on radio provide you with the opportunity to reach the key clientele you've always wanted the sales team\nAt KFC they can put together a marketing plan that suture growing business including targeted at play Smith show remote and promotion on the KFC the website to sit down with one of our professional inexperienced sales staff call to wait one five eight eight forty eight hundred\nThat the damn Patrick from my friend Lewis florrie\nJudo hurricane season is here and that can bring storms on strong winds and let's not forget the damage that strong winds can cause to your big valuable trade you don't want to lose them and you don't want anything damaged below them one of the branches false\nThat's why you need to call my friend Louis for weeks\nAnd a building tree experts I've known them for Thirty years it's time to deep rooted feed your trees to help with this dress Lewis glory inability tree experts knows this is the perfect time to prune and remove the dead wood in your trees\nVisual send them out and help with the stress bores beetles and other insects are going to be drawn to your week trees to treat you need to be sprayed to prevent these insects from attacking so call ability tree expert situate one for for one for one Seventy nine\nFeet of the experts were all of your tree needs ability trees is giving a deeper feeding with every tree prone Paul ability tree experts will tend to have one for for one for one seven nine", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tomball", "day": "05"}
