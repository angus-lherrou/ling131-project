I don't have the knowledge sack number but I Would say you have to follow like said all you have to be under the poverty line level which is like twenty thousand dollars a year or something like that [noise]\nBut if you if you qualify for if you are a Medicaid recipient if you get food stamps is you get supplemental income if you get any other kind of help from the state or the federal government there would not allow you to change any time during the year\nThat includes SSI disability or should I say\nWell no Social Security that's your retirement no Social Security but any kind of sub prime anthology any extra or you will probably qualify and so when you want to change insurance since\nThey ask you if you if you're doing it outside of the enrollment period then they're going to last year this five questions senators sake to yet yes to any of those you're going to be able to switch but again\nIn my experience all the people with low income can really do that so they sound vanished that\nYou have a website or under a tourist higher number of course you can call me out to add one Seventy eight fifty long research it a little bit all you're looking for sure brought to our car\nAbout a V.

you can go to Houston window experts dot com and you can do that twenty four seven and my right to say that\nYeah in fact I tell you what's interesting we have a lot of our um\nClients tell us that they started off on the website [noise]\nHouston window experts dot com and and you know the the pages on our website you know how you can track your website and see what are what are people reading

before my windows it's really informative it's not geared to sell windows is geared to inform\nAnd of course there by an educated Myers is always a happier by right because they they make the right decision the first time\nAnd you're going to let us You're going to make us go to the website you're not going to tell us what the [laughter] you got to be saying\nYeah OK well let me tell you one of them okay I'll tell you one of okay um\nYou know there's there's two things you can do wrong um when my windows lenders overspend\nNow and the other is understand that and and I go into some detail on that you know that I had a guy one time he said Jeff I'm looking for the cheapest window money can buy as well congratulations and it's a really as I said yeah you've already got it it's the window that came with your house it's free you know [laughter]\nWell yeah if you're looking for a cheap ah that can be a mistake and if you're judging a window by how expensive it is a there is some merit to that right I mean if I had a fifty thousand dollar Bentley you would be suspicious of why is it so cheap or because we all know Bentley's don't cost fifty thousand dollars but on the other hand who just spending money to spend money\nDoesn't mean you're going to get more window for that for a ride speaking of money if you ask how much it is and you really can't afford it anyway so fell there can be some truth to that but I Will say that most people you know you heard that saying that you get what you pay for yeah I I Want to I Want to add to that by saying you get what you pay for and sometimes less\nYou know there are times when you think you're paying for something that's great and you actually don't get it and and that can lead to disappointment\nWe're talking to Jeff Louis used in window experts is the name of the company and we're talking windows uh today our windows jets for difficult to install\nOh yeah ... yeah in fact I'm of all the home improvement projects their stats that show that um the the one people don't want to do the most is two months flooring\nHave you ever done that if you ever tried to work on that and then and hanging adores another one I say well hey you know there are big heavy entrance oh I thought it was a ... not that easy yeah I we get I Would say at least a couple of customers a week\nTo call us out because I had a failed window installation project and uh\nI kind of like the joke and say people say ... can I start my own windows answers yeah can you cut your own hair which are you can but you want to you know can you do your own root canal well I guess you could but you really want to\nAnd so I'm not saying it's tough I mean there's a lot of great window installing companies here in Houston yeah but it's not a typical homeowner do it yourself type project you got a square\nThere I mean there's so many things involved in it anyway well and getting the window out the hardest part I'm you know if if if somebody came and did all the taken out the window for you without damaging your house then yeah you probably you know I can do it\nWhile how long can a homeowner expect a new window to last what is a guarantee on on the windows\nWell you know most window companies now they're they're they're warranties are so strong it really will outlast your mortgage I'm fairly yeah window Sunday or being designed to to have about thirty to fifty year life expectancy and I know that sounds really short you know if you're living in the Nineteen twenty six\nPier and being house over in the heights right now you've got a hundred year old windows in your house you don't you ... you know we got admitted ... things aren't built today like they were a hundred years ago um those beautiful hundred year old windows while they may have lasted a long time they're terribly inefficient they sweat and they leak and it's well he can open 'em and [noise]\nBut but today's windows are built with with quality of mine\nBut they are dealing with about a thirty to fifty are expected lifespan when when he's when a company and say you got a lifetime warranty you know here's another tip for you when you say you got a lifetime warranty there they've got an actuarial department is doing the math\nAnd they they know that the American average homeowner now stays in her home for about seven and a half years\nSo in reality they're looking at it like yeah well there's going to be one guy who has a twenty year lifespan in his home is going to be another guy there for two years but if we average it all out if we if our window can survive seven and a half years or golden and on and that could be the way they approach it so it's more important than looking at warranty is\nThe quality of the materials used the quality of the glass the workman ship but the installer\nAnd and then the warranty serves as a net net as your primary source for for guarantee of success and\nYou're you're talking about energy efficient I guess even in those houses and homes and the heights that are a hundred years old and the windows of them are probably are as old as a house yeah a lot of you know if they get new windows put her I bet you to shave and thirty or forty percent when there's always when there's a replaced\nWell you know that it causes them yeah that that is in fact if you visit and I and I love this website it's worth going to an Energy Star dot Gov if you've ever been to Energy Star dot Gov you'll read they have a lot of different stats on efficiency in one of them I I thought I was just shocked by the number they said if you have single pain windows in your home today", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Tomball", "day": "14"}
