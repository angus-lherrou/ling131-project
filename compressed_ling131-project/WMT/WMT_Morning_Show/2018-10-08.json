outer lucky and you can get to them soon you can get the filled once we will take a buyout bathroom break out of the half hour mark\nAnd of course I'm actually going to send a link out all your guys okay so everybody will be on the same page as to what we are talking about in terms of river levels and everything over the next week to ten days um the Army Corps of engineers will be updating their forecast around mid morning I'm the core of the lake is going to be\nReally getting close um to really having a big big problem um with the river basin being as high as it is also the cedar river basin coming up as high as it is the English river as high end in the Mississippi south of the quad cities is going to be approaching major flood category so\nI'm the corps of engineers that ... that you're in a very delicate balance right now as to how to control their water coming through 'em\nSo we'll see winds up happening there um but the very latest outlook right now still suggest that we're going to have periodic bouts of rain in the area for today or the aerial flood warning that was in place for Johnson county it's been trimmed back to a very small area um but it is still there in fact in southern sections of Johnson county is where it's at right now\nUm and what it's really covering is a areas and creeks and streams that are flowing into the Iowa river downstream of the core build them there's some flooding in that part of the county so would you want you to be very aware of that moving forward\nStorms with heavy rainfall today and localized flash flooding normally wouldn't call for that\nI'm In a situation like this though the ground is so so soaking wet that everything is literally running off very quickly we actually saw some rises on creeks and streams yesterday even with just light tomato range so that kind of gives you an indication of how much is running off\nSecond this front is stalled largely from about Des Moines to about ... what we expect where this front is going to be towards the afternoon hours and so that's going to probably be the access to some of the heavy rainfall amounts and\nIf this pattern continues like it has the past few days what you're going to notice is a subtle southeast shift on some of the highest rainfall amounts and thought you know north central central Iowa there you're going to get walloped\nWith rainfall but also a farther south east shift over time so I think we're gonna get plenty of rain and are listening areas well Seventy six year high today sixty five night it's a repeat of tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow night same thing ... generally mid to upper seventies lows back into the mid to upper fifties Wednesday storms are likely mainly through mid day\nFalling afternoon temperatures it'll turn windy on Wednesdays the cold front blows through Ohio around sixty though that could be off by five degrees give or take based on how fast is cold front will push across\nAnd by the time we get the Thursday we're mostly sunny and windy cold cooler than and at least it's a dry day I around forty nine after that there are two more areas of low pressure each for friday and Saturday right now there's no sign of widespread heavy rainfall but\nThere's at least another rain chance in there when it comes down to the river levels that were going to be looking at here\nAre the cedar river has got flood warnings issued along it right now and it's not necessarily a short term situation more of a long term situation here\nAnd this does take into account one to two inches of rainfall falling into the basin and generally running off at Waterloo expecting a sixteen point eight foot crest sometime on friday\nAnd at Cedar Rapids forecasting he's sixteen point four foot crest sometime later this weekend\nI Will tell you though that there are ... to this and one\nIs that we're seeing more runoff than usual because of saturated soil and also the fact that the crops really aren't transpiring as effectively as you would see in the summer because the crops don't really want to be out there anymore they'd they'd rather be harvested and being sold\n'em so we're not seeing a lot of absorption anywhere so a lot of this is going into the base and and this assumes that models are right\nSo far the past three days they've been right only on the occurrence of rain they have not been correct on the placement of rain or the timing of rain\nSo that's where things are very much in flux here and so we really encourage you to keep plugged in we'll give you updates as we go now and again I'm going to send you guys are linked to I've kind of everything and that's the same link that goes to the general public because if you go to our app\nYou can see river levels checked them here I'm going to send you guys at the radio station the same link so everybody's on the same page as to what's going on because we're not going to deviate from what the National Weather services forecasting along the river that's just not responsible\nSo we're going to just stay right with their messaging and we're going to have some flooding concerns unfortunately and ultimately a lot of runoff five point seven inches of rain so far in October for Iowa City\nThe average in the first week of October is zero point six wildly ten times the average amount of rainfall for the first week of October and therefore that's the impact you get I mean when it's this wet around here coming up such a wet September\nI mean you're bound to have trouble so we'll see what happens that ultimately all depends as obvious as it sounds as to where some of the heaviest rainfall and how fast does that route its way down the basin or fifty four right now what a loose sixty four solid ten degrees warmer at Cedar Rapids sixty six now and I would say\nOkay what what did you get a rain amount to to have you been able to pull that together\nAnd it's been very scattered um I Know Xavier was it about two thirds of an inch last I checked a

morning at nine thirty right nine forty nine point forty okay and uh that is presented by firehouse subs it's currently sixty five and eight o'clock\n[noise] these these news radio six hundred down when you empty Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nPeople complained it was a dangerous spot I'm Chris foster Fox News and the national Transportation Safety board's investigating an accident that killed all Eighteen people in a limousine into ... more from Fox is Evan brown\nLifting in from the south and there's going to be some more scattered activity as his day goes on some heavier activity in North central sections of Missouri right now that's moving generally north northeast and right now if it stays on its current path they would cut basically through\nLet's say pow she county just North West of Vinton through about independence is going to be where that access as heavy rain would be so ultimately falling in in all of our basins and so that's why we're probably going to looking at some river flooding even well after this what pattern is over with\nSeventy six the high today humidity is up right now do points are climbing in the sixties and an overall definitely feels out of season\nEnded most definitely is sixty five the low for tonight and as we go into some moral showers and storms are likely heavy rainfall may company anything again that forms tomorrow a high right around Seventy seven looks like the whole pattern clears out by Wednesday afternoon with at least the rainfall so\nAs it comes down to the river forecasts that are being issued right now are taking into account this rainfall but ultimately it's taking into account modeled rainfall\nWhere actually falls is another story because the forecast models this entire time\nHave shown plenty of error because it's out of season um the fact that the rain chances have been so high that's been verified but these little bulls eyes of really heavy rain have moved around Iowa City west branch you got a friday night Saturday\nI'm at a bull's eyes heavy rain last night Cedar Rapids down to Iowa City and we'll see where it today in tonight tomorrow's goes where we could have some localized flood problems and ultimately if it falls in the basin or whatever basing it might be might be the Iowa might be the opposite I mean we'll we'll figure it out as we get closer so these numbers will adjust and they will fluctuate\nBut hopefully by Wednesday afternoon when all the rainfall is measured and accounted for and not a whole lot of future rainfall to come at that point\nUh we can get a better handle on what these rivers may actually be capable of at that point Wednesday also a day of falling temperatures later high in the morning then fall through the afternoon temperatures on Thursday down to the upper forties it'll be mostly sunny and windy and by the end of this week we'll probably have a frost somewhere in Iowa at least try the northern two thirds of frost\nAs temperatures do fall back to the low to mid thirties\nFor the river gauges right now\nI'm aside from what's that core villa lake which again will be updated again later on here today\nOr what's been going on with these river levels around the area of the preliminary forecast that were issued I logged on for a brief time yesterday and saw a number and I logged on again today and I saw a different number and what will probably happen is if you log on this afternoon and see a different number\nAnd that's going to be the way this thing goes right now as it stands the latest forecast is for sixteen points four feet in Cedar Rapids by Sunday\nCould that fluctuate absolutely it probably will um we'll see if it may speed up we'll see if it might be delayed we'll see if it comes up from their down from there but\nThe bottom line is it's very high confidence that the seat or will come up same story at Waterloo where it's currently at nine point five it's actually forecasting or it's actually following that graph perfectly right now I'm sixteen point eight foot by the time we get the friday\nSo it does take into account another inch or two of rainfall but ultimately if it falls and unfortunate places than these values may change sometimes significantly so a lot to pay attention to Randy in the coming days the English river clone or right now is at Nineteen point six feet\nThat as an October record 'em that as of seven o'clock and it's still continue to hold its own right now\nThe Iowa river near lone tree\nThat's downstream obviously of core villa lake and so there are some other creeks and streams that are having an impact on that Nineteen point six that's firmly in major flood category for the ... river near lone tree and then further down the line the Iowa river Columbus junction also firmly in major floods status at twenty four point one\nAnd the weather service anticipates that school about another half a foot\nBetween now and sometime tomorrow morning so I'm we'll see we'll see how all this moves uh there's also going to be a hurricane and Florida this week\nThere is a one right now at the tropical storm that's just to the east of the Yucatan around Mexico and the current path of Michael is going to be up into the Gulf of Mexico and I tell you this one is kind of sneaking in quickly because um it's a it was just a little area of disturbed weather just three or four days ago\nNow become a tropical cyclone and based on the national hurricane data\nA National Hurricane center forecast there was a snippet in their discussion this morning that said would not be surprised to see something along the lines of strengthening to major hurricane status so they've got it as a strong category to coming into the panhandle of Florida sometime Wednesday and um we'll see we'll see what that does um\nSo between our flood problems that are ... problems and Florida getting hit again and the Carolinas ultimately get some residual rainfall from that\nUm it lots to talk about ranting yeah a lot of things happening here I Would imagine if Michael becomes a hurricane or anything like that hits the golf a lot of times\nThey will curl up in effect Iowa or whether to so um if they hit the western Gulf yeah to hit the eastern Gulf what they might do is kind of served a sweep out this pattern which will actually help to keep our cold front moving\nThat would be the good part at least driest south Thursday and maybe most friday\nUm some data still suggesting some rain around Saturday though and if that is going to be happening then that could be what's leftover of hurricane Sergio which is an east Eastern Pacific right now and so there's that that we also have to keep an eye on is the approach that we can\nI help for our sake locally that can just go in the northern Missouri a but we'll see they'll get lots of things to watch for you Randy hurricanes not just for the Gulf Coast anymore [laughter]\nOr two in a row and I I tell you what if you talk about or Arizona rainfall they've added it again and get it again down there yeah and that is really something if if you don't think the desert can flood think again writing out we saw a lot of big video down there last week when Rosa went through there\nAnd now you're going to have Sergio going through there and they're going to have some flood problems down in Arizona so I I was talking with Justin last week\nFor the desert when they have flush flooding there should be some kind of conversion chart because people are in Iowa are saying that got two thirds of an inch and they flooded well huh that's just their landscape bill it's just the way it is you know and unfortunately two thirds of an inch up here\nIs also going to run an awful lot of just how it went with them and I watch and even some of the river levels right now that have jumped\nWith last night's simple inch of rain and so much less of the pile on two or three of the time then you wind up getting a bigger problem so we'll see we'll keep informed okay thanks a lot of time British it all the weather information coming from or whether partner TV nine news radio six hundred double
