in a non invasive way\nAnd what they found is that the brain you have to work harder to keep us\nFrom being sedentary so there may be some hard wiring to being what we you know putting in air quotes

be more efficient when\nAvoiding predators or searching for food and shelter or even competing for sexual partners so another way of saying that that that there is an evolutionary answer as to why the brain is hardwired this way of minimizing our energy caught gave\nUs an advantage for survival which clearly doesn't apply to today as most people aren't in a crisis situation for survival

incentivize people to stay active and eat nutritious food so that we can have a healthy productive society and I think\nYou know if if maybe we can re why are we train our our brain um\nThat'd be

catch up with him on this morning morning CERN\nActually you guys ever had one of those mornings where you could just you know this is probably an obvious question where you could just use ten minutes ago yup just ten minutes to get yourself back on track uh that's kinda where we're at here this morning in a uh doing some river flooding and things like that but a Nineteen point to nine\nIs going to be the crust level and likely at Manchester it's been falling now the past few hours and uh that gauge reports every Fifteen minutes a Nineteen point to nine was the highest it went um we'll see if the weather service says different but I have to think it's gonna be very close to that you guys know what the previous October record was\nUm sixteen points for lower fourteen point to lower eleven\nWhy our forests eight point three one oh wow wedding is not supposed to happen this time of year I Know it's just the fact of it and that's why a lot of times you don't hear about you know school closures due to flooding because it doesn't tend to happen but now\nI'm this is a pattern that really really looks troubling for very heavy rainfall around the Midwest now today we get a bit of a break and not necessarily from from a ton of rain uh because we are dealing with some shower activity across the area and there are some showers every southwest I went back in the south central Nebraska also pockets of drizzle\nSo they're they're showing up and we can see it on the camera network as well um Cedar Rapids north camera has some bits of drizzle coming out at the same story with north liberty Iowa City core avail\nI'm also some fog around the Tipton area so uh there is plenty forced to watch for today in terms of just residual moisture but not enough that's really going to be to measurable around here high temperatures be tricky probably ... over the north\nLow sixties farther down to the south that's also a low for tonight as temperatures look to rise once we get past midnight some scattered showers around tonight down to the upper fifties low sixties probably around the mid sixties by this time tomorrow\nAnd then everything is still pointing at some warm for tomorrow upper seventies over northern Iowa low eighties farther down to the south breezy and milder\nThat wind up from the south that twenty to thirty and there will be a good chance of scattered thunderstorms late in the afternoon and especially into the evening hours and some of those can be strong to severe with very heavy rainfall potential to a company that right behind the front is going to get cold tomorrow night mid to upper forties for our lowest by the time we get up and going on Thursday morning\nAnd Thursday right now is really looking like a garbage day here um northeast wins probably at least ten to twenty coming at us and then there's another system that's coming in from the south and west and the thing that's interesting about this as you think to yourself northeast wind\nYet the rainfall is moving south west in northeast how can that happen well it has to do with how these things are being steered\nAnd in the mid levels of the atmosphere the wind can blow in a drastically different direction than your these systems into a colder air masks when that happens it squeezes out whatever moisture can and create some rain shower so I'd be looking for some of those showers maybe a thunderstorm in the afternoon and evening a cool fifty five on Thursday\nBack to the sixties again on friday and essentially what we're doing today\nIs as we move our way forward in the extended\nShowers and storms are likely friday Sunday Monday Tuesday possibly Wednesday of next week and uh the only real dry periods in here um could be Saturday morning\nAnd then again sometime late next week but the problem is a one of the latest models as far as that goes out\nAnd what we're doing is looking at the large scale pet or not so much these finer details because find details can't be resolved with any kind of confidence that distance but the large scale pattern looks like it's going to continue through at least October fifteenth\nWhich would take it all the way through the second week of October and all the way through another three or four days of the forecast here so it looks like a very wet pattern here all the way through that timeframe maybe a little cooler\nTowards next week in general but uh it's a real real wet pattern around here are pretty much a slam dunk that we're going to see some record rainfall over portions of Iowa just tough to tell exactly where my my ... would say north central in northeast Ohio because we still have that big head start in terms of\nUh getting to those record numbers already to the north or farther down to the south may be a little bit less but you know the whole state in general is going to deal with a lot of rain over the next seven to ten days unfortunately we'll see what happens here were forty eight

in the FBI is Brett Kavanaugh investigation I'm Dave Anthony Fox News the FBI\nShould be able to interview anyone anyone appropriate\nTomorrow I'll tell you that the high temperatures are still challenging but with with every forecast models pushing eighty\nWe're going to go with it a ... upper seventies north to low eighties farther down to the south um all the data is pointing towards about a six hour spike in temperature and then it goes right back down again now even if the clouds are hanging on tight Justin made this observation this past weekend\nOr that it was mostly cloudy and central Missouri and they still had upper seventies so it can still probably get that warm if you just kind of force the year up here so\nSouth winded twenty to thirty miles an hour that's enough to kind of force our temperatures up a bit\nBut more importantly it's going to bring more moisture up in here do points right around Seventy degrees a record amount of atmosphere moisture for this front to work with for late tomorrow into tomorrow night so inherently we're going to have to forecast for heavy rain and also for risk for some strongest severe thunderstorms then right behind it the wind trends right back around to the north Fifteen to twenty five\nA low tomorrow night down to forty nine Thursday\nProbably probably a dry morning we'll see but probably it's mainly in the afternoon and evening that rainfall returns the higher on fifty five degrees Thursday is not going to be all that pleasant of the day we've got a northeast when that's pulling in and that's what's going to keep the temperatures down but all the while\nThe wins that actually steer these low pressure systems they're located about twenty thousand feet up\nAnd so a lot of times people wonder well how can a area of rain and moved to the northeast when the wind is blowing exactly the opposite of that\nWell it all has to do with what the mid level winds are doing and where they're being pushed and so what's gonna happen is that cool air under cuts the moisture what does that do condense is it out makes rain\nAnd makes for an overall unpleasant day or so that's when we were looking for on Thursday especially the afternoon and evening\nFriday scattered showers and storms are likely temperatures made bounce around a little bit compared to what we have out there but it looks like some sixties are probably pretty reasonable for highs and sixties as long as this weather pattern continues is probably a reasonable estimate with each passing day\nBiggest problem is going to be additional river flooding as work our way forward\nAnd uh also increasing soil moisture content which is going to be a problem going into the wintertime obviously to\nOffset some people have to keep an eye on Waterloo officially over two inches of rain yesterday to use that a daily record for rainfall for October first one point three eight and a Cedar Rapids Iowa City not as much this go round um but again it's it's a pretty heavy pattern that we've got in front of us here\nWith a lot of rain chances on the way let's quickly run down a few of the rivers right now because we do have some of those numbers to deal with your\nUh first off Manchester has crusted\nThat's the good part um it is falling right now it's not necessarily the fastest fall but it should come down fairly quickly today a way to get the smaller base and and so it looks like it'll probably go below flood stage probably by this evening which is good news is down a foot\nFrom where it was earlier in the overnight a crust of the Nineteen point to nine that breaks the old record of eight point three one\nIn October so a huge crush their in Manchester and that's eventually rolling down the stream towards the coca Atmeh coca which will get up to moderate flood category at twenty five point eight feet by the time we get to Thursday morning\nThe ... at independence right now appears to be getting close to its crush point at Thirteen point to and then it'll be rolling down the base and towards the animal so what's the latest update out of Anna most uh\nIs going up to Seventeen point eight feet some time on Thursday morning\nUp in the black hawk county the black hawk creek which is up in Hudson that's where the gauges added said Fifteen point nine feet right now and still rising the forecast was for it to stop at sixteen tonight we'll see what happens it did may exceed forecast a little bit\nUh the cedar river Waterloo is also slightly above forecast at this time a further down to the south toward Cedar Rapids are right now we're sitting at nine point seven eight\nAnd uh that's the lowest we've been in the better part of the week week and a half and that will be rising back to eleven point eight is the latest forecast sometime later Thursday in early friday the cautionary note I Will tell you\nIs that all the high to grass trail off at the end of this\nMember only forty eight hours of rainfall is taken into the models and because we've got a nine day that's packed with rain\nYou're gonna see these numbers fluctuates and if you live along a river or if you have an interest along the river I really highly recommend you at least check this daily\nIf not two times a day or just to see what these numbers are going to do because we're in an extreme pattern it's very abnormal\nUm we're going to get as close as we can possibly get 'em but there will be some air at times and so that's the thing we need to watch for when you have an extreme pattern like this\nYou know they're going to do the best they can to get as close as they can but there's some time some things could surprise us a little bit when it comes to the water so we'll see what happens with all these rivers as move our way forward because it looks like this pattern is going to go through mid month yeah so this is just within the next forty eight which today's rain is not really measurable\nTonight clearly measurable and that's the only taking into account tomorrow's thunderstorms and nothing from Thursday onward so it just enough why I\nI just got a call from WAMC morning shoulders and said M coke at a river of like Dell high uh that's another one that she said there's boat slips submerged uh if you think you're going up there to to get on the river low yeah please don't yet [laughter] don't do it\nWhen these rivers are high life is you know just that there's no reason to do it or when these rivers are as high as they are think about all the debris that's in their thinking about the stream flow that's in there\nAnd think about the way that that water and the combination of those three thoughts should keep you away from the swatter exactly you've got to let it get down this is not an any time to do anything recreational round this stuff\nIf you want to you know help out with with flood efforts and and there's an bags and things fine but don't go recreationally out on this watery just it's it's

M. T. Hey Rachel thanks for joining us here on the WFSU morning show how has your Tuesday starting off so far so good how about you are doing well I had in this place yesterday I did a little monologue about how\nThe really the national thread of conversation is really toxic and poisonous at this point and now we really need to be made sure that we're taking care of the closest people around us and in in us ourselves as well\nBecause of how fiery this whole debate around a judge Brett Kavanaugh the influence with that and to me too movement has become\nAnd then into the middle of his obviously is all the politics including um the majority leader Mitch McConnell saying yesterday hey we're going to have a vote on this by the end of the week does that's likely at this point\nMaybe ... into your first point I totally agree that this has been in nationally packing situation not just on the key players you can't even imagine what they've been going through but the rest of America or semi friends that I talked to a night when it down some ideas off of them and they'll literally telling me I'm\nCabinet out I Can't deal with as many more are you and I have to keep working on 'em and\nSo now stands at Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that yes they wanted to be able to start voting on Kavanaugh's confirmation this week and that would be probably before the FBI wrapped up its investigation there's they have until friday\nBut what McConnell may do is in debate as soon as tomorrow that's called invoking cloture he may do that that that set up a vote on friday potentially and it really comes down to the head count but all the noise surrounding all of this\nIt comes down to who's going to say gay or nay and there's four senators to really keep an eye on through the public and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake and also Democrat\nJoe Manchin who is a Democrat of course up for reelection very now red state of West Virginia it's Trump country that had a lot to be thinking that a lot to weigh as he decides and so Republicans is says they haven't had the one majority\nIt aired at least at least one they could always get the vice president step in and cast a tie breaking vote they lose to donate a Democrat\nAnd then it goes in there\nAnd I don't think that the leader McConnell is going to bring this to the full Senate floor to have a belly flop\nExactly well that's part of the reason that he has the procedural votes in order to go ahead of this you know in order to produce preceded so we can get a feel for things in addition Jeff Flake senator from Arizona is one of those\nWho originally thought he was going to be a likely yes but then he was the one who said I'll do this if you get the investigation we also now there are number of other GOP senators that are watching this as well\nOthers and they just want to keep this whole thing wide open for as long as possible\nA cause for them I think the concern is that you have the allegations but allegations are different than evidence and that's what the Republicans are concerned about the Democrats at this point would just wished piled things until one on top of another\n... and it's so difficult is seen throughout this experience to be able to prove or disprove allegations they're thirty plus years old now than Democrats are saying that\nA cabin I wasn't truthful as drinking habits at the latest hearing well how are you going to print that because someone else said he was a real lash ain't ... you know this is all Thirty years ago\nYeah there's so much this in in your right getting back to what I said at the beginning and and what you can firms that you said\nThis is a very toxic environment so [noise] do yourself Brett Favre ritual make sure you take care of yourself mental hygiene is fabulously I Do what you can we'll talk again soon All right All right take care of a ritual Sutherland Fox News radio here on WMD morning show\nUp we will talk with senator Joni Ernst tomorrow morning at six fifty to we will find out from her uh never won this new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and we might slip in question too about other stuff\n[noise] these these news radio six hundred W.
