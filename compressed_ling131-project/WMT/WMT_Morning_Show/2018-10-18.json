morning though it is\nA clear income conditions all night long and that's what allowed forests to get the coldest we've been all week in most locations in fact all the way down to twenty six degrees out at ... high school so that's the cold is low I saw there could be a few spots an extreme northeast Iowa that could maybe a been a little bit colder maybe down to twenty five but\nUm otherwise a cool crispy night around here and that's exactly what's typical of this time of year as lookout towards the west this morning western I Will completely void of any cloud coverage we do have some scattered clouds out in central sections of Nebraska nothing coming from those and a line of scattered sprinkles over south western Kansas\nThat's what may occur in our area about this time tomorrow and that would be about it over the next week in fact to high temperature today going back into the lower sixties\nWe should be able to turn around pretty quickly for today the air is very very dry from top to bottom in the atmosphere and just really not expecting a whole lot of moisture up here breezy and milder for today tonight increasing clowns back down to the mid forties even some upper forties and spot\nTomorrow and isolated morning sprinkle cannot be entirely discount that\nBiggest take home message for tomorrow is more clouds the not in the wind will be around that at the southwest it Fifteen to thirty miles an hour some higher Gus upwards of thirty five miles an hour may occur but on the flip side it's out of the southwest which is usually warmer this time of year\nAnd so you're talking about another day tomorrow still on track for lower sixties partly cloudy for tomorrow night as temperatures fallback primarily in the low to mid forties and Saturday is going to be an interesting day from a temperature standpoint where it looks like we'll probably get our highest about eleven o'clock maybe noon\nAnd then fall after that as a strong cold front blows across the Midwest the biggest thing about Saturday is gonna be the strong gusty when I'm no matter what model we look at it depends if if they're calculating the wind gusts correctly um but when you look at the pressure difference from northwest Iowa to southeast Iowa you do the math on that\nWins may cost over forty miles an hour at times and that'd be right during the homecoming game so just be ready for that to kicking game might be impacted the passing game impacted so we'll see what happens but just prepare for that northwest when a for everybody going to the game and if you're playing

although next week a slight chance of rain by the end of it but that'll be about it that much needed dry weather conditions continuing in these two points are absolutely in the tank this morning was

Anthony Fox News help stopping what do you\nCall the Democratic party led a salt in our country referencing that caravan of Central American migrants enter the border Fox's Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nWill be windy and you know we'll see just how much the the passes or actually impacted if if they can keep the ball closer to the ground\nUm you'll probably see a little bit less impact um but even when ... down right near the field yeah could be rather substantial but some of those real high hang time ... good wind up\nYou know and the upper oh what the kind of guess we're going to be dealing with here in Iowa City on Saturday\nToday is wonderful and in fact looking at some of the latest model data that just came in no changes the plan I think the low sixties or a slam dunk their total lock today looks really great breezy and milder I Will tell you that I just got done looking at the national weather service weather balloon data as well in all models\nNot surprisingly have come into moist with everything and so that's why I tomorrow is probably not much more than a sprinkler too and that's going to be about edits enough moisture generate some clouds in the mid levels of the atmosphere late tonight and tomorrow\nBut man if we get much measurable rain I'd be\nHard pressed to really think it's going to change anybody's plan about the day a bigger thing about tomorrow is going to be mostly cloudy and windy weather building in with a high right around sixty it does a great uh for the homecoming ... there's been obviously some real warm and real cool homecoming prayed for the hawk\nI'm but tomorrow evening looks fine five forty five stark downtown Iowa City I'd say at least up or fifties a little bit breezy out of the west but otherwise pretty good whether they're mostly cloudy conditions turning partly cloudy by late afternoon tomorrow\nTomorrow night partly cloudy and same story goes on Saturday it'll be very windy on Saturday and the thing about cloud coverage is typically don't think about cloud coverage is having a big role to play in the wind gusts\nActually the more breaks you get in the clouds the more some of those upper level winds can get down closer to the ground and I would call that a mix out and so there's pretty strong wind about Mm three thousand feet off the ground\nAnd so some of those wind gusts may top forty miles an hour here on Saturday sustained probably twenty five thirty five especially during the lunch hour\nAnd the high temperature will probably happen eleven o'clock noon or so and then following towards the afternoon right about forty nine looks like a pretty good average it might get the fifty will see 'em but for all practical purposes you're going to want the jacket all day long especially due to that gusty northwest when Sunday we're mostly sunny low fifties on track\nEarly next week a spike to around fifty nine possibly in the low sixties Monday if we can get enough of south west wind again and then most of them next week it's dry and quiet big rich of high pressure blocks us and yet again\nSo I think we're going to be an okay shape overall has it gone to next week or next best rain chance that might actually be measurable comes up towards the end of next week and into next weekend again tomorrow if anything happens may just be a sprinkler to just to trace amount\nUm but that's not going to have any impact on farm fields or anything I Would not have anticipate and we should see a pretty good week of drying overall as we go into next week to the pattern then would suggest\nA risk of just normal precipitation after that point it looks like a lot of the above north precipitation is going to be down towards Texas\nAnd a strong indication of wet weather in the southeast again has to go into next week I'm just beyond that it's it's pretty seasonal if not slightly below yet on on precipitation so\nUh we'll take that each and every time our temperatures generally average around normal as well for next week so we're pretty good position all in all and this morning was a hard freeze for the vast majority of our area\nEspecially some bar valleys getting all the way down to twenty five twenty six degrees this morning with that clear in Qom Erin place outside right now and nothing but sunshine airports are still behind a little bit um but I tell you what this layer it's very shallow layer of Qusair\nYou're going to be shocked at how fast things warm up today worth thirty one still at the airport thirty to Iowa City still thirty one yet towards Waterloo\nOther than the Nebraska Kansas and Oklahoma the rain down there the nearest precipitation to us was between ... gambling in Canada [laughter] so\n[laughter] that to have fun and yeah I did as a mattress
