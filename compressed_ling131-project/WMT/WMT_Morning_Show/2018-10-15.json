to much aside from the farther northern communities did wind up with a little bit on the grassy area and that's been about the extent of it it was a cold front the largely split around Cedar Rapids Iowa City and towards the Dubuque area Waterloo northwest had a little something but\nOtherwise it didn't really do a whole lot here from ... standpoint we're mostly sunny breezy and chili for today and this is really going to be the rule for quite some time in fact it's a dry weather pattern for us do points are tanking right now so that means any scattered clouds that are currently being found\nThose are going away very quickly as well there is a bank of scatter clouds over central sections of the state rapidly scattering and drying up as they move their way to the south literally high pressure is overhead\nPushing down in those clouds and scattering I'm so not expecting much today forty six the high North West winds attend to twenty mostly clear tonight down to thirty one tomorrow sunshine milder breezy at times again southwest when tomorrow at ten to twenty so that's the difference\nIn a slightly warmer air masses well in fact fifty six are high for tomorrow closer to seasonal average is\nThat on Wednesday we're kinda in between here with sunny sky not as windy looking for a high on Wednesday around fifty then it becomes breezy again on Thursday that at the southwest with ties back into the upper fifties could see some sixties by the time we get to our friday\nAnd realistically there can be a sixty around your on Thursday as well that when can come up a little bit sooner but it does look like towards the end of this week and into the first part of the weekend there is a cold front situated out there\nRight now it seems to moisture starved to worry about at this point so we're not going to worry about inserting any precipitation chance at this time\nBut it does look like the clouds will be fairly thick as we move our way forward towards the late in the week probably right around friday or so and then getting into friday night by the time we get to next weekend temperatures do fall back into the lower fifties on Saturday partly cloudy breezy at times\nEarly indications would suggest a chili homecoming game for the hawks but it should be pretty dry there ah this next weekend and looking at a temperature rebound then right behind that again Sunday and Monday to some mid to upper fifties which is right at October averages at that point so overall looks pretty decent\nUm if you're curious why are the national weather service offices are calling for frost just about every night where it seems obvious\nUm they're waiting for that first official freeze and frost situation to occur across the entire area and then they'll start admitting

I was data Marco Island last week and\nThe hurricane I was it was one of those things where I started thinking back man this was an absolute blessing that didn't turn eastern just come at us unfortunately it did go up through the panhandle and Evan there are entire communities that have just been scoured off the map\nWell they they really have it it it's a it's really quite frightening and a reminder how powerful these storms can be you know it calls are made to evacuate and it's really a good idea to listen there's a couple of hundred\nPeople who decided to stay behind in Mexico each there on the panhandle and it's been what now we can and they have yet to be accounted for uh and that's pretty scary to think\nIt is I Know that uh I have a couple of friends one in Jacksonville but one in Tallahassee a I work with years ago a house for three or four trees in the house and now the building where his office was and it\nIs just rubble and his wife jewelry store the only thing that I understand is left of it was the safe that they put everything in before they closed up before the hurricane so the safe worked out fine\nEverything else routed just down to the ground and we're hearing that is having a hard time just getting in there or is it the communication what's going on with it as\nWell here's the thing FEMA itself is not the agency that does that we've got we've got military we've got first responders\nOr they are the ones that are having some difficulty reaching some areas because it's so ... so a\nA blocked that's what I can put it you know it's hard to uh\nUh to go ahead and do that to ... if you you know certain roads are impassable and you don't have the right way of getting around\nA free uh and if the roadways themselves are destroyed a and and they're not safe for vehicles how do you then proceed so it it takes a while to reach some of these areas this is not necessarily out of the norm for this type of situation similar problem\nA with a with the uh the Mississippi Gulf Coast after Katrina\nI'm so to share this is not really that much of a surprise it's unfortunate ... scary yeah uh but uh it is a reality and of course for people who are reachable areas it must be absolutely frightened because\nWe live in a very connected world ah and when all of a sudden you really are cut off and you don't have access for transportation\nAnd
