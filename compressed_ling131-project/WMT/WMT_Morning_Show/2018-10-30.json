and for the governor rentals to help them\nAnd say in regard to those political advanced one would be a about not having a ... a takeover speaker of the houses and cars that basically put an end to

looks like Chinese anxious adored because\nUh the terrorists are hurting them more than are hurting hurting us and uh then I'm also hearing about criminal justice reform which is something that's come out of my committee that I Hope to get through before Christmas\nUm let's see uh\nThat is one of the things that people on both sides of the aisle you're getting praise from the other side of the aisle for your willingness to go in and criminal justice reform Durban the Democrat from Illinois next door\nYeah mhm and I are the main sponsors a K A couple of quick questions for you um number one I'm the president United States a lot of people they they they liked the way that he governs they don't like the way that he talks or tweets and stuff like that would you consider yourself in that camp if you\nCould shut off his Twitter feed if you just have the ability to just go repressed the off but I don't want to shut it off I just want him to show it to his wife for his his was sent by [laughter]\nThat makes makes complete sense looking back to the Brett Kavanaugh hearings is there anything that you would have done differently\nWell if I knew about this letter that Senator Feinstein kept from the rest of his for six weeks and involve Dr Ford and\nAnd her accusations against Kavanaugh\nAnd if I knew about it I'd say a ... if you want to protect Dr Ford's anonymity or we can do this ah I don't know whether they didn't want to or where they got caught up in something that they couldn't control but we could have had this done quietly and had the issue of solved\nAnd uh and nobody you know who Dr Ford was\nAll in all I think that uh now that all the hubbub is over I think that people are just like okay it's another\nJust another thing people are moving on and the next thing is going to be picking up because the twenty twenty presidential election stretch properly on November seventh well look the Democrats coming to Iowa for the health of those are all the\n... presidential candidate exactly a Senator Charles Grassley thanks so much for joining zero the WAMC morning show in Studio we certainly appreciate the outer\nAnd this is a very friendly way to be here where the ... over the phone definitely definitely I Do like that safe travels to you you\n[noise] these these news radio six hundred thousand you empty Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\n\nBeing born in the usa could be on American I'm Dave Anthony Fox News President Trump wants to undo a policy that critics have said attract what's called birth tourism Fox's John decker lab at the White House\nPresident Trump speaking to Axios on HBO and confirming that he will sign an executive order ending so called birthright citizenship for babies have non citizens born on us soil\nIn our area but again not till then I'm between now and then things are still OK temperatures that's come up nicely and overall is pretty good mid fifties as our average high for this time of year so we'll be above that today around sixty in Cedar Rapids sixty one Iowa City that chance for a few rain showers in the area this afternoon we could not discount\nEven isolated thunderstorm because we're watching the dew points right now coming up around here and if these do points go well up into the forties like is possible\nOr we may have a handful rumbles the thunder to go along with this too but it's a cold front it's got some moisture to play with this is what you'd expect for this time of year early evening showers around tonight down to low around forty one then we turn mostly cloudy and then eventually\nMostly clear especially over northern sections of the state later tonight tomorrow in excellent Halloween and we've been talking about this for a while it's not as warm as two years ago\nUm but it's still pretty nice in fact to hire around fifty seven degrees we're well been at the sixties two years ago and we had trick or treat weather last year by the way in the thirties so it's much better than last year's weather\nUm it's been dry last couple of years and it should be dry again this year high around fifty seven trick or treat time probably low fifties looking pretty reasonable tomorrow night are actual low falls to around thirty four but of course that's well after trick or treat time Thursday partly cloudy with fifty six daddy's November first\nNovember is historically a cloudy month in eastern Iowa and it is one that does feature\nChances for rain as well on average over two inches of rain for the month of November\nAnd when we wind up with is a chance of rain is going to friday looks pretty isolated in a better chance later on Saturday and into early on Sunday that his system number one sister number two comes in right behind that\nEverything that we're looking at right now suggest that all the colder here that would be cold enough for snow would be up to our North West and not so much here in our local area but Minnesota South Dakota easily can pick up some snow or miss work our way forward towards the end of this week but that also becomes much more common and that part of the country\nAs they move into November and ourselves in eastern Iowa we average accumulating snow\nIn November to so we'll keep an eye on things but right now\nJust like a chili rain for the upcoming weekend a chili rain to start next week and then a lot of clouds right behind that and I've been on the receiving end of uh some forecast that have definitely been questionable over the years in November and I've learned from a lot of those and basically the bottom line is is if you ever think clouds are going to clear\nJust go ahead and go against the opposite got and I'm just call for the clouds and you're probably going to win and so that's kind of the way I'm looking right now is a lot of clouds around for almost all next week I'm certain there will be some breaks here and there we might be able to sort out a little better day of but the big picture is cool and cloudy weather\nContinuing right into next week so oh no reason to enjoy today tomorrow on Thursdays temperatures I mean that's about as nice as it gets not much wind on any of these days so I'm ... from a couple of hours rain this afternoon Doug we're in a really good spot here\nIn eastern Iowa outside right now temperatures generally in the forties to lower fifties were forty six right now what Lucy to fall fifty one of these and I we airport forty nine in Iowa City\nCannot complain about this weather because I mean I've got all my outsource outside stuff done good\nHave almost all the ... and leaves yet but I also had to wait until this past weekend I've got still a third of the trees worth leaves and there were some really are you ready for this you know there are some really neat science that happened in my own\nSo all over saying I didn't know what was going to have to be ready [laughter] ... science\n[noise] that you just\nWhat I noticed this I was a I was out playing my girls on Sunday and our tree in the back yard the northwest when as soon as it was hitting the north west side of that tree the leaves didn't stand a chance yeah ... where\nThe wind would have had a localized break was on the other side of the tree really\nSo I've got about a third of a tree exactly the opposite of where the wind was blowing up front it still has leaves exactly it was awesome would if it could just change direction real quick and knock 'em all down that we can get the rake out and get it done um but at the same time I caught that this weekend I went oh that's pretty cool\nYou're not the only one there's a ... it was not her head we actually the maple in our backyards completely scoured now yeah completely go on the front or it's the top half that's gone on the bottom half still have all the little protection\nWell and it was just comical driving around because they're just ... just just\nWaves of leaves going across roads it was it was almost funny just watching the leaves blow around and I'm I'm certain we're going to have another windy one at some point it's tough to tell when maybe this weekend along with some rain um that's probably going to take care of the rest of them here I Would think pretty soon probably in the next seven to ten days so\nThat is something to keep in mind as well um one thing we had our master gardener in\nI'm Talking about leaves on top of your grass and trying to kind of get those things right dot org yeah especially if at all possible for rain has so you might consider that before the weekend today's rains overall pretty light and all of a couple of days dry out but made them before the weekend rained maybe think about getting things cleaned up\nA little bit when they get mad at down they do that and that's the gold and right exactly and they'll do that stuff so that was that just re thanks for the\nDay of asked Serino I've always got some of that exactly\nCertainly do appreciated the story that you should follow out of this is the story out of it looks like a Australia it will not really how can not be Australia\nTo row of police officers

rehabbing though doesn't it I'm sure it does ... it's just in need of relaxation before I go back out there no they'll kick boxing\nExactly it probably will talk to borrow All right you got to be good

Saturday\nAnd it looks like they're Republican strategy here is hold on to the Senate and the fire wall there maybe some of these congressional seats like in Iowa I Believe all four of us are pretty competitive there that could flip a\nBut Republicans are focusing on the Senate in particular and Florida democratic Senator Bill Nelson has been around for ever if being challenged by Republican governor Rick Scott\nHe I think the latest CBS poll shows than tied forty six percent\nThe president will also be heading out to Indiana twice to campaign for Republican Mike Braun is trying to take

I don't have to worry if my health fails in who my successor is going to be\nOh that's interesting I thought it was interesting as well yeah I mean it really it\nIt appears yeah that that I guess at
