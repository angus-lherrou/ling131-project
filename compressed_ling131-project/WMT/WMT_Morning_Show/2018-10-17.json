child to choose that they want to be a vegetarian or you just make them ... kind of like when you're growing up you go to the same church is your parents\nOr do you know I guess I was kind of curious about that um there's Harris Poll back in twenty sixteen it was commissioned by the vegetarian resource group\nAbout eight million us adults who are vegetarian or vegan\nUm they say that people choose to adopt plant based diets for various reasons some ethical some health related but finding meatless options at restaurants\nHave supermarkets can be a challenge depending on where you find yourself hungry in America and there was some experts contend that for going animal products\nCould save the average person about seven hundred and fifty dollars a year\nCertain specialty foods can be expensive and here's the thing I have yet to find a vegetable vegan vegetarian replacement for something that eight tastes as good be is is is less expensive to me\nThey're always it seems more expensive and the other thing is if you want the good stuff is really going to be more expensive\nIn Iowa it maybe a little bit different because we are the heart of the pork industry right okay there are lots of other US cities that offer purely plenty and\nUh inexpensive options for budget conscious herbivores\nSo wallet hub compared to the largest one hundred cities across sixteen key indicators of the vegetarian friendliness and they examined each city based on metrics like the cost of groceries fridge vegetarians the share of restaurants serving these meatless options and salad shops per capita\nDrapes died or downtown Cedar Rapids they used to have a salad shop down the that was the best seller joined I've ever been at\nI'm now ... if you want a really good home make your own salad that's where you go and then that's fine so the main findings or is this the number one most vegetarian or vegan friendly city in the United states is\nNew York city\nMakes it All right you got a lot of people looked at Portland, Oregon is second that makes sense too because they are a bunch of bicycle riding granola crunching fools out their Orlando, Florida I was surprised was number

friendly city and the country's Austin, Texas number eight is Scottsdale, Arizona number nine in San Diego which doesn't make sense to me either\nBecause taco culture and beach food cultures out their Las Vegas Nevada seriously\nVegetarian or vegan friendly you know I guess\nYeah you're right it was easier to get fresh not as far to ship in the east and west coast so there's not a whole lot of yeah you're right about that Chicago Illinois you got to go down to Thirteen to find the top Midwest City that's big and are vegetarian friendly\nAfter that Madison, Wisconsin number twenty Milwaukee,
