going to be a pretty good game to ah they for those wondering about Iowa State there could be some weather delays down there so um yeah another big line of storms coming across Oklahoma for tomorrow\nWhy to weather delays in one season would just be a bummer but we'll see what happens down there um with Iowa State in Oklahoma State this weekend um our local weather is going to get extreme um in fact later on this afternoon into tonight\nOr some of the latest data continues to suggest just getting dumped on by rainfall here ah we're already starting to see the beginning of our event this morning it's out in the eastern sections of Nebraska and northeastern sections of north central sections excuse me of Kansas lifting its way straight to the east north east this is a problem it really is a problem\nAnd when we look at the data this morning when you have a record amount of moisture\nGetting pulled up into an otherwise fall ... a lot of times people say well doesn't need to be warm to rain heavily well if the atmosphere is forcing\nReally moist air into a cooler environment\nIt's going to condense like crazy and get you some really really heavy rain and so that's the big concern for this afternoon late in the afternoon a we're probably dry aside from a few patches of drizzle between now and four so I mean we can salvage most of the day\nSixty three the high watch some heavy rainfall after four or five o'clock this will be impacting some friday night lights football games already got off the phone with one athletic director or in between our last cuts and help them with some decision support today\nAs to what's going to be going on and so the biggest thing is timing out these things because you know\nThe guys can play and rain it's just you can't do it when it's lightning I mean that's a big problem so we will have some some fairly robust thunderstorms in the area here as a move our way into the evening and overnight still an early indication right now of a one to three inch rain this is kind of been the indication census past Wednesday\nAnd I will tell you this and it I I Can't tell you exactly where this will happen but somebody is probably going to exceed that\nAnd if that happens then flash flooding would be likely and so the flash flood watches out for a reason for tonight Cedar Rapids right in the heart of it um\nThe story through Waterloo independence Iowa city is in it and so we're going to get some good rainfall in the area tonight into tomorrow then it's a totally separate system tomorrow night into Sunday\nTotally separate one Sunday night in the mundane and when you look at the data the way it is in its screams that you five hundred percent of normal precipitation that literally the chart doesn't go any higher than that\nBecause that usually only happens and you know hurricanes and things and so you look at something like that and you go well this is a different\nNot just for Iowa but for eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and much of Kansas is just the biggest swath of moisture and for this time of year I've I've seen so it's going to be interesting role in this together going into next week a daily rain chances will be with us or by the time we get a Thursday if next week\nMaybe that can be a drier day ah we still have isolated showers in there I I updated that to drop the rain chance down a little bit but we're still six days out and there are so many moving parts that that something could either delay or coming a little sooner\nAnd so uh we're going to hang on to the overall wet look and feel that this pattern next weekend I Know we're going to have plenty to talk about locally with all the different rain chances happening\nUp next weekend um there there is something else that's going on here um hurricane I Need to get the pronunciation ... surgery Sergio Sergio [noise]\nSo that's a problem where and that going to be in the Eastern Pacific\nOkay and then coming up Baja and then coming through Arizona and just like this last one dead and so when that happens you tend to enhance the moisture even more and so what that could mean his mid October could still be wet if that thing does get ingested in the jet stream and come to the north\nNot saying it's going to happen it's saying we're kind of have to watch it and see because of that comes up here the next weekend is going to be wet as well and so it's a interesting month that's what that's going to come down to an interesting month or we're gonna see records break somewhere\nUm we're in the ... come up to unfortunately that's just the unfortunate truth about this whole pattern is you just you cannot rain this much in October without having ramifications\nSo we'll see and as for the harvest it's\nI don't know I mean it's going to be a long time unfortunately if you're going to have ... and the ... it's not yeah it's not a not a a a good thing at All right now when you're looking down the barrel of a three to seven inch rainfall total towards next week on top of what we already picked up earlier and on top of what's coming tonight\nThat's a big problem for agriculture so we're need to keep a close eye on everything over the next week or two and that's definitely something I've not seen before by the way a quick update from yesterday um we set that record for the biggest twelve hour temperature drops\nGrand island Nebraska and had a record high on Wednesday at Ninety four and they fell down to forty five\nWow now and the idea [laughter] that's crazy and I should as a side note forty five was there Hi wow yeah that's\nSo this is was that was a heck of a cold front that hit us here are back on Wednesday outside right now we have a few patches of drizzle left temperatures have barely move toward forty seven Waterloo fifty at the airport fifty one now and I say\nFifty one degrees broadcast park cloudy drizzle where I'm going to be for the next week it's going to be close to
