M. T. [noise]\nGood morning on the devil you on the morning show regularly filling in for a while now joined by former Cedar Rapids Baron now with a metro economic alliance Ron ... morning Ron good morning\nRandy how you doing I'm doing very well good good house the city doing you're on the forefront of the economic development for the city now\nWell there's a lot of economic development projects going on in in Cedar Rapids in in the region I mean the Cedar Rapids metro economic alliances a business organization\nThat promotes business development existing businesses and then we also partner with other organizations to recruit businesses to come here and also the entrepreneurial aspect of it and right now we're seeing a lot of healthy grill a lot of projects in the region\nAnd I would imagine a lot of that as especially in the downtown horror area I Would think would be a situation where I'm at this uh now flood project that is funded is really got people excited it's kind of like field of dreams if you build it they will come or they will build it weighs while we are excited\nTo finally get the funding put in place everybody's work really hard to get the three legs of the stores what I've always used to say when I was mayor you had the state stepping up the federal government just announced their support this last summer and the city council\nJust approved the local match so the three legs\nOf the stool from financing the flood construction project or in place now we have to build it and today at the economic alliance and people may not know what the Cedar Rapids metro economic alliance is but we're a business organization maybe they're more familiar with the term chamber of commerce\nBut we're hosting a two events today one from two thirty to four thirty and then again from six to eight thirty where we've invited all the contractors\nSuppliers anybody that would have an interest in this massive infrastructure project this is the largest infrastructure project that Cedar Rapids has done since the construction\nOf interstate a three eighty it's going to be an annual spend\nThirty five fifty five million dollars but we we really need just a flood mitigation system as people know they've been watching the river price last month words you know had a crush three different times\nAnd uh so we know how important it is to build this and we've had a historic flood followed by an historic recovery and we're calling this an historic build\nNow I ... you mentioned that about three eighty the comparison to that ... it's been ten years and you you've been part of the fighter as well with a lot of other people but it's but get the funding get the funding to get the funding now we have the funding the three legged stool and now the massive project to kind of\nHits you like wow we we do have a big project right in front of it\nWell it is a it would be the largest project that our community you know ever undertake and that's why we want to get the construction industry ready and part of the the system will be built by the city and then part of it by the corps of engineers\nAnd at today's presentation and we have a sold out crowd at the two three to four thirty session if there's any contractors out there listening this morning we're suppliers that want to learn about the the timeline this the construction schedule of this flood mitigation system there still time to come to the six thirty session\nBut the corps has a different set of rules a than what the city has we really got to get our local contractors or any contractor really subcontractors they don't have to be general contractors any subcontractors suppliers core certified\nSo the court will be here today and they're going to outline most of the meetings that have been surrounding the flood mitigation up to this point Randy have been the alignment or the aesthetics were uh people were asking where where's it going to be built\nA et cetera this is actually going to get down into the weeds a little bit about the timeline how many beds or they're going to be one of the ... going to be on the street and I think in the next Eighteen months between the corn this city there'll be six beards and what a bit is\nIs a piece of the uh the construction system and that's it we're going to break this piece out in the bed is up for this section and then that the contractors\nOr react to that but it's going to be a a lot of work and we need to contracting community to really lax up because we talked about all this other development going on plus the normal a traditional stuff that cities do with with streets and storm water and stuff\nAnd this is an addition to everything else that's going on you mentioned mistakes\nAnd I'm really the look of what the flood control is going to look like but it does the court allow for much input in that area of the project\nThe core certainly does and the community has given a lot of input to the city and the court over the years as they were going through the design stage of everything but we're really through that design there were a couple a changes that were made earlier\nThis week by the city council to actually extend it north to protect cedar lake and all the\nInvestment that's going to be done in Cedar lake on this connect\nUh see our effort between the the new bridge down by the landfill and ... and a restoration of the cedar lake so that was a one small change that they may but see this is this is more than a wall or Randy now it it it will have a lot of dirt\nThere'll be a lot of concrete but there's a lot of underground utilities or electrical storm water a storm sewer water cables a lot of underground and then there's these pumps stations to seven or eight\nPump stations along the river and people say well why do you need a palm station\nWell the wall constrict the river from leading its banks but it is raining as the rivers rising which often times does\nThat water from that lands in the city a naturally flows through gravity towards the river walk if there's walls there preventing the water to go into the river it starts to have a backup effect where you need palms to pump that over\nVisit trained tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nThat's family care dot com or call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my
