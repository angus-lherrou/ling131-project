nine whether update currently are just not ... degrees sixty seven in ... for this time of mourning and this time of year\nAt a seven eleven and it's time to head over to the TV on whether lab and check in with Peter all just Cairo marrow getting a little rain here in Cedar Rapids and\nYou know what the flash flood watch for pretty much I Would say the entire state of Iowa pressure toy it's just a matter of where's it going to rain how much is going to rain in a you know how is that could affect the river basin\nThat it yep exactly and I tell you what you got a heck of a storm coming into a marine going Williamsburg right now I'm moving out of ... county in western kick it might just clip you to the west but\nTo me on radar looks like it's going to come right up India and uh that's going to be some very heavy rainfall with this too and of course this is the thing that we talk about Randy is when these river equations are done they are not sitting there going okay there's going to be a five by five mile bull's eye of five inches of rain here\nThat's not what happened it's a broad brush that goes into these that's why the river forecasts are usually close but it's tough to get right down to the tenth of a foot and so when you sit in a situation like this um somebody's going to get hammered is just tough to tell exactly where that will be and exactly how much that will be so that's why we're still really encouraging people\nPlease stay tuned please stay plugged in because between now and noon tomorrow there will be periodic bouts of heavy rainfall that come across and where it all gets ingested that's going to be the big driver of how these rivers go but everything is moving its way to the north east this morning\nHuge moisture plume down to our south really impressive and way out a season off of this time of year in fact the storms that I'm watching right now are in southeastern sections of Kansas as well moving just about straight north\nAnd I would anticipate that started taking more of an eastern is the afternoon progress is so much of central northern I we're going to get hammered by some steady rainfall whereas eastern Iowa if you get underneath one of these storm cells you're liable to pick up at least an inch of rain real quick on that's what the runoff issues may be found today too\nHigh is will be very much like late may end of the upper seventies across our area south wins right around ten miles an hour tonight showers and storms are likely locally heavy rain again a concern also concerned for some strong wind during the evening and overnight hours\nAnd one little side note about tonight's wind is because the ground has been so saturated lately\nIt is not hard for trees to come down\nBecause there's so much mud there's so much saturation and when the ground is real dry\nThe trees and the roots can hang on pretty well on but when it's real soft like this some of these bigger trees especially with\nHow many leaves we've still got on the trees right now\nUm that that can create quite a force and so we didn't want you to keep that in mind for tonight tomorrow some storms are likely mainly through the midday hours falling temperatures in the afternoon windy conditions will start the day probably in the mid sixties that's going to be largely be are high and I bet we finish out the day after school and work tomorrow and loaded mid fifties so\nHave some long sleeves with even though it's going to be warm in the morning it will not finish out the day that way and more importantly the rainfall ends by lunchtime tomorrow Thursday mostly sunny windy chili a high a forty nine\nIt'd probably feel more like twenty nine or thirty by Thursday morning and by the time we get to friday there was a risk of a frost maybe a freeze in the area mostly Claudia Hi around forty five and the only adjustment to the extend that here was to take friday's rain chance and basically shifted forward day\nInto Saturday and Sunday because the pattern is showing signs of slowing\nI'm the one good part about hurricane Michael is that it is allowing the pattern to kind of flush itself off to the east but\nHurricane Michael is also slowing the next incoming system that's happening here for the upcoming weekend but uh thirty more hours thirty more hours and we're going to be done over there and we're going to be out of here yeah which is good news the cedar river at Cedar Rapids latest forecast update is still for Eighteen point five\nAs it goes through this weekend towards Sunday and again still could fluctuate a lot of it's going to see you know just Waterloo gets what a Cedar Falls get to and what are these other tributaries are really kind of contribute to this so I'm there still some moving parts very confident it's going to hit at least sixteen\nUm but uh hopefully it stays below twenty there's also high confidence that will stay below twenty as well so uh Eighteen point five his latest forecast and that'll be reissued again later on this morning with any future adjustments here what sixty three degrees in Waterloo Cedar Falls sixty five at least in our airports sixty seven in Iowa City\nWe're just kind of totally out of absorption I mean don't even play on anything going into the ground when if it rains\nYeah well and you could tell that in fact I was out doing live whether the especially if you raise a around new both we had nothing more than drizzle and some light light scattered rain and we still had puddles and pounding on the grassy area is off the sidewalks\nSo I mean there's just no more areas left for the water to go and do all this is going into pure run off and I really think the next twenty four hours to be real critical as to where these heavy rain bands go and ultimately where they train\nBecause it's going to be that training rain where that bull's eye hits as to what basins really going to get hammered on this thing so uh we'll see right now we're forecasting a widespread one to two inches and let's hope they can stay there um but we'll see ultimately Randy by the morning winds up coming through on this\n... I remember back in twenty sixteen adjusted and that was kind of a case where we're in ... you can help me out it was a really strong a rain producer upstream from ... I think they're all ... yeah and that's what caused our flood\nIt rained for about four hours nearly a foot of rain and that one county yeah and that was it didn't actually rain a whole lot that Monday in Cedar Rapids um it's just that that that flood crest came down the base and from there\nAnd ultimately impacted us because of all the heavy rain this is a different flavor this is just widespread saturation so that's why we're seeing so much run off I'm In this particular case\nYeah but there's all sorts of things like you said it all depends geographically where that ... heavy rainfall\nYep and all the models in this particular case are still struggling so ah we're going with a widespread one to two and a there's probably going to be some isolated much higher it's just tough to tell exactly where that may be\nOK well hang in there will depend on your for the weather information aren't sounds like a plan thanks thanks guy we appreciate ... being part of the WMD morning show there's update brought\nBack by the ... of the coffee of course I Do the two so it's\nCoffee is going yeah when I went in and he's not here are our and Doug's not here then we don't have coffee when I got to go get coffee\nYeah you're you're a ...

WMGK morning seven fifty five and this segment of the program joined by ... I was Senator Charles Grassley now on the phone to morning senator how you doing\nI'm Glad to be with you thank you very much for having me once again\nNo problem or just had a couple of questions about it's been a busy a month here\nFor you and your role as a chairman of the Judiciary Committee do how do you assess some of the uh I'm a lingering comments about a possible impeachment down the road a Brent Kavanaugh is this issue resolved or do you think it's all dependent on how\nA who gets voted in in the midterms whether this issue comes up again\nI think if the Democrats take control of the house representatives for sure if they take control of both houses but I don't think they're going to control the house forever but if they did they're promising investigations and if things show up that didn't show up when the Senate and it said by a fan and\nUh that they would in each Cavanaugh I don't think that's realistic for them to do it even if they're in the majority but that's what they're saying they're doing and they said that they might even the president of the United states\nBut a lot of Democrats are fearful that if they start talking that way the twenty eight eight between now and the election\nThat ah that they won't do good in the interim uh I mean in this interim election but it boils down to the fact that we had a fair through confirmation process I don't think anybody can find any fault with that and uh consequently I think\nThey're grabbing at straws\n... civics one on one here or where would the impeachment process start if they wanted to pursue that\nUnder our constitution it starts announced representatives on a majority vote and then if they would get a majority vote for that sort of impeachment then the trial takes place in the house we're in the Senate but the Senate would have to find guilty by two thirds vote\nOkay uh let's talk about President Trump coming to Iowa a tonight for a rally in Council Bluffs a Fifteen is expected to be the big announcement outta that rally or how does this really benefit I won't go through some of the pluses behind that was\nOkay well there's forty three thousand jobs connected with about forty five fifty ethanol and buy all these plants in the state of Iowa\nAnd so uh we've reached a point where with the increase corn production and the price of corn dropping and a a a Fifteen being the next level that cars can use Fifteen Percent ethanol or at least since uh cars manufactures since two thousand one\nActual highest will be up in the mid to upper seventies for tonight showers and storms likely to nights low is also are high and ah that's going to feature falling temperatures by tomorrow afternoon\nLos tonight mid to upper sixties that's our high tomorrow morning and one of the big things about this is it's still going to be raining tomorrow morning now I mean let's not misunderstand it's going to be another wet morning commutes where they're going to school or work\nTomorrow morning we'll be wet yet around here after lunch hour strong Coltrane clears the area\nThat's in the window go from the south straight out of the west northwest and it'll be gusty probably guessing as high as thirty miles an hour tomorrow afternoon and then the temperatures will be falling from the sixties in the morning to around fifty by late afternoon and so a dresser kids accordingly for school tomorrow because\nUh they're going to need a different wardrobe and the way home versus going in tomorrow night partly cloudy cold down to thirty six that northwest went anywhere from Fifteen to twenty five\nIt's gonna make windshield values on Thursday morning down to the twenties most likely Thursday Afternoon ties in the upper forties but at least it's dry and quiet there are plenty of sunshine\nFriday Saturday Sunday and Monday temperatures are back anywhere from forty five to forty nine for daytime highs lows at night I'll be down around thirty two by friday morning probably some mid to upper thirties on Saturday and around forty has to go into Sunday Morning\nAnd the thing about this and I'm not I'm not sure what it's like in your household Randy I'm but I have not turned the furnace on the yet this year I'm past couple of cold snaps we've had we just kind of goes through it you know whatever [noise] um this one is five days of staying below fifty\nSo I think you're probably going to have more households with a with that a furnace coming on this weekend most likely so I advise you if you haven't checked it out I'm maybe I'm consider a first filter replacements um just because we're going to that time of year check the batteries in your carbon monoxide detector\nAnd that sort of stuff because we are getting to that time of year now where I think this is going to be more than just a one day cool snap it's probably gonna be about five days\nOf ... mainly in the forties and so over time the house is going to cool down but at least it's pretty dry during the stretch there is a little bit of rain later Saturday early Sunday but right now no indication that that's going to be overly heavier really impact the river levels much obviously if that changes will let you know\nI'm right now that does not appear to be a a large large threat at this time\nOutside right now we still have some rain showers around an some scattered thunderstorms to some again very heavy rainfall lined up from ... county here this morning and for the most part here not much south of Iowa City at this point sixty three in Waterloo Cedar Falls area sixty six at Cedar Rapids where it's sixty eight now and I said\nOkay I think we did turn our furnace on once and if that was more like just ... it was kind of like an exhibition game doesn't count regular Stanley nice little\nLittle pushy and but I feel good yeah I just wanted to see if everything was All right we're that trial and error type big too but I pushed it odd for because when we really need it and we really need it\nSo that by the time and get to the weekend I mean uh the wind alone on Thursday I mean it'll it'll kind of test things out a little bit higher forty nine\nBut then we get to the weekend he ... around here that a lot of clouds around temperatures in the forties when the house will cool down I mean so just just be ready for some of that I'm I'm sure you've already been thinking that and some of your way ahead of the game and you've already got all this done\nBut for those that have you know been been working constant weather events like this one like I haven't I haven't had a chance to look and I got to sit there and go okay I've got an extra furnished filter in the basement 'cause I bought two last uh last last fall and winter when I was doing it so it's been kind of just sitting there for a while and I'm ready to put it in ...\nWhile I noticed that thirty two on friday for a no right well and I'm thinking all that standing water there's going to be a large amount of skating rinks developed certain\nOf northern Iowa yeah there could be a little bit of that on sidewalks and thing uh I mean you know thirty two is thirty two when I go see anything on the streams or anything but yeah I mean on sidewalks and things that they're definitely appears to be a risk of a freeze here\nUh towards the end of this week a lot is going to depend on cloud coverage though because already by Thursday night it looks like a few more clouds pushing in for friday if the clouds speed up thirty two could be tough to attain\nUm but if the clouds do not speak up a bank thirty two is more than reasonable now which is actually about average about mid October as we average is the first free so I'm of the one lone thing that could possibly\nBe average in this might be just that little thing right there [laughter]\nYeah okay we we knew there was going to be something there was average original meaning of what it was a complete and that may very well be the\nFirst ... will mark that down a as for actual rain falling October were way off why do you uh where a tenth of an inch away at the ... airport from the all time what us fall season on record since eighty Ninety three bedrooms incredible I mean that's that's goes a long way back and I keep in mind it's only October night\nSo they're going to get that record in Waterloo today and I continue to add to it through November ultimately because now everything that falls is just adding to the record and so ultimately by November thirtieth will have a\nFinal record number to to say but for right now I'd say it and if Waterloo doesn't get a tenth of an inch day I'll be absolutely shocked me out that way job to walk and almost if you Steve ...\nOkay thanks guy appreciate all the weather
