say Parkersburg over to Manchester\nNew Manchester man ... era and points to the north to yeah I'm\nSeeing some of that are farther down to the south that's been enough to what the pavement and uh that's been about the extent of it and when we look at things here and just in how much is falling in the rain gauge as has not been much around Linn county at all in fact in our pinpoints drum nets gauges right now there's a couple that have trip to one one hundreds of an inch\nAnd a it's been very very light 'em up towards the Waterloo metro area with a couple of locations get more than that in fact grow up to five hundred seven inch at expo and Waterloo west has five one hundreds as well so I'm not expecting this to necessarily produce much more than a tenth of an inch even that more robust banned\nUm is it lifts more towards the doors now there's a couple of spots that could be a little bit more towards Charles city because that's where it's been a little more active during the night\nBut further down to the south and for the vast majority of us it's going to be easy in an easy out there's not going to be much with this in right behind at the clouds declaring\nThis little system is broken real quick off towards the east it has to be doing at least thirty five or forty so um it's going to be in and out very quickly isolated morning shower activity mostly cloudy and windy if you're just waking up and you're getting ready to do the uh UN homecoming prayed\nDon't worry about these weather conditions this morning this is not an indication of any type of weather for later this afternoon or even into the evening and we're still thinking that we're going to have a great evening here for the homecoming prayed at Iowa City great night for the final week\nOf regular season for friday night football I around sixty two really nice yeah in fact we should be able to take off pretty nice even despite the clouds around today more breaks in the clouds will be likely this afternoon decreasing clouds during the evening and overnight we're down to forty four tomorrow still tricky on the temperatures probably about eleven o'clock or noon high\nEnd of the upper forties and then falling temperatures after lunch hours they sharp cold front\nBlows across the area those winds may cost over forty miles an hour tomorrow\nLooks like that's the case a tailgate time could be incredibly windy be ready\nDang marrow why things down so ah so you're ... at least you know it's coming yeah and at least I Know you're not going to help I mean I'm not I haven't grants even tried to guilt you into it yesterday during the show yeah no not not\nGoing to have a twenty eight tomorrow night northwest wins five to ten and then as we go towards Sunday in through next Thursday looks like things will be dry and quiet once again the attempted roller coaster continues lower fifty Sunday\nLow sixties on Monday and back in the mid fifties on Tuesday all the while we should be pretty clear during that time frame Sunday Monday Tuesday more clouds towards the end of next week\nAs it does look like the pattern will start to change around a little bit more towards the cold side\nAnd perhaps more towards the west side by the end of next weekend into next weekend I'm outside right now the to moderate rain bands that are set up one is up through Charles city and the others ride along highway twenty but again it's moving east northeast fairly quickly this morning\nAnd not expecting it to drop a whole lot of rain fall down in any given location\nCedar Rapids Iowa City so far is basically just been traced to hundreds of an inch and that's been about it that little band east of Des Moines is probably only going to be capable of that as well as that keeps on going to the east so\nI'm the drier definitely not plays a role in how much this is actually able to produce\nAcross our listening area outside right now temperatures are milder though there are a good twenty degrees warmer now than we were yesterday at this time in fact all of our airports are back in the forties upper forties and if not there some low fifties were fifty one right now what ... forty nine at the east and I we airport were fifty now and I will say fifty\nDegrees not broadcast park and the devil you know in the morning show so what you're saying is that tomorrow it'll blows think office

so that's\nExactly where you need to be after the Iowa game and after you go to the Hudson's or stuff on by EPA we over on the north west side\nAre we are expecting that to be a continuation and that should keep on coming our way today mostly cloudy and windy as the general theme or with a handful of ice that morning shower still possible\nThe wind will turn around and the southwest at Fifteen to thirty higher wind gusts are potential but probably not till late afternoon on that\nHighs around sixty two with room to exceed we may see some mid sixties and spots this afternoon so I'm saying that for most areas this afternoon maybe the nicest afternoon or the week so far even though we're not starting off the day looking that way tonight decreasing clouds down to the mid forties tomorrow partly cloudy and very windy tomorrow will not be the most pleasant a base\nAh winds may guest over forty miles an hour times northwest wins anywhere from about twenty five to thirty five\nThat high temperature right around forty seven degrees and uh that's going to be a tough one for football a tough one for tailgating\nBecause of some of the higher winds that we're going to have to deal with in the area for tomorrow I'm timing out the period of strongest wins um if I had to make a call right now between probably nine AM and three PM so firmly within game time and definitely within tailgate time so be ready for that I can see the front on the satellite right now\nAnd that should have some pretty good wind gusts with it as you go into tomorrow Sunday mostly sunny much lighter wind will fry around fifty three mostly sunny beautiful on Monday back to the lower sixties then we're back down mainly to the fifties next week as high pressure takes over we may start to get more of a shower he pattern to get going towards the end of next week and into next weekend we will see at that point\nUm but between now and then aside from about another hour's worth this morning there isn't a lot of moisture in this particular weather pattern and there's a lot of dry air to come over the next few days up tomorrow there is a scenario where extreme northeast sections\nCould pick up a shower right along this cold front but in so many areas that will be partly cloudy windy and dry that's the main take home message for tomorrow and I would not expect any precipitation towards towards Iowa City at all I'm just giving indication some of the raw data that we look at\nHas a wind gusts of around forty knots tomorrow at eleven AM\nSo you know if you do the math I ask you what do you say all of my childhood out there to forty six miles an hour show I think we're going to have plenty of when they go around for tomorrow or by tailgate time even I think we could already I've got thirty five forty so just be ready for it I mean that's that's the only thing we can do the only we can do is be ready for it\nUh the wind's going to back down real nice though is he going to Sunday Morning and that's going to be a cold morning I mean will be will be well down mid to upper twenties there\nOn Sunday Morning as a stays clear and call them pretty much the entire time outside right now as we look at the Doppler radar\nThe extension of the rainfall is not as much as what it was last hour it's moving east very quickly\nThe baggage is getting very close to our area right now in fact they get to west of Benton county west of bell plane\nAnd you're just about out of it I mean you're really close to being out of it at that point so are there is not a whole lot left behind this activity as he keeps on rotating off to the east\nOr the heaviest amounts in this case are generally going to be up towards the Charles city areas and up through about decorum lighter amounts further south than even along with that modern ban that came up around highway twenty and where it looked really impressive on radar\nIt only drop between about three and seven one hundreds and some of the gauges along twenty so\nI'm thankfully as pretty fast moving in park on anybody for real long time um but we did have would have some activity out there um nothing developing behind that he and the sun is out of our western Iowa which is great news and I think over time we're going to wind up getting pretty nice here\nI think once we get past the lunch hour temperatures are really start to rebound pretty nice there around the area right now we've got temperatures that are generally into the fifties and if not there some upper forties word fifty degrees Waterloo Cedar Falls forty eight right now the snowy airport fifty and I was saying\nWe dropped forty nine here in the past couple of seconds be because of the sprinkles yeah probably it has little\nSo ah let's see you and I was state grad were you in
