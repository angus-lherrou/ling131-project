little bit over the past six hours thanks is thickening of the cloud cover around here\nShould be a pretty nice day and just a slight chance of rain by the time we get to tonight in fact looking at

Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station it's forty degrees now at eight am [noise] packages\nNumber eight and nine I'm Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one male the former vice president Biden looking very similar to all the other ones that the Democrats another turned up at five AM New York city\nUh we're probably gonna wind up being very similar in terms of our daytime highest by the time we make it into the afternoon hours a chance for a handful of rain showers in that area tonight let's just say that a few showers can break through on some of this\nIf they happen to I'm really not expecting it to do much temperatures are for tonight should be steady right around forty just them isolated showers in the area Mm tomorrow very isolated showers early\nOtherwise partly to mostly cloudy conditions out there and I think for a playoff football tomorrow night looks like things ought to be just fine on Saturday it's more of the same there's a chance at a handful of isolated showers early otherwise we are partly to mostly cloudy temperatures that they should go back right around fifty four fifty five degrees again\nAnd by the time we get the Sunday that's going to represent our next best rain chance I think ah tonight's rain is real real real flight\nOr by the time we get to Saturday Night late into early on Sunday that represent a pretty good opportunity for at least a quick moving ban of rain showers and it is going to turn windy here on Sunday as well in fact the wind biggest over forty miles an hour at times in looking at some of the current data and\nThe European model really led the way last time when we had all the when that was around in fact it's suggested wins over forty miles an hour for about ten model runs in a row which is really quite something and so that was kind of the first tip off\nThat hey you know last weekend was going to be kind of windy on Sunday does not look like it's going to be as strong as what we dealt with this past Saturday but regardless windy nonetheless so at least be aware of it and I did trend that temperatures back a little into the upper forties\nRealistically addict maybe if the fifties but when the wind is blowing like that it's not going to feel that pleasant on Sunday especially with us and wind driven rain showers in the morning Monday partly cloudy a high right around fifty three degrees were fifty four by the time and get the Tuesday next week early indications right now would still suggest that\nMuch of Halloween is going to probably be All right I'm not too worried about it at this point I'm from a temperature standpoint it's not too cold it's obviously not going to be very warm um but it's not too cold this go round then if anything else Wednesday could really be kind of a pretty good position for us I Would say so let's move on with the hawks on the road\nThere at Penn State state college yes the ... the national ... so what time is this game to thirty pm central three thirty eastern it's gonna rain and cat um National Weather service has a hundred percent chance which\nBased on everything we're looking at I Can't disagree with that call I really can't so it's going to be a chili game low forties most likely some steady rain and occasional drizzle going on and ah thankfully nothing severe so be able to play through it but still be ready for a cold rain that kind of rain can can\nMan it takes a day and a half to warm up after something like that especially with it being a steady as it will be\nUm the wind situation um we'll watch to see if it strengthens but right now it appears like it's going to be ten miles an hour less so wind is probably not going to be concerned there at Penn State but I really do think that the precipitation side of the equation is not going to be pleasant a light steady rain and maybe the athletes like that I don't know her\nThey're expecting about half an inch of rain during the game\nSounds about right that sounds about right I mean just kind of based on how that whole system looks right now I'm just a real cold steady rain real shower e situation there um as a move our way into the upcoming weekend there'll be scattered about to be scattered about but\nRegardless it's like it's scattered drizzly has probably gonna wind up happening is well a lot of drizzle around for the game if nothing else let's just say even if a half or three quarters of the game goes by with no falling precipitation the field will be plenty ... from existing rain that would have fallen that morning so regardless I plan if I were the hawks on some white\nRig bores the shoe guy is going to be on with this world warning seven forty five I'm sure he'll have them ready to go there you go ...
