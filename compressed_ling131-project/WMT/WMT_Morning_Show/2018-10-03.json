I Will farmers and the agribusiness industry we really do care about this trade agreement that has been struck between the United states Canada and Mexico by president Donald Trump and his administration\nDo you think that is a is going to be able to pass Congress has lost her and be make a difference positive difference for the Iowa egg businesses\nI Do I Do Doug I think that this is a good deal for the United states and I am so thankful for the Trump Administration for getting it to the finish line now it's up to us and Congress to make sure we're getting it it has to 'em and then\nMove forward but I Do believe it's a good deal we maintain a presence with agriculture NAFTA was really strong in that area\nI Believe that the u._s. MCA will be strong in this area but there are additions that are very helpful for us we said dairy poultry eggs breaking through that Canadian barrier and\nAnd we'll be able to get our goods into Canada now and of course at that level the field a little bit for our wheat farmers which is good so uh it's great for ...\nAnd I do think it's going to be good for of course are American workers as well so I think it's going to be a great deal I and looking forward to getting it passed through Congress\nOkay was and that's something where do we have the timeline on this is something that's going to happen prior to the midterms there's is going to waste fuel is going to be something between now and the you know you're\nYeah and there is a fabulous time frames on when things will need to be done and and we're still about sixty days out from\nTaking a look at it here in Congress but just having the announcement having that the deal out there is really important because our voters our constituents going say what's in the deal they can see that it is going to benefit\nAmerican farmers American ranchers and workers and it's just another feather and a cat for a President Trump because he didn't make this campaign promise and that's another one that he's followed through on\nA I'm going to read you a portion of the street from the national weather service is they say that between foreign ten inches of rain may fall over portions of Iowa here over the next week\nI'm we're waterlogged we've got issues with crops in the field still uh I was talking with former yesterday ... just the we looked incredibly say just because he's not been able to get out there and do what he gets paid to do by do you mean by his crops\nIs at some point the federal government may have to step in federal crop insurance in in some of the other things\nAre in is what are you looking yet when you take a look at the state of Iowa in total when you take a look at the weather issues that we've had a and really the Trump Administration kind of turning pushing back on us on some of the individual a relief the assistance that we're asking for\nWell and there is a formula that has to be followed for federal assistance so it's not anything that the Trump Administration would decide just randomly on their own whether to support\nA those federal initiative a federal relief or not it does have to follow a certain set standard um however\nThere are certain exceptions that can be looked at and and work through but um again just looking at it overall this is one of the reasons why it is so important that we get a farm bill done\nI'm now of course crop insurance that we're we're okay there\nBut and moving forward we do need to make sure that we're re authorizing the farm bill and making sure that those crop insurance protections\nAre strong with the end the farm bill right now we're just really kind of um a stalled point with the farm bill and\nMay have to face that a little bit of an extension or after that the mid term elections and that's not what I Want to do I think it's our job to get that farm belt down and make sure that our our farmers and ranchers now that they will be

eight degrees or broadcast park it is seven can now the W. empty morning show Wednesday October third in ah\nGot Justice Roberts in Studio with us we're what a headset color all up and said hey I'm curious if you can ask guy about the weather for the uh the walk especially for you things especially when they walk on the other day yeah\nYes I was just sent an email yesterday that a congratulations I'm doing live whether for that event so I had already looked into it okay good it's going to bring 'em it doesn't look like it's going to be severe by any stretch but a rain with probably temperatures in the fifties reasonable reasonable estimate\nRight now I'm especially because it's in the morning I'm even though we have a high on Sunday of sixty one because it's in the morning we have a low or into the lower fifties and so I think it's at least a in okay forecast right now to call for some rainfall and temps in the fifties though I Would definitely have your rain gear with young\nFor doing this kind of stuff but the good part is it appears the lightning risk is pretty low at this point I'm for that particular day [noise]\nUm but I tell you what we're we're just ended a sweat pattern there's a really unique feature on the island environment um as an at this morning um and we can actually generate this shirt on on different sites but uh\nUh the guy out there that runs that his name's Darryl and he's outstanding he's the biggest data nerd there is when it comes to weather and other Waterloo area I'm Talking about how many inch and a half to six inch rains that they've had in a day\nI'm their average for the year is to point seven and they'd had eleven days of heavy rain so far this season that have been over an inch and a half in that twenty four hour span\nSo that's part of the reason why it's been so incredibly wet this year as well forty five point three eight inches in Waterloo this year\nAnd a neat statistic that that just found yesterday\nOr the third wettest fall on record at Waterloo already and it's only October third more to come and more to come yet as well two and a half more inches doors Waterloo Cedar Falls and you wind up with what does fall on record\nBut if somebody asked me about Cedar Rapids and while it's significantly above normal it's not anywhere near the record level in September um or even October October right now the recognition I think somewhere around nine inches for the month\nI'm hopefully they don't get to that point but we'll see what winds up happening here because we are in a position today where it's gonna be warm and windy the window be up a lot more than the past few days high around eighty three some of those higher wind gust of thirty five forty miles an hour probably most likely to occur around the midday to mid afternoon hours\nMorning it is starting to pick up though to a handful of isolated storms going on over north western Iowa north central Iowa currently all lifting their way up towards the east north east could get areas of northern Iowa early today but then the vast majority of us will deal with a cold front later on\nIt's a powerful cold front we're down to forty three tonight Cody three degree dropping some spots in fact could even see some upper thirties north of Waterloo\nOp storms are likely in the early evening than rapidly clearing sky the thing about it is you think about these big temperature contrast it's not an automatic ticket to severe weather\nUh but I Would say that in this particular case I'll be really surprised if we don't get rain out of it will put it that way I'm six o'clock to nine o'clock looks like the window tomorrow partly cloudy high around fifty seven this next systems load up on me a little bit so tomorrow night it appears will be the rainfall opportunity as opposed to tomorrow afternoon\nSo tomorrow is a bright spot here with the fact that high pressures coming in a little bit stronger low pressure arriving a little bit slower\nThe problem is as the low pressure systems slowdown they tend to gather more moisture when that happens and so tomorrow night through friday night showers and thunder storms are likely it'll be a cooler day again on friday with ... back into the mid to upper sixties Saturday Sunday lower sixties on the way a\nTemperature spike early next week only because of the block the pattern back into the seventies for highs and showers and thunderstorms are likely in the area a there is a division of no a known as the weather Prediction Center and they put out a seven

years this this\nChance for heavier thunderstorms here this evening down to forty three tonight fifty seven then for tomorrow the situation with tomorrow is the next system has has slowed down a bit\nIt's not a bad thing it's slowed down enough that uh the daylight hours tomorrow pure like they're going to be okay we may have more clouds building in the afternoon um but it does appear like will be a little bit drier for tomorrow in northeast wins tend to twenty a higher around fifty seven a cooler day um but overall a fairly pleasant one at this point given this latest trend\nHowever when low pressure systems slow down they tend to gather more moisture as a result as early as tomorrow evening we can be back at it with some rain showers and then it becomes flat out likely tomorrow night into friday in fact one model when I was looking at how does that a hundred percent\n... pretty robust when you're looking at a blend of all the data coming together for tomorrow night into friday morning at the very least Fridays I around sixty Seventy degrees and latest trends here going into the extended they remain unchanged uh this is a really really wet pattern here\nAnd ah Waterloo already the third west fall on record\nAnd the fall months are determined as September October November and a two point five inches to go at Waterloo for the all time record wet\nFall season which typically if you're going to be dealing with that you'd be looking at it for the last week of November to just in chapter those final numbers whereas in this particular really weird case um we may have one of the what is falls on record in Waterloo by\nOctober fifth sixth seventh\nUm and then the rest of that just piled on top so it's been a very extreme thirty to thirty five days of weather in the upper Midwest here Hi next week are primarily sixties and seventies we have a likely chance of thunderstorms each day I'm we're generally carrying a sixty to Ninety percent chance of rain next week\nNow there will be times and there are laws in the activity it's impossible right now to tell you when those laws could occur but in between low pressure systems um would be technically the timeframe that you'd probably just to have some clouds some drizzle some missed around\nUm but this pattern looks like it's going to lock in for the better part of the next ten days I did have one person asked me earlier when do you think it might break\nWell you know forecast predictability\nOnce you get beyond ten days unless you're seeing something that's really striking you like a below normal ... are real real above normal one\nTough to tell with precepts sometimes um but for the least the next ten days\nIt looks like things are going to be quite active or we are noticing though this stubborn ridge of high pressure continues on over the southeast United States and uh I I like to talk to the national weather service officers in the in the chat program I'm quite often actually some days it was real quiet or just you know\nBugging about sports or whatever\nWhen it's real active though and all their wealth of knowledge and they they um they we we bounce and stuff off each other's heads every now and again and uh one of the tricks that are looking for here is that big upper level high pressure system is around the Carolinas\nWe tend to get a lot of rainfall\nNow typically we call that the ring of fire pattern and I've always used that trick in June or July when the ridges down south around Arkansas but in the fall I'm One of the tricks is when it's around the Carolinas and uh that hot high pressure ridge down there Doug is over the Carolinas through next Thursday\nSelf or at least the next eight days this is going to go and I would say let's just go another five days beyond that because things have been trending slower as of late [noise]\nUm I mean already in the short term forecast tomorrow's rain falls pushed it tomorrow night they're already seeing the slowing effects happening so um I Would say is is it's incredibly what month incredibly what month and a conservative storm total for rainfall is probably another five to seven inches by the end of next week\nI'm so that's ultimately gonna lead to some river issues um right now the rivers have gone back up again\nAnd some are still above flood stage others have yet to rise um others are currently falling which is good the coconut Manchester is falling right now the ... will be coming up until now looks like a little bit later on here ah today will be continuing to watch it rise\nAnd eventually crest you about twenty five feet at my coke at the YMCA and most of them will come up to around Nineteen feet that's the latest forecast by sometime tomorrow I'm looks like mid day tomorrow\nAnd the cedar up by Waterloo area has that come in about twelve feet um it's about a half foot shorter the initial forecast which is okay but there's still plenty of water in the basin the Cedar Rapids sites as currently Levin point seven forecast to go to twelve point five\nAnd I does take into account forty eight more hours of precipitation which in this case is only tonight's front that is not take anything account for friday or the upcoming weekend of reading next week so I'm just one of those things are gonna keep watching on and that's one of those scenarios where\nIf you have interest in the rivers are we really want you to pay attention to the numbers because when you get this far out a season weird things happen and you can see some fluctuation sometimes a little bit sooner than you want to see them so\nI'm every six hours or forecasts are updated and we did put a link on our app as well so wherever you're going if I Need to check it at three in the afternoon while you're waiting for your kids at school you can do that if you want to do it for supper time you're waiting in line at a restaurant you can do that so uh we put that on her out for for your convenience and I\nI haven't expiring on us or October thirteenth because that's the longest the apple let me leave a headline really\nYes I found that I found the long term limits is a is ten days twenty three hours and forty five years so I think we're we issue with you go all the way through October twenty us a little bit later this week or something bad idea to see what happens outside right now we are partly to mostly cloudy at spots or some nice sunshine in the area and other locations especially south\nTemperatures this morning had been generally in the sixties the low seventies were at Seventy now in Iowa City sixty nine at least in our airports still sixty seven now I'd\nWant to look at sixty nine degrees your broadcast park as well have you ever wondered what exactly they do to get the whitewater course back in shape after a flood on the ... river I've always wondered that helped him back to the city manager for Manchester joins me less than thirty seconds nice\nTight and you can here with us okay awesome alright cool thanks to ... from the TV on whether lab and it looks at sixty degrees NOW News radio six hundred W empty we will go up to Manchester and speak with

morning show Jim thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with this this morning how are things going on your Wednesday\nThey're improving keeps dropping ... yeah\nThat's good unfortunately I don't know if you heard what ... said we're in a swap where the weather Prediction Center is that anywhere between four and ten inches of rain\nCould be hitting Missouri over the next seven to ten days so keep your eyes of the sky keep your ears here and keep your fingers crossed as well I was curious about something um because the whitewater course up in Manchester has been such a big hit\nAnd people not only in the area but from miles around come to visit it what happens to the course when you get floodwaters this is you know rather than president but what happens you get when you get floodwaters are the ... river how to reclaim that whitewater course in how do you get it put back together\nWell so far we've been very fortunate most of the time we don't see much debris or whether it's tree limbs trees themselves\nWhat would you have some dedicated volunteers Roger that will go out there and remove some of those hazards of hung up on the ... will go out there shoveled off and get a model away so they don't go to a stranger or become a hazard and started the course itself so fortunately today we really haven't had to do much to\nDo that is good at this point I Would imagine it's going to be closed until it gets back down you know well below into the normal operating area from the action area where currently sets 'em and you get some debris taken that take it out of there how long does it usually take ah for for to happen\nAnd you know a lot of it for each of it but I Want or fight we'll actually closed the river is open 'cause we don't control that ... that are open or show the river or what we do\nUrges people you're so sense when the water is up as high as it is\nA we discourage people trying to use it um but again it's free will and they're able to use it when they need or want to uh we had a couple of kayakers out there yesterday at a really scared me when they are out there and I understand that they are experienced a kayakers and I've done this for years and\nUm they have a safety for the um and you know what they're doing but\nI I I just heard anybody from going out there with a look at this level or you don't know when those loans are on their um the course does change so much\nOf the water level changes with the wave action does on each drop of water increases um it goes over the wing laws which doesn't which makes it harder for you to find that shoot that everyone goes through for that ah right through the way their actions so does change the course and changes complex\nYeah in Reno in Cedar Rapids specifically after what happened in the Indian creek we lost a somebody here when we had that first the\nFirst ... about with heavy rain about a month ago\nSo yeah if you are somebody who is interested in doing this maybe
