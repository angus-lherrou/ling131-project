east which is good it's still kind of training a little bit and are far this eastern communities where the flash flood warning is still in place\nElse where there's a few returns on radar coming in towards our west but that's just extremely light scattered shower activity and probably just more or less a side effect of\nSome rapid cool air coming in from the north and west and that's also will will be dealing with today to in fact we're starting off in the sixties will not finished that way today will continue to fall it's forty one right now on Spencer\nIt's common now the colder temperatures are coming right now we're still well up into the sixties but again it's going to feel different this afternoon versus a we have right now\nThan I partly cloudy down to around thirty six no false tonight because we will have plenty of wind around frost and wind don't tend to like each other but it's still going to be cold in fact when you do the math on it thirty six degrees in northwest went around twenty\nIt's got to feel more like twenty five twenty six degrees as around going tomorrow when I feel like a taste of late November for tomorrow as they go into tomorrow afternoons high temperature forty six is what we expect turning partly cloudy still windy yet especially in the morning\nTomorrow night looks like that's where the frost risk is going to be temperatures look like there'll be falling back down at that point\nProbably somewhere in to the lower thirties there can be a handful of our river valleys north I wouldn't at all not discount the potential is seeing some twenty seven twenty eight coming out of that\nUm as we go into our northern sections here I'm going to the weekend\nIt's great news here that's all there is to it a forty five on friday fifty three on Saturday now what I Would do is we kind of touched on this yesterday or maybe think about that furnace filter of it because\nI'm the last few times we've had some cooler temperatures it's only been for a day or two and now we're going to be going into a longer stretch of cooler weather infect forty six tomorrow forty five friday fifty three is the warmest we have till next Wednesday\nSo I think it's going to be furnished time off of the vast majority of us [laughter]\nI tell you what I'm ... uh this hurricanes a problem um as it does moving its way off towards the north and east is showing no signs of weakening right now the outer rain bans are getting into the coastal areas of Florida and I it is not we can get 'em in fact the latest hurricane advisory shows a one forty five\nFor wind um that's for a while category for strength and that'll be the first category for to ever impact the\nPanhandle of Florida um another thing about is their news reports that are going around\nAnd some of them are leaving out some crucial details um the news reports that are going around is that this is one of the strongest ... to ever hit Florida and we'll remember Hurricane Andrew okay I was younger than this\nAnd that is on the east coast of Florida near Miami this specifically what some of the reports are leaving out is the panhandle of Florida a cat for in the panhandle of Florida is an unprecedented event\nUm there is no sign of that in the record that go back to Eighteen fifty so or the national Hurricane Center keeps real comprehensive records of all this kind of stuff and the track is actually not out of the ordinary and all that it's very typical track of a a Gulf of Mexico hurricane is just that\nThe rapid strengthening that underwent a winds up being a really big concern and you can kind of think this persistent weather pattern for that because the big rich of high pressure down there\nUm it's been helping to steer it a little bit but also keeping what's called wind shear\nDown and so not only do you have the open water but you don't have a lot of wind shear around the hurricane so it is able to form uniformly like this and continue on strengthening it may very well strengthen through the rest of the morning\nRight before it hits the coastline and places like Panama City look like they're directly in line for it and uh the national weather service down there they're expecting widespread Gus well over one ten and considering that we are at one forty five near the Iowa all um whoever gets hit by that eye wall is\nProbably going to have one forty or better so um that's that's not a good situation now I'm Down in Florida right now that is expected Randy to make landfall this afternoon\nI Would start watching national news wires on that later today as it starts to make landfall there where we are things are quieting down which is good uh temperatures currently are generally into the sixties and again the cedar river at Cedar Rapids forecast to go to sixteen nine\nAs we go into the upcoming weekend sixty four Cedar Rapids sixty five Iowa City sixty four also in Waterloo\nOkay right that that hurricane was an interesting situation 'cause normally they is it did that come off the coast of Africa and they have the entire Atlantic Ocean to build up and really get going and that type of thing but the Gulf of Mexico that's not a lot of real estate so at for it to go from tropical storm\nTo this cat fork at a level just don't have a couple of days just seemed to really really like it was on that hyper drive for intensification hit with us\nYou know this happened last year with Hurricane Harvey is well I'm right before it got up into Texas it went from a tropical storm too about cat for um I don't know Harvey ever made one forty five though um if it goes to one fifty six of the next advisory that's cat five\nSo we're getting really close to five territory yeah um but one forty five\nRegardless you got wind that strong um gusts at the surface will probably be realized well over one ten and especially the ... floor is extremely low so they're going to be susceptible I'm too big time storm surge in a whole bunch of bad things so that's the situation out of Florida big time storm coming in there\nYeah and you know like you say the the lay of the land is low so that means that storm surge they're even more susceptible to that right oh\nOkay well we'll keep an eye on it to the prison thoughts go down to everybody because we know you know ... you know really a dramatic weather situation's really kind of test your spirit a lot of different ...\nAbsolutely in fact one of our stations is down there one of our great stations is in Panama City oh wow you J. H. G. is down there and we were watching some of their coverage this morning\nAnd I mean it's feasible that they're they're building may contain catastrophic damage by the time it's done and especially when as we know during civil emergencies and disasters you know that's where local media and local radio sort at the top now and so if they go down you know we're in the gray family so we'll try and help them out as a way we can\nThat old seems to be nine building back to ... thousand a year to block it through a little bit closer to the minor\nLeague we had we had water in the basement and we had on and bags around the front door right ongoing but we'll see 'em they may be in a a real real tough position down there\nOkay well thanks a lot for the weather details we appreciate it are you at trial um arrows on board from the TV on what the wind up with our first word forecaster the seventeenth\nThis year's not even into sales event it from the motors in Monticello and veteran gives you more ways to save zero percent financing cash back in more on select new Holland tractors have orange products and materials handling equipment these offers in October thirty first don't make the trip to ... motors and visited Monticello today\nYou have more choices more savings when you buy during Diaoyu bonanza\n\nFor the tarp cranberry punch with a smooth and sweet finished but it's a great opportunity for dinner and it can be used as the main point during dinner is also perfect\nFor holiday does make your holiday entertaining special this year\nWith ... cranberry from ... ... very is available apt to winery and beginning October Fifteen to many of our four hundred retail outlets in Iowa if you don't see tests so rich ... cranberry wind in your favorite store asked\nThe manager together for you pass all rich winery is located in like the highway one sixty three between ... and it was open seven days a week\nFrom Monday through friday from nine to six Saturday from ten to six and Sunday afternoon to sing or website it pass all rich dot com ... trend very one from castle rich winery simply extraordinary [noise]\nThey'll go first act of oxygen for the guys to throw the ball last Saturday knocks prove they can beat you what they're passing game\nI'm Casey RG TB nine Scott save all the wide receivers took another big step forward against the golfers especially Brandon Smith but five catches for sixty eight yards including that circus catch\nCoach ferrets says Brandon is learning how to use his body and use the tools that he asked injury news the status of no fan than I re Kelley Martin is up in the air\nFor Saturday's game and on defense socket and even our out\nIowa State news Kyle camped his downfall for West Virginia so it looks like drew freshmen rock Bertie will be the strawberry QB Saturday for Iowa State pretty had four hundred and two yards of total ... and five touchdowns in the forty eight forty to win over Oklahoma State David Montgomery is listed as day to day\nHigh school volleyball last night on nine to lend mar ranked fit than five ales didn't Waller six than foray\nWith the first set tied at twenty three lemar scored two straight points\nSixty five a rapid did they thirty\n[noise]\nNews I'm Gillian blue Michael's on monster with winds of a hundred and forty five miles an hour or taking aim at the Florida Panhandle where it could make landfall this afternoon\nBut fortunately the window to evacuate is coming to a close a fad and already done so for many of the citizens that are in Florida\nThe mid ministry to Brock Long Fox meteorologist Janice Dean warns Michael will cause an incredible amount of damage catastrophic\nFor parts of the band of Florida they had never seen a category four of this magnitude and that's part of Florida and that actually could go down in history as the strongest cat for four October storm so\nPowerful it's expected to stay a hurricane as it moves over central Georgia tomorrow and a new poll finds that a large majority of Americans have worries the nation's voting systems might\nBe vulnerable after this just fine [noise]\n[noise]\nWe squeeze news radio six hundred W.
