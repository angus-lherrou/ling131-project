gentlemen man we love we know we trust our friend in yours meteorologist Kyle Maryland\nYeah I'm going to kick it to to get good well we've got bombshell weather news do we have that phrase because I have a number of breaking whether stories as we take this year this morning [laughter] look here's the thing that I Know I looked up I saw your graphics\nThat said uh parts of the listening here we could have four inches of rain over the next seven days\nYou didn't hear it in my news cast and I said it four times but no you're you're graphic I apparently\nHey that works that that were you know what though this is this is\nOne of the more oddball patterns you're ever going to see for this time of year the amount of moisture coming in here is absolutely nuts and over the next ten days\nAgain again we have the same pattern we end the first part of September except it's happening now in October with a stubborn ridges high pressure in the southeast us multiple rounds of rain moving up and over the area\nA bold production\nWaterloo we'll have another record what month not record all time I hope\nBut record October um I Believe their record for October is under six inches of rain already three quarters at the airport just midnight\nAnd the pinpoint storm that site we have up there ... west has to point three inches of rainfall and the gauge\nSo it's a tremendously tremendously wet pattern there's fog happening to the south to now would you want you to be aware of that there's just a lot of stuff going on this morning I'm forecast models are all over the place as to what to do with this thing well we're going to do is we're going to err on the side of things being cooler and cloudy here\nAnd not so much on the warmer side of things yeah ten fact temperatures today probably not much better than mid to upper sixties or could be the low seventies around I was sitting here listening to us from Waterloo and points north I wouldn't plan on anything greater than about fifty five or fifty six today\nBecause it all depends on where this front stalls out where this friends does outlaw maximize the severe weather risk this afternoon thinking between one o'clock and five o'clock just be on the lookout for that here today\nFor tonight that chance of showers and thunder storms in the early evening we may have periods of fog and also some areas of drizzle later on tonight and tomorrow morning\nOr for the most part this looks like a cooler day coming tomorrow for just about everybody though it it may be slightly warmer for Waterloo and points north\nTemperatures tomorrow held back down to the sixties a chance for some scattered showers and thunderstorms again tomorrow night and then again on Wednesday Wednesday as a day where there's a lot of different potential going on here where if we do wind up getting some sun for three or four hours a week could easily zoom in the eighties\nIf we don't though and we stay cloudy and we stay humid and even some some areas of rainfall may break out in the morning there's a strong warm front lift north\nThen we'll probably stay more mid to upper seventies but regardless that's your warmest day most likely over the next nine coming up here on Wednesday and with warmth come severe there's another severe risk Wednesday night and early Thursday\nAnd then Thursday night all the way through about middle of next

Mexico and an agreement to replace NAFTA which the president has called a job killing disaster Fox is John decker live at the White House\nI can tell you there's a strong probability of a four to six inch rain over the next seven days not all happening at once um but basically in a cumulative sense so I'll be ready for some wet weather that being said it is still raining over our northern counties right now and farther off towards art at south and west\nPretty healthy looking thunderstorms around Omaha this morning on the storm Prediction Center has maintained there's severe weather risk\nFor this afternoon so do you want you to keep that in mind Cedar Rapids Iowa City to view Gulf firmly involved in that and we've got all the hazards on the table strong wind large hail and even a chance at a brief tornado as well so it's something to keep in mind now and October we've had this happen before\nAh with with tornadoes that can occur um but the fact is we've got multiple severe weather risks here not just today but then another risk on Wednesday and then we'll see if we get more risks as we get to even deeper into the month of October but we're going to be looking at a lot of rain fall in this particular cents worth two point four inches of rain Waterloo west high school\nIn the past twenty four hours two point five is the normal for the entire month of October just kind of put it in perspective for you but we do also have some fog in areas where it's not raining this morning\nWe do have some areas of fog in fact they use in our airport is down to three quarter mile visibility fog south of interstate eighty we're down to a tenth or two of a mile and some spots even a little more sucked in than that and what's happening here\nIs that you've got the air that has more moisture in it further down to the south and as that ear runs into this cooler air masks that we have\nIt generates fog that's called infection five which is typical in the cooler season you don't see that a lot in the summertime but you do see a quite often in the cooler season so that's why it's developing where it is in terms of our temperatures today\nAt the great gosh depends on where you're listening to us from fifties north of highway twenty sixties central sections and probably some Seventy south of interstate eighty\nBut the thing about it is as these storms continue to fire up and move our way I plan on a pretty active afternoon with several warnings possible not to be ready for that tonight we're down to fifty too far lower chance of scattered showers and storms at least in the evening and then everything right now is showing the atmosphere being tremendously saturated imagine that\nAnd leading to some areas of drizzling fog again I'm right behind this as a move our way into our Tuesday and I walked forecast models aren't generating much rainfall tomorrow we're at least going to keep the fact that patches of drizzle could occur look for a high and low to mid sixties tomorrow Wednesday [noise]\nInteresting day in terms of temperature now we're going to play the slightly cooler side of all the data here with some upper seventies on the way breezy and milder\nThere is a chance of some scattered thunderstorms developing later Wednesday that too has a severe weather is gone it Waterloo and points towards the north and west as we work our way towards the end of this week it's low pressure system after low pressure systems that comes across the area uh I remember working October of oh nine\nAnd October of oh nine was a tremendously wet month and that's where some of our record wet numbers come from and in that month if I'm remembering correctly and I will probably have to go back and look at the counter to be sure but in that month it was not a situation like this one it was more or less just\nBig low pressure system would come you know once a week and it would give us a lot of rain and then we'd stop for a little while and then it would hit again and then we'd stop for a little while and ultimately the biggest impact from nine or was not a whole lot of a flood potential it was a lot of it on on the delayed harvest\nThat was a big concern of mine is that we're just due to wet to get out there in the fields in October to get anything done\nRight now or even if the rain stopped right on Tuesday of next week which would be nine nights of October and\nThen you have to figure that just beyond that even if you were lucky enough to get a few dry days\nIt's going to take at least five to seven to ... and then after that I mean we're there's already a parade of fresher ... going through mid October so they are not going to get much much field work here unfortunately at the ... and the biggest thing we've got to watch for right now\nIs the risk for severe weather which will deal with those day by day\nAnd the risk of river flooding again and one thing to pass along\nUm in October and in the cooler months I just found this out from the national weather service and typically in the summer months they will take twenty four hours a forecast rain fall and incorporate that into the river forecast\nApparently in the cool season they will utilize forty eight hours are really the reason behind that is what I'm understanding is that you tend to have more of these widespread strata form rains which tend to be a little more predictable [noise]\nI'm not the type that we're having right now so we will see if I'm guessing that policy is going to be an active regardless I'm so we'll be watching the height of grass carefully which of the river flood forecasts and everything because all these basins are really susceptible right now considering we're already flooded twice in the last thirty days\nSo well we'll see what happens here is going to October but this is a\nIs a really wet pattern just ridiculously wet and uh it's really from Iowa all the way back to Missouri Kansas, Oklahoma that whole swath just getting soaked over the next seven to ten days so it's going to be tough to do much fieldwork unfortunately in October um hopefully we can get some kind of a drier pattern towards\nMaybe the second half of the month but you know that's that's Fifteen days down the road so we'll see\nWhat forty nine right now with the heavy rain and Waterloo Cedar Falls fifty two at the airport in Cedar Rapids fifty five now and I said yeah I'm Glad I'm heading to Florida next weekend for a week vacation so yeah well you'll have a good time down there and he ate it all the drier down there to say that usually those ... but\nStep no not a concern and all those don't simply turned severe either so\nAll right we'll talk to you tomorrow morning already sounds like a plan dug up a good what are you do
