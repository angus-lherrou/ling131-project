[noise]\nSure it varies by a white we have an ID or you return a one World War two twenty three Korean Air sixty nine\nI'm a plane or older partially one eighty or one eighty one off the water a staff guardian says well\nExactly now going on this this is really um it's a really emotional time for a lot of people and that's one of the things to folks from sun country that you charter to do this like they're all veterans if this is well they've had they've been on nearly all these lights and the ones that are you still use them and it's still the same flicker\nWell last uh two or three flights I think maybe mostly this year than American Airlines or chicken American Airlines charter today or we may be switching back to the next year they'll we're looking at some times\nBut it's so neat because the flight crew in in in every one of these that I've talked to even from the ones from other parts of the country they are so emotionally involved in it as well\nYeah it means a lot you know I I Know somebody that works at American Airlines your your average ... ... you know what works for American Airlines across it so yeah I've been able to people\nThat you know from your your experience great crowds we have it well very very emotional\nBruce this is something that can be prohibitively expensive for a lot of people but you were making ... if ... for people to do this uh and you do this by working with local businesses highlight some of the businesses who do you work in order to raise funding to do this\nWell quite a bit like sponsor of our last Quaker Oats\nI'm always hungry for bagel area I could be the bagels are one of my favorite things have all the time oh I Know they're delicious especially when you get that national crunch on him and okay enough about let's talk about the weather here because I'm the yeah we've got some decent weather are coming up it's gotta be reasonable especially for Hawkeye gamed it looks like Saturdays still\nYeah I mean dry but it's going to be windy it will be windy so what would you want you to be aware of that ah we're in a situation a we're really in this particular pattern there's so little moisture to worry about with any of these passing areas of\nA low pressure that were really more focused in on timing out the wind for planning purposes and so today it appears August to around twenty five miles an hour the past three days have been able to do that\nWith about twenty miles an hour to twenty five to the past two days being able to do that\nOr this afternoon I think the wind is going to work in our favor to get us to around sixty degrees or when you have a west wind in October and it's dry out here west and the air aloft is warming up\nI'm going to be in a pretty good position to get to sixty today wins out of the west at ten to twenty ... twenty five possible mostly clear for tonight back down to around thirty four as the core of high pressure then\nStarts making some eastward progress late tonight into tomorrow will notice the wind but it won't be as strong as we make our way forward into tomorrow infect sunshine with a high right around fifty degrees\nOverall looks pretty good about ten degrees below average\nBut still looks really nice clear sky tomorrow night that's where the wind becomes light and that's probably gonna be a cold at night of the week\nDown to around thirty degrees for a low temperature as we get up on Thursday morning the same thing happens pretty much as this morning we turn mostly sunny it'll be milder breezy southwest wind will be around so be ready for that with highs and the upper fifties right around sixty degrees again possible\nFriday this is the one a hiccup out there and the extended as to what to do with handling this day\nIt appears at this point there's so much dry air around that we're just not going to see much on friday aside from some scattered clouds like the main plume of moisture is going to hold while down towards our south\nLet's say that it does manage to advance a little less just hypothetically say it does\nMaybe a sprinkle a worst case in the morning and that would be at at that to me is not even worthy of a chance at this point so keep an eye on things but uh our our main stress there is I don't really worry too much about that what I Would start planning for though towards the end of this weekend into the upcoming weekend obviously it's homecoming weak\nIn Iowa City that's a big deal homecoming preys on friday evening I Would plan on some wind around for that mainly out of the west for the parade time Fifteen to twenty five is what I put in the forecast here this morning for the homecoming parade it's five forty five start\nFriday evening at at Iowa City and then for the Hawkeye game itself\nIt's an eleven o'clock kick off and it looks like a pretty strong ridge of high pressure is building in from the north and west\nYou take that cool dense air and you blow it over something like this you're going to get a pretty good amount of wind coming across the area as we move our way into Saturday So do be aware of that temperatures probably around fifty by game time a hive around fifty three\nAnd it is possible especially in northern sections of the state we may lose a few degrees towards the afternoon as a strong cold front pushes across a lot of the raw model data we're looking at Doug suggests sustained winds of twenty to twenty five\nSo gusts over thirty five still look pretty reasonable here obviously going to Saturday Sunday that ridge of high pressure parks on us and we should be looking good right around fifty two there for our daytime high so\nI think all in all we're in pretty good shape your this is classic October are advertisers time years around sixty three we tend to get a few more windy days in the back half of October than we do the front half so\nUh this is pretty classic set up right here with thirty five right now in Waterloo Cedar Falls thirty three at the airport thirty four in Iowa City\nAnd we're at thirty five and broadcast park last yesterday I was outside working guy in the backyard taking care of getting plants out of boxes I unpack entire shed put all the all almost all of the um the summer entertaining year in their\n... and still had room and I did that in shirt sleeves because it was I mean I was not it was nice and warm I was building sweat\nYeah well and I mean the sun the sun makes all the different oh if it is sunny and forty six\nIt feels a lot better than cloudy and forty six yeah and so that's why I think today is going to be pleasantly really nice for everybody\nAnd we'll see if the airport gets to sixty but I bet a lot of locations wind up briefly getting to sixty degrees this afternoon and you get that nice breeze to come through this is about as nice of October day as we've had all month meal far so we'll definitely take it took us halfway through the month to get there but we finally have some pretty pleasant fall weather here\nYesterday we were at fifty last year we were up to sixty nine for mhm so yeah we're still in that area we are going to have some nice weather ... to go ahead\nOh no I'm ...

over the town right now and that's about the extent of it a little bit towards the decor area\nA little more towards gotten bird but we're really in pretty good shape here with sunshine and milder conditions and dissipated for today we're looking at ... to go back to around sixty degrees Cedar Rapids on down to the south ... over northern sections of the state\nOverall should be a very nice day from start to finish your little breezy at times when we make our way into the afternoon especially I'd say late morning early afternoon is probably the window of time\nI'm where things could be the strongest in terms of our wind gusts that we're going to have to deal with\nAs they go into tonight we're down to around thirty four degrees that are mostly clear conditions tomorrow it's more of the same when it comes to the sunshine but it will be about ten degrees cooler tomorrow with a lighter northwest wind as well so I'm going to be in real good shape again tomorrow tomorrow is the high pressure system moves over us we\nAre going to be in a position where the wind should be a lot lighter in fact that's the lightest when we'll have all week coming up here for tomorrow clear and calm for tomorrow night down to a low all the way down to around thirty if we may get some frost around is probably going to be on that night\nThursday we're mostly sunny and milder breezy at times again with highs and to the upper fifties could see a few low sixties already on Thursday depending on when those south west winds kick in and just how cold we do get on that morning otherwise friday of a warmer starts today with low forties so warmer afternoon in this case I guess the southwest wind through most of the day\nIsolated morning sprinkles along a warm front\nReally want to stress isolated and sprinkles because it's not even enough to really warrant to ... percent chance I wouldn't think at this point\nMost of the moisture looks to be down into Missouri in Illinois probably just bypassing our area um but it does get warmer there for a day then we go back down the hill on Saturday and if there's going to be one of the windy or days over the next five\nIt's going to be on Saturday So be ready for that for the hawks that will be windy during the game when ... over thirty five miles an hour at times that will be straight from the north and west\n... on Saturday around fifty three degrees it'll feel cooler obviously in some of the stronger winds but at least the sunshine out then we go into Sunday were mostly sunny fifty two next week it's more the same up and down up and down as more raging of high pressure builds in over the northern plains\nI Would argue that most if not all of next week looks dry as well maybe a little something towards a day eleven or twelve which would be next friday into the following weekend but that is so far out there and distance that it's probably not going to be too much of a concern at this point so\nIt's more drier than not no doubt about that and dryer warms up very quickly and the sun has only been up for about an hour yeah across eastern Iowa and the temperatures haven't done a whole lot yet\nUm but as we get the sun angle to get up there we get a southwest when to crank up I Would expect our temperature is especially ... about ten o'clock to two o'clock\nTo really respond pretty nicely today and so much so we'll probably just only eat sweatshirts this afternoon\nThat'll be about the extent of it or thirty six right now downtown Cedar Rapids at the airports were still in the thirties as of eight o'clock
