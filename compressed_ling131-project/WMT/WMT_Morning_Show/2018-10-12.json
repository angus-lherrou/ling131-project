L. Federal Express and UPS are the three\nCargo carriers out there um\nSo this expansion will really be relocating a phase one I'll relocate UPS or from the immediately adjacent to the terminal down to the west end of the airfield and be located next to Federal Express\nAnd then a phase two and we don't have a timeline for that quite yet ultimately and we'd like to get a ditch all down to that same area and really develop a cargo complex that allows\nCargo to continue to grow into the future and it also gives us the benefit of allowing the passenger terminal\nTo also grow into the future is passenger numbers continue to grow that we separate those two dissimilar kind of\nGround operations so we're we're excited to get that project going on the air cargo site this ah actually this year will be breaking ground we broke ground last week and we'll be moving dirt ah with our contractors yet to get this fall\nI Would imagine this is uh something that you develop relationships with all these different to cargo carriers and um they they seem to be pretty happy with utilizing the eastern Iowa airport to the level that they do\nYeah and I and that's really they're happy we got the right facilities and the community we've got a great diverse business next with throughout the region in eastern Iowa that I not only you know bring cargo in shipping cargo\nOut and then of course a nationally we'd seen e commerce really you know began to take off as well and so that the commerce business has really um\nSignificant in and out of our airport and when you look geographically but we we had a a pretty unique advantage I think often times people\nThink about uh you know the intersection of I. eighty and thirty five is you know the place to be a for cargo and in ground shipping afraid when in fact our geography allows you the opportunity to serve eleven million more people\nThan our location within a one day a drive time then you can get from the thirty five eighty court or and so has the commerce really picks up\nThe next day delivery becomes the model for you know air freight and frightened general uh gr positioned uniquely a bill to meet that increasing demand for for\nThat not just the economy in eastern Iowa but a border regions of Illinois Wisconsin and so uh we're we're delighted that uh uh to have this continued growth\nBed as Barney lens who's director of

hurricane Michael\nNow from the dams doors in more first alert forecasts that are here's a TV nine weather updates [noise]\nGood morning were waking up to temperatures in the middle thirties is is what fall feels like a tunnel Mehra from the TV on whether lab I I think we're on track seasonally you don't you think\nYou got that right Randy I Know what if you could probably going to smell it yesterday yeah [laughter]\nYeah you can go and Raul has a sense of one of the reasons why it's my all time favorite season um I actually believe it or not hate springing the most um because that's typically the time of year when you're looking for the big warm ups and\nAbout half the time the clouds mess you up or rain messes up and it just it winds up being extremely tough to forecast aside from\nUm what are they um the holidays in March I I just don't like that month to begin with so I really like fall quite a bit um because we do get to that time of year where things are cool but not necessarily cold\nUm and sometimes there can be some surprises in our weather to\n'em out towards the Des Moines area and they had some snow this morning that was fun to see 'em where we are [laughter] ah I still think we're going to stay pretty dry today and one of the chief reasons behind that and I'm going to be really really anxious to see\nThe weather balloons sounding from the national weather service quad cities office because then you wake up this morning what you see on the map is blue everywhere and you think to yourself there's something happening here that shouldn't be happening well\nIn reality the radar is doing its job and doing its job very well\nUm the issue is or what we're dealing with here as a layer of dry air down near the surface and so these ice crystals these sprinkles these snowflakes uh depending on the temperature of the atmosphere\nThey're falling down but they're falling into dry air and so if you think about how a radar works that shoots the beam out at a steady angle and as you go farther away from the radar beam is higher up\nAnd so the key thing to look for when you have a situation like this is is there a donut hole around the radar\nThat's a dead giveaway this stuff isn't actually touching the ground and so when you wake up you're going to see blue don't freak out it's a it's actually going to be pretty okay day overall a more clouds not highs around forty seven\nUh wins out of the west at five to Fifteen not really expecting much in terms of ... at all in fact in our Sigourney city can I just posted it out to Facebook and Twitter you can see\nThe precipitation falling out of the cloud based but not making it to the ground it's really really cool it's called ... and we're seeing a lot of that around eastern Iowa here this morning for tonight partly cloudy we're down to thirty for tomorrow partly cloudy breezy at times back up to a higher around fifty three and the work our way into Sunday cloudy and Chile breezy at times\nWith that strong of a cold front we cannot rule out a few scattered sprinkles maybe later on Sunday\nI'm banking on a mostly dry day there on Sunday so I really wouldn't worry too much about that it's non measurable regardless\nSunday sigh right around forty three and then this still remains pretty dry pretty quiet a couple of breezy days there this weekend and then otherwise next week we'll start off mid forties on Monday low fifties on Tuesday that's with another warm front that passes by that should also passed by dry but nothing more than scattered cloud and then after that towards the end of next week\nWe're back up primarily into the sixties fries so overall it's pretty good looking extended forecast still looks basically as dry as it did yesterday so up looking pretty good overall all across the area if I had somebody stopped me the story yesterday they are headed out the Indiana\nTo watch the hawks take on the news or is this weekend looks like probably some loaded mid forties to start the game\nIt's a an eleven o'clock game and by the time we get get into the fourth quarter here\nMaybe fifty um so it's it's going to be kind of a chili one

Monday October Fifteen twenty Eighteen over the past few months we've been diligently working on a plan\nThat would allow go see ought to continue as a full functioning convention and visitors bureau and pay its obligations related to the new ball ball festival over that time many ideas were explored and research meetings were held in a frequent basis with stakeholders\nWe appreciate everyone's efforts and openness these discussions unfortunately we could not develop a plan that all could support financially go see our has no cash reserves or meaningful physical assets\nThe dead of approximately two point three million dollars created by new ball ball was too much to overcome economic burden of the debt would not allow go see artificial it's mission expected to be organization\nBy its stakeholders we'd like to thank the current staff of go see our for their efforts especially in the past few months under these difficult circumstances to promote our community and we wish them well in their future endeavors signed Jim had that interim CEO of go Cedar Rapids\nOK so go Cedar Rapids totally dissolved ... as of Monday well while more okay we'll certainly more on this as we had through the next few hours here this morning okay thank you adjusting for bringing that it's a news item to us\nNow from the highly shop for men for solar forecast center here's a TV nine whether update [noise]\nWe go over to Cairo Maryland TV nine were breaking news I had a a whether whether it's not breaking today's wants no that's right so you had to take the position to be out over a totem pole\nThat's fine I literally had just saw an email pop in a second ago and it had something to do with the subject line of that but I hadn't read it yet yeah so uh thanks Justin for bringing up to speed on that yeah that's a that's ... that's interesting that's a big deal yeah it is yeah I tell you what today I took one one report\nI'm from ... from a little something on the windshield\nThat was it and so I don't know all\nRain snow flake something well there's a little pre sip out there and I tell you what the dry areas winning because I just looked at it\nWeather balloons sounding off of the Davenport weather service office\nAnd when you look at the Davenport radar you can see this activity kind of forming a whole right over the dome and in fact from about fifty miles around the radar site it's not detecting anything and that's the good math behind this is the fact that we've got a precipitation being detected a loft in the atmosphere but not down near the groundwork account\nSo it's largely evaporating before it touches the ground obviously there's a little something getting through here and there\nUm but mostly cloudy I think it is more than appropriate for forecasts today I I really can't expect that it's going to do much on there is a little something south Des Moines area and that is touching the ground so our listeners out in central I Will be aware of that\nUm Cedar Rapids Iowa City Waterloo I just wouldn't worry about much forty six year high today tonight partly cloudy thirty for tomorrow partly cloudy breezy at times south west winds will kick in tomorrow and get us to fifty three\nNorthwest window kicking on Sunday and bring us down to forty three for daytime hide and much like this morning there might be a sprinkle later along that cold front but I'm having a hard time getting the moisture up in eastern Iowa to make this process happens so\nAh my big takeaway is a man that is some clouds today clouds again Sunday even in the early next week still some clouds around and then by the time I get to the end of next week it still remains dry temperatures are back into the load even mid sixties possible for a couple of days\nWhich you get that close to October averages around a good chunk of eastern Iowa lowest after I saw this morning was twenty eight and the decor area or lowest and our pinpoint strong net sites was thirty one and okayed are so\nNice crisp morning across eastern Iowa and it's also nice to see the fact that we don't have much wind in the area today either it's extraordinarily light where we have any wind\nThat's being detected worth thirty four right now Waterloo thirty five at least in our airport thirty seven and I will say okay now\nSue at the front has said she saw ... so you weren't on YouTube where you know that was outside or or or window okay\nIt'd be a little something yeah possible there could be a little something trying to bust through here um but it doesn't appear like it's going to be to impact for one way or the other or we can kind of see these uh precipitation curtains if you will from the sky so there is a little something trying to bust through every now and again but I'm just not a not too concerned about at this point\nOkay well the minute you pull up a word accumulation I\nKnow that you're not going to be an issue today at all\nOkay yeah I that's what my ears perk up for winter weather where you start seeing accumulation that's that's the thing yeah that's that's the one former precipitation that does accumulate do you really don't use accumulation when it comes to render you\nOccasionally I Will I but yeah no not really and I'd be even shocked if anything fell to the extent that it would wet a sidewalk [laughter] I think it'll just mainly stay cloudy and that'll be about the extent of what this is going to be capable\nOf for our area okay well we always outweigh the transition that we've had over the course of the month of October I mean it was just a what a ... just a little overweight or\nDo we had that eighty degree day it's just phenomenal oh yeah well and this could also be the process just kind of part to everything just kind of squeezing out the moisture of what it can um the real good moisture still down to ourselves in fact Missouri is going to have a pretty garbage day of whether I'm but where we are you know mainly just some clouds and shouldn't be too big of a ticket item\nHere for us well Pam thanks a lot of time we appreciate it ... and uh you have a good weekend oh yeah you do the same
