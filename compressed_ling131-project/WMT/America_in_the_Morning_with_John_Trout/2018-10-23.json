and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nHi Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I

have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says

he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation the resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something it's not just information visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that hum unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like there was one case in my book that I go over a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm
