likely to remain\nA tropical storm as it moves across the south east we're going to be looking at the center of the storm cutting across the Carolinas for today and into tonight\nAnd then coming up across Virginia by tomorrow morning\nThe center of this storm is likely to end up being all the way out over the Atlantic and at that point it is likely to have diminished considerably\nWe're going to be looking at a lot of rain across the southeast is well this is going to be renewing flooding problems throughout the Carolinas including some areas that are still dealing with flooding issues leftover from Florence\nWe're also going to see gusty winds that's going to be a big problem as well and we can have additional power outages has trees and power lines began to come down\nAs well with the storm moving through\nFurther to the north we have a cold front which is what steering Michael also bringing rainy weather there can be some gusty winds even up through Virginia and into

John trout it's Fifteen after the our Democrat spring the issue of health care back to the forefront in advance of the midterm elections correspondent Linda ... has the story\nThe mid term elections are closing in fast and Democrats want to punctuate the issue of healthcare hoping it will help bring voters to the polls on election day they want to portray the Democratic party as the champion of health care and the Republican Party as the one that wants to take it away\nThat helps to explain why Senate Democrats forced to vote on a bill that would eliminate the extended sale of so called junk health insurance plans the fact that they didn't get the votes to support the bill and that only one Republican Susan Collins broke ranks and voted with Democrats is not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic party because it sends this message\nWill keep working to improve health care to bring down the cost of prescription drugs but to make sure that people with pre existing conditions can get that care and we will do our very best to hold the Republican majority accountable for their attempts to undo it\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan says these policies which are part of the geo peace effort to undo Obamacare don't cover much and they certainly don't have a pre existing conditions\nWhat were you really are seeing from the Trump Administration and Republicans is an absolutely relentless attempt to got protections especially for pre existing conditions Republican\nJohn Cornyn says that's not the case\nProtecting patients against pre existing conditions something we all support but basically the the misleading argument we're hearing from the other side is the only way you can do that through the Affordable CARE Act the Affordable\nCARE Act or Obamacare does cover pre existing conditions and Democrat Chris Murphy says the low cost insurance plans that Republicans support and not worth the paper they're written on\nI think it's really sad that we couldn't draw more than one Republican vote for a measure that simply says when you sell insurance it should actually be insurance\nBut Senator Cornyn says the insurance he's talking about is all about choice\nWe need more choices for consumers so they can fight healthcare twice they can afford and the suit certain age\nMurphy says the so called junk plants don't serve anyone's made by the way we just passed\nAn opioid fill a couple of weeks ago let's be clear about one of the key insurance benefits missing from these junk plans addiction benefits\nMeanwhile I debate over these non Obamacare policies continues Democrats further accused the Trump Administration of attempting to dismantle the Affordable CARE Act in other ways the administration has announced that it will take down the Obamacare website for maintenance for up to twelve hours every Sunday during the open enrollment period\nThis will make it more difficult for people to sign up for Obamacare plants Democrats call that curious that
