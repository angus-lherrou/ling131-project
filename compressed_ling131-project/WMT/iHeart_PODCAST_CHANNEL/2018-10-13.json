know what we're going to get this kind of like that box of chocolates you know you don't know what you're going to get when you bite into it and I thought I feel like we've been into\nA scenario here that's starting to really kind of work I think he's really kind of coming into his own I really like him on the sideline versus being in the press box I think he's more connected with the players he's more connected with the action of what's going on is able to predict a lot more\nIn terms of what he wants to do so I like Brian ... is a good friend of mine and um\nYou know I think he's a solid

Hawkeye huddle Hey Tom\nHi there I'm enjoying the team the I think the point in rural weld together but my point goes exactly what you guys were just talking about but nine minutes left in the game I'm Wondering why next analyst Phil stand on the field is our quarter back with this thing wrapped up\nWe have a quarter back on the bench that needs to play\nAnd a NATO one injury away from having that guy on the field and I just wonder why we don't have\nSome game experience some real game experience at our backup quarterback\nYeah he's gotten in missiles got me in a couple of times um I thought that was interesting about today though Lou and that uh it was neat family all the way Tom thanks a lot\nYeah [noise] yeah I really think I'm just shows you the loyalty to close friends I mean we've talked about this for years now I mean why isn't the second string quarterback in the game my eyes and the second guy getting an opportunity and and either\nIt's just the advancement of the playbook wouldn't play calling but you know this game was pretty much out of hand um or well within our hands are leading into that kind of the last few two minutes of the game so\nI'm not certain I don't have an answer for that I have to apologize that don't have a true answer I just have my opinion in my opinion is that close parents are just very loyal to his starter and we saw it I think CJ there was one game when the day better was here that\nI think it was a bowl game ... where he was very very visibly injured ... injured yeah and he kept him in the football game yeah and I I just don't I don't understand it it didn't make it doesn't make sense but\nShe just wanted to play in that particular case so I had a little different Trevor those in this where\nI was pretty much got it wrapped up they're going to be back with four minutes ago it was just a matter of killing that four minutes right\nWell okay from what I from from now\nThis is me thinking as me and what I Would be doing\nRight um when when I saw what we were doing I said this is interesting working on something all the commentators were saying hey there must be some bad blood there still passing the ball\nAnd to me it looked like we were specifically checking certain things in games speed with say opposing defense that that was game ready defense against us and ... and then maybe you know\nYes normally you would take that time let your backup get in there get his shots take it shuts down the field but it really did look like we were working on something they're\nAgainst somebody of scout came absolutely yeah yeah it's hard to replicate that in practice\nOh yeah I mean how how often does\nIowa throw the ball and we're up that far [laughter] yeah yeah that's a good point I don't know I thought the last throw as much as killing time might have been about you know not accepting that ten seconds runoff uh-huh penalty but uh\nI didn't think there was bad blood though like there was ... it didn't seem to me like there was like something like that you know we're trying to be jerks it really did to me look like there were a few processes that we wanted to work out with that passing game and we were trying them\nMay need to get ready for Maryland yeah maybe later on down the road which you have this Maryland team of those slouch certainly asked the longhorns how that one though [laughter]\nI don't think I actually I was calling about like the\nBig five or six hundred eight hundred fifty ... start six hundred dollars a year like he's got a ... right after this from Hudson ... outside that

reached the midpoint of the regular season for the big universities and division one and they got that done\nHave matured they're comfortable in the position they're comfortable and even moving around and to some different positions that they may not be comfortable and and\nI just get excited about talking about these young men because they they uh they come out with a high level of emotion but more importantly here's the fundamental thing about Iowa is that everybody in the country now what we're going to do or what they do and and that they then they don't they don't\n... we we are given that we give them the same look you can say\nThat all you want to but I Would you have to have a hundred yard Russia that year but do we need it but that's my point\nWhat are they going to do they're going to try and come out in or out his ... around the football except this year it's been the deep passing in\nThe passing game and yeah that's what happens when you got a really good quarterback I mean I don't know I thought that smile from traveling I Know [laughter]\nWhat\nOh they've got it I Know he's got a thought ruin\n... it's not ruined already dropped them Andy awhile ago yeah

cars and a little bit of student loan left cool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off in the car got us into the travel\nOkay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right um other one is going out and we decided to bang for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we want in probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was the and we're just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drew me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children having a future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught and taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's ...\n[laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be dead for a one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do it\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them well\nThere's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nThe main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally drew okay so I think that they need to focus on why they're doing it to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it his way but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward", "show_name": "iHeart
