Parker history or Iowa ... line but er the game here is Marilyn head coach Mack Canada\nRight job Iowa a very very good football team or go for instance a tremendous job appreciate the way they play the fundamental\nSoundness they had was an entire football team always have great place to play a great environment to play in um obviously we didn't play on all things with the same soundness we had only had three driving in the first half\nI'm the first one in ... the second one started with a penalty\nThey're winning and it was a turnover on defense they had we had that for Syria to defend them to feel goals you got the one touch down late there and then we got on the ... so they did a great job but obviously the ... was windy and I thought they did a tremendous job of managing that run the ball and get moving stand you'll get in the first person down\nOn all things we didn't do that and you got to defensive guy sitting near\nOr depends on the field a long time we've obviously got to get them off the field a little bit they they did convert some third downs but on all things we've got to play better and it comes back to sound as it comes back to the to not shooting ourselves in the ... so that falls directly on me and I will do a better job and we will come back next week and we'll play sound her last\nThat looks like to see them actually got also these sort of flow\nThose conditions I [noise]\nYes there were a number of dry [noise] that\nIt hurt if or\nDoes that play into you know what your office where you have especially in a\nHave many flights because he\nHe has to make poison um you know I think as a quarterback when you sometimes you feel bad ball and a guy makes a great catch and you have to realize you through a bad ball and then sometimes you throw a good ball and I mean he doesn't catch you can't you know every place and exploit you have to\nYou know your mind is the most powerful thing in our body and if you don't see yourself making a plane and you don't make it so I thought he went out we I think the first passed we got also got a first down on the first play right to uh to Jarvis and a nice playing games from the origin um\nAnd we went down to thirty three and actually under snap that feel like we had a good play they're coming up so he said it best on you have to make place that's what it's about and then\nUm we didn't make enough on often and again I I'm really proud of our our defense play nailed them sixteen points right that they gave him seven what would you know they got we got to get them off the food a little bit too and uh but they you know it just wasn't a very good day for us on all sides clearly\n[noise]\nWait a minute drive more\nI don't know I don't know I mean we do we start we couldn't jak has said the first guy was a snap a second drive we got a really good play the got called back because we all start\nOn the third drive we got a couple of first towns in went through the interception um so you know shouldn't have shown it ration accounted if we run it and running up the mental and that's not good at is what it is but the first time for only had three drives and we were down we were down six and we were down six\nSix zero was was not much time left and they went on and made a play um you know and and to get it the third team are still at a chance to win out during the second half and\nAnd uh we didn't get going and obviously we had to turn over in the end zone which is just completely unacceptable than a disappointing so um [noise] it's too bad for our defense he had to\nTake some of the nation was we had to just to use the motion and just didn't time it up correctly a demotion guy with the ball and put it on the ground so we had two more Turner was on office today both with the quarterback so we have seven turnovers on the year for all the quarterback position as far as sort of touched on it\nSaid was losing my fears it'd be you know\nOf circumstances it would be you know it's hard to have you have to stay together with what's going on in Maryland\n[noise] you know there's a fee for reasons nursery coming out of the primary is that make it\nHarder or and how much more challenging there's going to make it as a coast not knowing what was going to happen\nOr not knowing even when it's going to happen\nRight I think you know there was a million answers to that question down and I appreciate the question but the answer is we're going to get up tomorrow we'll don't worry about the football game that we just lost I'm going to do the best job I can do much today like

[laughter] [noise] why should ever\nAn alley [laughter]\nLoves the it's a packed house there was a pact that was a gimmick even on a tough day and that's a great thing about Iowa fans will come out on soft say you know what I mean I support our hawks\nFew things that may be concerning and we'll get to that as we go throughout the course of the day today and including having settle for fuel goes on three different drives that\nMaybe should ended up in touchdowns the Maryland she tends to come in I'm fairly talented too that wasn't the issue is the fact that they thought they were going to deceive Iowa defense running the ball create big place and then when that didn't work they've got a hundred and twenty fifth best passing game in the country so things ... [laughter]\n... yeah but remember this is the team that beat Texas Hi Stacey\n[laughter]\n[noise] thirty six five or six hundred and eight hundred three hundred and fifty four oh one works are sick\nAnd you know what what's even better is if if Texas wins out this'll be the team that keeps them out of the final four how old are you also say that about Iowa with guys and when I was real true true true that ah [laughter] how bad was Texas that day we know how bad Maryland I mean they might have been asleep [laughter]\nAlso came to watch the temple so I guess that works both ways very six

thought maybe one of the best things\nOr or fun things to here was Matt Canada after we're talking about this guy football team\nIs a very very good football team comes first as a tremendous job appreciate where the point is\nThat a ... always have the game for probably a great environment to play you know obviously we didn't play on all things with the same yeah there's something that we had only had three drives in the first half of the first one in ... when we started with the penalty for running with a terminal [noise]\n[laughter]\nHard to win football game is doing that but when the defense plays like it did and [noise]\nUm [noise] there's a reason that the things went that way Trevor [noise] well I I honestly I'll tell you the truth I think half\nThe reason is because the often did what they did when you're standing on the sideline on a cold windy day right all them little bumps and just started freaking [laughter]\nThings start freaking man and they're not they're not lived up anymore like that whole warm up you went through you got to stand there Peter instruments and you're waiting for your chance it's getting longer and longer you look at it\nAnd I know a man can also be I Know exactly what you're talking\nAbout a year or so that now you got to go back out there next to you and you're ready [laughter] you're an idiot [laughter] right so it's going to take about two or three places to get a semi lather going but you wouldn't even the water even on\n[laughter] you got that so yeah no they don't run to the door for [laughter]\nDo you got to go all that you gotta you gotta get online and like order it real quick I say they deliver right there you go to flip the water on and you look at it upside down an empty bottle it it's not good so that's I mean a lot of that [noise]\nNope no discredit effects they did an excellent job but I think are often being on the field grinding these guys down wearing them down and they're keeping their off and on the sideline hanging out how to do with that\nWhat the thing is is like they're a team that you have to compete against all the time especially if you're Iowa because they believe that they're better than us and we believe we're better than I mean that's a fight and it's a great one right we have a lot of fun with that rivalry mhm um when we when it's a lot more fun certainly well you know\nThat that was only ... normally buying the blessing in disguise thing here for the last I actually am because like it's kinda like smelling salts ice pop open real quick man I pop open\nQuick when people start getting some places yeah loss that you should a beat yeah makes you really understand what you're\nAnd one yeah I I Am what are your thoughts you know I'd I'd not ever sure [noise] that I'll ... I'll watch the blessing in disguise and I go back to the twenty fifth to for this [noise]\nAnd there were a couple of games northwestern was one of 'em Indiana was another one that I Will probably had no business winning but good teams find a way to win\nClose games right okay so this this I was getting\nBetter we know they were getting better [noise] they were continuing to improve their is you know even her parents at that point in time is out there saying hey we've got something that could be pretty special players were having a lot of fun they were talking about hey we've got you know we we have to keep working but [noise]\nWe got a lot of potential here which nobody of the program usually says right right [noise] ... they were letting things you know fly a little bit more than they they usually do for the team was getting better they were taking it seriously they were working hard [noise]\nThat was happening [noise] regardless of the law [noise] this improvement would have happen regardless of the law [noise]\nFind a way to win the darn football game now whether it's going to matter we'll find out you know it was even plays out in Wisconsin either wins or loses out the term is what I Would make sense\nWell I Can't what I'm saying is you're yeah I appreciate you being overly fleet today [laughter]\nNo I'm already or you're overly today and that's fine but don't lose sight of the\nBall either no man let me as a man that's\nWhat I'm Talking about you know I ... I Love the fact that that you took the analytical approach and said hey you know a loss of the last ... goals in the in the losers column but what you have to look at it that\nYou know sometimes having lost particularly when you when you don't I mean when you got a program like Iowa has and you don't have a a program this fact like Alabama where you've got all these\nYou know [noise] you know five star recruits\nYou know sometimes the loss of wake you up it's kind of like a slap in the face that's my point though they didn't let them in the faith in the wake them up me like oh wow I got\nThere weren't getting better they were working hard they weren't just going through the motions [noise] well um\nWe talked about constant improvement on the [noise] well I Am [noise]\nI mean it it I I did my perspective is is this different I mean I I take it like okay if we would have won that game we would've been obviously undefeated up to this point or would we be or what you say we want to [noise]\nI mean because\nWhat we've gotten complacent would we have gotten to the point where we hadn't well that's a that's where we're at where they may it's like maybe we wouldn't maybe we\nDo you think that maybe they got up to Minnesota and a lot of the the the conversation this week that they [noise] you know sort of support your point I don't have it at the ready I Do have it though has had to do with um [noise] when we talked about this on the show [noise]\nMaintaining the momentum understanding that yeah good starts we like that but if the teams that do well in in November that are remember [noise]\nRight so that sort of support what you're talking about here as we can get from place to found\nOne in a hope we don't man because I think even even if let's just say I mean I think we're going to go [noise] and play very well against Penn State [noise] my\n... my hope is that we don't lose sight of a Purdue northwestern and in Nebraska\nAbout northwest thing we don't want to hear you saying and saying that because I don't know\nWhere I'm going with this that are trend has been will win a big game [noise] mhm\nAnd then we'll we'll start feeling good and they will drop down to a level and we get the surprise of it would become the surprise of the country because we didn't play well last year we we write jab left cross ... Ohio State next thing\nYou know it's a knockout blow against ... ... oh\nMan this history I'm In ... and how ... how many years have we gone through that\nYear after year where we don't we beat Michigan [noise] yep [noise] than loose northwest and then we come back in\nI'm ... I work at a seat the\nStatistics is all over that place let me tell ya there's allies of the damn [laughter]\nThat doesn't work [laughter]\nThe completely\nYou know I Know where I Would go along with this before your throat through this this her curve ball in here since ... baseball season still going on\n[noise] um [noise] is that the trend that has led me to believe that this way [noise] mhm so strengthening\nThe trend would be had I Will beat in Wisconsin that a lot of Minnesota the next week could have it would have been some home that we would have should have beaten\nIt might not be next week is what he's saying but down the line we should have been taken care of business so we've been over God [noise] I tell you what I Would rather have found that out and have to be\nRooting for somebody to be with us and now they do have both Ohio State and they left to go so opportunity for them to get beat also three six five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty for one

Joe ah\nBut you can't blame buyers from Kennedy he gets he gets it failed on just a little bit and get a caller that drop the ball that fire strike\nMaybe he would have happened had he got\nThe throwing a few passes out right before he went into the games are but I don't know is there anything that I said that you on a comment about or\nNot yeah we'll take them in order here okay I'll hang up I'm going to say thanks guys do you think a lot while I'm\nAs much as I hate to take these things in order because if we started them a second one [noise] a sandwich performance and maybe you forget about the first which was the full back conversation you know never Austin Austin Kelly look good today [noise]\nNo ... yeah yeah no absolutely I I think um\n[noise] you know it it ... from a quarter of the quarterback question\nYou know really leads me to believe that there's this um\nYou know cut it took some shots down the field but I think this is you know you gotta windy days you got a lot of the ... going on you know they don't want to take a lot of risk right now and restore an interception things like that these guys have been in practice they'd been practicing [noise] um [noise]\nWhen the time is right you know get in and have an opportunity for that when you put plenty more room for that when it comes down to um [noise] you know we talk about a receiver play you know [noise]\nI I really think that right now you know we were just trying to to to have a level of sportsmanship not tried to blow this thing out of the water let's just get this thing over with and move on to ... prepare for for Penn State so I don't know if you go to different ideas [noise]\nNo I you know for ... um\nI mean I was really happy with last and Kelly being back at full backup reps in their banging hard mhm I'm\nThat's right that's what I don't know if it was a mistake free but it was definitely penalty free [noise]\nYeah yeah penalty three football today you know it is very hard to answer your question Andy is um [noise] you know there's a lot of different circumstances that happened throughout the ball game you know you got a lot of different things donate doing a lot of things are happening at a millisecond of time\nAnd kids are having to make decisions within that millisecond\nSo ideally to play an entire game without that\nAspect of it is pretty ... pretty remarkable and something that we should be feel real proud of so\nI actually it's pretty hard to do it hadn't happened in twelve years yeah [laughter] well\nCome on now I I mean\nThe the environment that we're in today I think allowed us to really play mistake free foot four I should say penalty\nFor going to say wait a minute didn't you didn't actually agree on that area\nBecause we made a couple of mistakes we pick right\nAs a ... a well honey post microphones why it wasn't a mistake free but it was penalty free and play it clean game like that I mean we we were in a real house we were\nUm [noise] we're zones locking\nWere driving the ball down the field we were running the ball hard you know finding holes and stuff like that we weren't like you know having to change do a lot of changes direction that causes your own line when it gets old and calls ranks and that yeah\nYou know and I mean when you're able to go on one tell them what you're doing and still do it any way hey by the way we will run right\n[laughter] you know you look at the guy just a buddy\nGoing to block it to the right and I'm a pancake you okay you're ready for that good [laughter]\n\n\nGood and then play count and and it's going to have you on that too yeah I write down say is just too ready to just be ready to hear [laughter] and then by the way there's nothing you can do about it okay so that that that breaks up something that I was wanting to get to earlier but\n[noise] or whatever I have a comes up with this type of the game plan it seems like we conclude afterwards that this was a game that the coaching staff at least was pretty convinced [noise]\nWould be one due to talent [noise] he agree with that Lou [noise] and it just looked in the the Georgia Tech comparison that got brought up had to do with the section but it just looks at me like this was one that I Will went into\nThinking we're better than the guy right we know we're better than the guy and it showed on the field\nI think it was also showed on ... and and that's a valid point I Would and which I agree with but I think also that takes\nBut at the border is that we came out today and said you know allowing our we'd better than you were going to show it in our play\nAnd we're not going to sit back and daily deck with you guys were just going to take care of business and it's always and this and that's why this is why I'm we live with honey is because the day we came out we didn't that Marilyn hanging around [noise]\nWell we tried to the only reason we didn't just because of the total and ask them if they are often\nWell we try we got through a pick on the first ... on the first theory we settled for three field goals yeah quoting a failure on thirty five on fourth down at the five yard line you I Need to remind you the last time that happened that\nWas a lot of this had to do with the weather and we overcame it out to the point is the point\n[laughter]\n\nTo reverse itself I don't know why does that matter of fact\nNot yet made on the five and going forward or the one from the five um that was one of the key plays into Wisconsin when\nAh yes yes Scott loft yes [noise]\nAnd it was kind of I'm
