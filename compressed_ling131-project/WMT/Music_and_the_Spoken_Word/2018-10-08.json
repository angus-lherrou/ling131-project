{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "And finally the devils at work\nEven in their own ... there is greed\nCausing some problems the rich nobles in officials among the Jews were taking advantage of the poor who are having to ... everything to pay their interest in taxes\nAnd try to keep food on their tables was almost impossible and they were working on the wall besides and the kids were being taken away from them as payment and they're they're just not making it so they're rightfully complain near my\nKnee and my takes off after those rich people on their behalf and gets them to give back what they'd taken as well as promised to not take advantage of the poor any longer\nTurns out that even and all of this Nehemiah himself was doing this job for no pay\nAnd to top it all off he dug into his own pockets to fund the workers who are ready to give up the project and quit and the strike was averted\nAnd lo and behold the wall is done completed after only fifty two days\nMiraculous and the surrounding nations scripture tells us in chapter six of Nehemiah were fearful for they knew God had been at work\nHere these words and when all our enemies heard of this all the nations around us were afraid and felt greatly in their own esteem for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God\nGod was glorified before the nation's\nSome pretty amazing story isn't it I'm surprised that Hollywood hasn't made a movie of it\nYet what does it have to do with us though does it have anything to say to our time our day it does\nIt near my as the last of the history books in the Old Testament\nSo we must remember this is another chapter of God's redemptive history that began back in genesis three when God said that he would crush the head of the serpent and in genesis twelve that he would make Abrahams descendants of blessing to the nations of the world\nThis was another chapter this was a time when God's people were disgraced in on the ropes and people wonder what God's Plan lay waste heavy deserted them to make it on their own was this beyond his help and the good news is God did not desert them he sent someone\nA cup there of the king to put things back together again so that his great redemptive plans could move on\nGod is faithful to his people we see it in this story today as I said this is a chapter in a much bigger story or restoration project in the midst of a much bigger restoration project restoration of the world\nAbout four hundred years later a new ... bear will enter the scene\nIs restored Jerusalem and he will pray a garden before his crucifixion father take this ... from me the couple of God's wrath is what he's talking about\nFor humanity's sin Jesus would step down from his heavenly court to save and restore his people he to one day when we over Jerusalem himself\nAnd face all kinds of opposition in enemies as he assured his rebuilding project into this world his father's kingdom\nAnd on across he will build something All right a bridge between God and humanity restoring rescuing his last people and they mocked him and they invited him to come down a few of them aside and he was tempted to give up buddy didn't\nI'm doing great work and I cannot come down just like me and my aunt\nAnd God raised him from the grave affirming the new government in his blood\nAnd the story moves on this God continues his restoration through the church you and me bringing others into his kingdom slowly but surely moving us towards that new Jerusalem that new heaven and earth at the end creation totally restored\nGod's work finally completed and that my friends is one of the great reasons to pray God's faithfulness\nThis story is not so much about ... leadership in power but we do learn some important things to his experiences it's more about gods faithfulness and grace that he has given us is valuable tool called prayer and that he answers prayer\nThis is a prayer and hard work story not just the prayer at the beginning of his memoirs but all the way through the project he's praying praying for help praying for strength praying for protection same remember oh lord\nHe accomplishes great things just got through obedient servant who answers called to serve and who prey this story is for his workers meaning if you're in Christ you and me are\nGod is on changing that same grace and strength is available to you and me as God's workers in his field\nAs the church and mission he still has an unchanging planned to restore his whole creation bless all the nations through his son Jesus and we're the call people empowered by a spirit to serve out his purposes and bringing people to that kingdom so our take away from this near my story\nAs missionaries as servants of God working for the Lord Jesus Christ to bring people into his kingdom is simply this prefers and work hard\nAmazing thing happens with this combination in this order prayer hard work and God's faithfulness got that wall built didn't that\nJesus operated the same way in this day to day ministry and even before the trials and across there was a prayer in the garden of ... and you might say yeah but that wasn't near my as time and the time and cheeses can those things actually happened today let me tell you a story\nTwo thousand ten a group of eight people from two churches fill called the Detroit boulevard neighborhood of Sacramento, California it was known as one of the most notorious crime ridden neighborhood\nYou know all the Sacramento each house in that neighborhood was a place of danger\nNonetheless this group of eight decided to walk through the neighborhood praying overreach home praying for the presence of Christ or rain over violence addiction and satanic oppression they began walking through the neighborhood praying overreach home and rebuke into demonic strongholds of addiction and violence\nOne of the eight former Sacramento police officer in gang detective Michael Xiong reported that each time we prayed over the houses we felt the weight of oppression becoming lighter\nA woman from one of the house is confronted them when she discovered they're praying for the community she asked for healing and God healed or\nThe group soon physically moved into the neighborhood and started what they called Detroit life church\nA couple of years later a local newspaper the Sacramento Bee reported that there were no homicides robberies or sex crimes and only one assault and Detroit boulevard between two thousand Thirteen and two thousand fourteen\nDetroit boulevard has been transformed by a small group of people who began their ministry in the neighborhood by praying around houses streets in parks\nFor the power of seemed to be bank rushed\nKingdom prayer in body is what it means to be faithfully precedent to his presence in this world\nListen me and my favorite position when faced with overwhelming problems in odds was the kneeling position and then he got up and worked hard for me that be said of us as individuals and this is the church of Jesus Christ\nAmen\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[laughter]
