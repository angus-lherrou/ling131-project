{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "And they don't understand and then they struggle with hearing aids because they are expecting the hearing needs to be miracle workers and they're not hearing aids do not help your brain overcome something but I I see people every day and I see people like you that come in\nGet their hearing loss treated and do really well Ninety percent of the people that come in do really well\nBut it's I've seen so many things and I've seen everything that we talk about so when I talk about you know whatever it is type two diabetes or whatever\nI see those conditions come in every day and what what's going on with them so it's it's just something we take very seriously and where you go to get hearing aids is very very important you can there's a lot of places to go and buy hearing aids\nAnd I mean a retail purchase buying the hearing in understanding what happens after you purchase hearing aids is very important it's do I get follow up care what does it cost is is there a cost what happens if something goes wrong with my hearing it what happens if I lose it or\nHow many time should I commend or or what should I be looking for and hearing losses lifetime\nYeah what about what about your mentioning your uh Warren cheese and insurance that kind of thing where you have\nUm soul warranty what the warranty means and this is different every place that's why it's important to understand it it's like is my hearing aid covered\nSo something mechanically goes wrong my hearing aid just stops working you have to remember it's an electronic device something's going to happen All right so if something happens what what goes on what do I do\nOr what you know what what happens well we have a warrant cheated all inclusive and what that means is if something mechanically goes wrong the manufacturer would fix it or replace it unlimited times at no cost because it's part of the warranty are warranties range between one in five years depending upon the product\nBut also when I said our warranties are all inclusive\nThey cover law says well if you were to lose one\nThe manufacturer at least ours are warranty is do we replace each one one time in that warranty period of one to five years depending upon the product\nFewer on in the shower like I did one yep I'm actually in the new technology now because of the the moisture resistant to live on I don't have the nanotech right you can I mean I don't recommend you do it but I I mean I'm at total lack a war his when he was in Costa Rica\nDove in a swimming pool\nWith his hearing aids on last one\nTwo weeks later the pool guy finds him and hands in the hearing aid ah he put a battery in it worked right away and then the bottom the bottom of the pool for two weeks\nSo I mean the the technology is just so advanced in that nanotech but if he were to a of lost it or it didn't work you know when you got to like when he gave it back to and it didn't work\nThe manufacturer would've replaced it are fixed it because it's under his warranty and there is no charge on the on the mechanical part there is a deductible but it's very small in relation to um the purchase of the hearing aid\nThere are places out there that will limit your repairs under the mechanical part or they will charge you a crazy amount to replace it I'm One of our competitors actually charges twenty five percent of the purchase price\nThat's a crazy amount I don't care what the numbers you purchase thing that's a crazy number ours is just to set deductible amount but only if you lose it so that doesn't happen a lot but you know it things happen I mean life happens um so it's just important to understand what's\nYou know ... some places don't explain things very well because they they don't want you to get shocked by it they just want you to make that retail purchase\nBut there's a lot involved to buying hearing aids and because it's lifetime I mean once you have a hearing loss doesn't go away they aren't going to repair it they're not going to surgically fix it hearing loss you know if it's a century narrow hearing loss you're going to have the rest of your life choosing the right provider is a lifelong process\nSo worried about that when somebody chooses the wrong provider and I'm happy it happened with their hearing I\nDon't want to come to concept [noise]\nWe have a we've got to trade in yet we got a trade and so if they wanted to come to concept which happens a lot you know we have places there are there's places you can buy hearing aids really cheap and you get what you pay for there's no service involved in it basically you're just bought your retail purchasing a pair\nThey find out it just ends up not being for them we'll give you a train and we'll get you started with concept because we understand this is a partnership and has lifelong and and we're building a family I mean that's what we're talking about it's it's a family it's you know you can't
