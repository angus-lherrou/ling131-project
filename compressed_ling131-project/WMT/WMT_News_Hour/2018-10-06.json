{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Um but I I use it the the place that really really is great for me is in the car you know now\nYou are folks out there that has some hearing loss you know what I'm Talking about trying to carry on a conversation in the car with any kind of background noise\nOr that there is is difficult so that's where I use it and I use it you mentioned my grand son am granddaughters I use that that way and and man that is [laughter]\nOut because you know they they taught well talk fast [laughter] not too you know I mean there's yeah\nEverything wrong with Congress eight hours probably explain your grandkids there to you know there's not in tune with what they need to do yeah\nBut I I Do use it for that but my big uses with my my wife and their car and we we do a lot of trips we take a lot of long trips we do a lot of national park trips and it is so great she clipped she puts it on and\nUh I mean we're able to carry out a perfect conversation if it has a volume setting on it so you know kind of turn it up or down get it right for yourself to show\nYour you have to remember though ... what do you have to remember she has to remember to shut it off [laughter] when we stop and go to the rest [laughter] because um I have a [laughter] several occasions her washing our hands [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nThere are some of the side effect it I got it you know you got to pay attention to and or you know the beauty about daddy is is that it's not you know you're not tied at the hip it'll work to about thirty feet so it's got a\nGood range on it and that's how you can use it for um watching game so you know you can plug it into your TV and it allows you to walk into the kitchen still hear the game whether you're sitting you know normally what you have to do or in the past was either you missed part of the game or\nYou had to pause it you know or or you know it just was a hassle well now you can walk in the kitchen still hear the game and what's going on even though you're not watching and not miss out on\nPart of of the action you know maybe a big play happened and you can still hear it and be part of that versus walking back in and catching on replays and the same and here's here's\nA I'll just say remind folks again before I make this comment with a Jew or with the wrong guy under and with the trailer park or we're doing a special concept by Iowa hearing aids center program this morning\n[noise] um and I I ... with regard to that comment [noise]\nThe thing is a big thing here is when you're watching someone else you don't have to have the TV Now blaring loud I well I'll say you don't have to have the TV loud enough so there you can hear well which is disturbing to the other people in the room yep because the sound on the\nTV is being as you said streamed straight into your hearing a ... a signal is being sent straight into your hearing it so you're hearing the\nVolume of the television at the same level that everybody in the room is he is very\nOr in your ... or if you need to at your level but you're you're correct yeah doesn't disturb everyone else there you\nHave a lot of folks that either watch he hasn't hers televisions because the volume level is just awful for\nOne I'm so it's just awful for the other person to sit there and try to lessen when it just Blair's and it just makes it uncomfortable so now they're at his and her TV's\nBut they like a lot of the same shows they're just having to watch it in different rooms or now it allows you to get back together in the same room watching the same show but at the levels that you need it and not one level that everyone else has to compensate for it just allows for [noise]\nThe ability to be together again and be active in a conversation whether it's the many Mike or the um stream or or I mean you name it all the accessories but the big thing is\nTreating your hearing loss just so you're back in the conversation you're an active participant in the conversation you don't have to stand there and smile and shake your head anymore or get home you know leave the event and look at your your spouse and say hey can you reek give me the one on one recap of everything that just happened [noise]\nAnd that's fine and good if you missed it you know little things here and there but if they're having a recap basically a whole evening that's work\nThat's worked for the spouse and it will at some point you as the individual say out just I'm not going to mess with anymore just all like you know don't recap it all just you know I missed most of the night and it's not fun you know for you now going out is is work\nFor your spouse it's work because now they have to be an interpreter and explain and repeat\nAnd it just becomes an event instead of just hey you're looking forward to going out this weekend with another couple for dinner church or whatever you're doing\nAnd looking forward to it\nNow you're with anxiety now the weekend is going to it's there's an anxiety to the weekend because you've got to work extra hard to try to be involved in a conversation and you know you're not going to be successful or it's just going to be harder work\nAnd it just takes all the fun out of it the fun of life is just now ... out of it because you're just not willing to treat your hearing loss and just not not willing to accept it and will accept a lot of things you know accept if I Can't see I get glasses and if I Need to go to the doctor for this I go to the doctor for that but\nHearing loss is one of those things that we throw over here to the side and say oh when I'm sixty five I'll get hearing aids and in you know apply for Social Security like there's a a benchmark or a line in the sand where we just accept it and we just go on with it\nAnd we know now with all the health and in the brain in in all the things that go with it that waiting is actually harm you're harming your brain by waiting and it's just we've got twenty two locations it's free hearing test and we've got\nYou know hearing aids at all different price levels that we try to eliminate all the reasons that people\nSay I'm gonna wait I'm going to wait and I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait we're trying to ... you know knocked down all the barriers that we can which is still with us have to pick up the phone and call and make that appointment any one of the twenty two locations again in in you know do it runs down and just take that step and see what difference it makes for you\nAnd we get you go to trial also I I mean if you go in a you get you'll get a chance to try 'em out thirty\nDay one hundred percent money back guarantee their you know you're not out anything so if you if you you come in and do it and you know you find that it just isn't gonna work\nThen you know great than you know we'll refund a hundred percent of your money and but the thing you need to look at it is it's it's something that's going to take a little time and a little effort in a little bit of work but we work with you one on one follow up care is included so you're appointments you're never going to pay for that appointment visit\nAllows you to come in and get the check ups and get to reprogramming and just the two weeks and the little things that you need or just the ability to ask questions and say hey this is going on is that normal and we were here for the process which we treat you like family because you hearing losses for life\nAnd we want to be with you in that journey so you know walking hand in hand with you as as you go through that process\nWill Taylor's been enjoyable being where you this morning I uh I particularly enjoy showing people of about my problem and how they can
