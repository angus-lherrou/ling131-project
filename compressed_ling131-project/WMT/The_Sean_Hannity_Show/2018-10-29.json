program we are going to discuss uh all the financial questions that you have whether it'd be a calling us whether you email them with email us ... come through the tax line no matter what it is in addition to that we're also going to talk about\nScams because scams happen all the time in fact uh the boss was in the years is that going to go in these phone was ringing when he was talking yeah\nAnd he said yeah I think that you know it might be one of those scam calls or something like that I don't answer a phone call if I don't recognize the number of name does not\nPie dough either and I think it's important to leave a message but yeah we'll talk about that the second half of the show because it's a\nIt's going to get worse to yeah I really do especially against senior yeah they'll have a lot of their land line yeah yeah and they're very ... anyway no you're exactly that is I think seniors are typically it's hard for them just to hang up on somebody ... pretty easy for us to do it because I hang up and you all the time Doug so\nYou didn't have share that three six five zero six hundred of the local number eight hundred three three to five four zero it anywhere else star six hundred in the U.S cellular here on line or the text line at nine eight three thirty four Ninety eight I'll start off for you guys with the listener question number one\nFrom drew very interesting question at one of those conundrums when is Social Security income taxable\nI guess the first question back is you know is that fair to have Social Security taxable because in a sense it's a tax them yeah it was taken out of your check and then they give it back to the end it's taxed again I leave that kind of how people conceptualize it but I'm sure it's a little more complicated than that [noise]\nUm so we're not here to negotiate or debate whether it's fair or unfair let's just talk about is it possible that your Social Security can be taxable [noise]\nI'm In Nineteen eighty four is when Social Security benefits actually based on a certain income level that you're at Social Security became taxable\nUm [noise] and uh in Nineteen Ninety three to add another layer to that so\nUh is it is complicated and it's something that when we talk to people um it's unique to each person's situation because uh the two main driving forces are going to be your filing status and your combined income right and this would be a great\nTime to have our tax preparers here I'm Mike and Jack ... because uh if someone does call and joined us in our kind of a treading on some thin water or thin ice when it comes to what we can discuss because we're not full disclosure tax preparer strike um\nBut nonetheless uh this is something that people come in and talk to us all the time Jonas they'll say well you know should I draw Social Security if I only knew how long had live it'd be an easy decision right because it's sometimes people say you got all of so many years to break even but then people forget\nThat the other part of the equation as the tax ability status of itself joined us when someone throws this out at you and they ask you you know hey when is my associates actual how do you how do you respond to that\nYeah Jeff ... we ... we had a lot of fun a taping or for three or four TV shows or um [noise] the other week and we talked about the fact that uh fifty seven percent of Americans right now are taking their Social Security\nEarly and drew is asking that question when will it be calmer when Ken it become taxable well if you take it early\nIf you take your Social Security early like fifty seven percent of Americans do and you make more than Seventeen thousand and forty dollars in wages in any particular year\nUm the IRS tells you basically dug it's right on the website I arrest that job\nAnd it sounds it sounds like big brother talking right almost eerie\nAh for for Halloween coming out but uh uh the IRS ah basically ah says if you're younger than full retirement age during all of twenty Eighteen we must act one dollar from your benefits for each two dollars\nYou burn 'em and that's basically it that that's a huge tax uh drew that's a fifty percent tax\nSo if you're planning on taking Social Security early don't I I Would recommend probably don't plan on making more than Seventeen thousand in wages now\nWell one thing I always get frustrated with and I speak with people that is that they almost in a way want to say well I only want to work up to the point where I'm not tax I'm like\nNo you want to work if you want to work um don't let the taxation of your Social Security the driving force why you decided not to work I mean\nI'm I think you look at the statistics of sixty five year old that are going back to work it's not just the money it's the social interaction right to health insurance there's there's so many moving parts to this question and I hate it when someone says well I'm just going to work out to this point and I'm not going to work anymore even though they want to work\nThey don't they're not going to work as afraid of taxes I don't do much taxes drive all your decisions when he's selling investment don't say well I'm not going to sell it because I have to pay taxes it's like that is part of the equation but it's not the sole reason why you do or don't do something\n... exactly and if it bodes for you ah well drew to actually wait until your full retirement age to take Social Security you can make up to forty five thousand three hundred and sixty dollars and then after that one dollars deducted for every three dollars that you earn\nUm and then you don't get penalize Doug you don't have a reduction in your Social Security obviously because he waited\nA ... full benefits or age and that's that's a different uh for for a everybody so a lot of lot of factors there but it is a heavy a heavy tax if you start making a a too much uh after you start collecting it\n... and that's one of those things where people use the leash are being encouraged to make additional money except for a lot of people who may seem like you're being discouraged but they're trying to actually encourage it and I mean really [noise] more and more people are going to either choose to or have to take on additional jobs while they're collecting their Social Security at some\nPoint yeah there's some there's some things you can do to kinda maybe try to predict or offset that I mean obviously you can you can pay higher estimates as well and in your taxes but [noise] um if you're at the R and D stage in your taking your uh require distributions out at Seventy and a half um you can do what's called a charitable IRA gift and basically take your arm dean you can direct it\nTo a charity and and just basically I'm not haven't reportable taxable income and and and the cherry can get it as well and not have to pay taxes so that's something that um you can do to a hundred thousand dollars I think right Jonah\nYeah absolutely and uh the you know the IRS is really good they actually have a fantastic Web site\nUm if you're nearing or if you're thinking about drawing Social Security you can enter a the wages and that you had for a ... year and a they'll start sending you letters and a and there's some calculations that that that you can do on the website to see\nA drew if you're if you're going to be taxed or not but it sounds like\nA it sounds like a he's getting close to a a it's a Social Security uh age and he's thinking about are thinking about collecting it\nWell one of the thing to join us ... and again I strongly suggest that no one take our tax advice on the show but right um you could uh make withdraws while you're working if you needed income supplement your paycheck from your Ross accounts and the distributions from the Ross would be tax exempt as long as you're fifty nine and a half\nOr older and had the account for at least five years and that would be a way you could get some money coming in why maybe while you're working and and not have to think about getting into those thresholds where your Social Security become tax will so\nWhere there's a will there's a way to win the right when there's a challenge in these situations the IRS imposes eased restrictions or rules and there are creative ways you can work around them legally randomly legal\nYeah yeah yeah but I really liked that one person that you talked to that said I'm going to take Social Security early because I don't want to I Want to leave my investments for my kids right charity or for myself for a rainy day when I needed I don't care about the taxes I don't care about bright action I Love that I joined it that's why I think when\nWhen someone called in and asked you know deal always blank blank blank and I'm like I don't I don't like always question are always responses when you're watching\nYou may have some that that break even or lose a little ... and ... you have to be okay with that with a diversified portfolio you you're not going to have every investment go up all the time so if bonds\nAre much safer than than stocks I don't think that's an answerable question I Would just say they're different do you want them different because you don't want him to St right because you can have bonds that are safer than others and the bonds that are not well what do you mean by safe that's\nWhat I think you have to ... talk to the individual it's an individual we believe in the bucket assessment cell when we're talking about safe you talking about bucket one two or three well and\nAgain bucket wander your cash bucket\nWhere you don't have probably bonds or stocks in Europe at one you have you know cash and CDs\nMm bucket to your income bucket well possibly have bonds paying give it their interest in you have stocks being dividends but they're probably the lower volatile type bonds like short term maturity or um you know big blue chip stock ... company's paying good evidence right and your bucket threes your long term money\nWell it doesn't matter if that stuff's not safe because that's for twenty thirty right here so if you kind of segment your money into responsibilities that way and to answer this question\nYou don't answer it yeah because there is no answer they there there are different\nI wouldn't say they're safe for their dogs are completely different financial instrument altogether saying there's far faster than I'm All right because you want to take a look at how everything you have to say for example a company goes bankrupt bonds\nHave different standing than other other ... there's a difference and you want um different is I don't want Fonz in stocks to move in the same direction because you wouldn't be able to diversify ... financial behavioral\n... enthusiasts yes because I Love the psychology behind do why people make and that's\nThat's an industry now that is you know in our side of the fence because I Do this every day is just a becoming very a significant and important\nThirty forty years ago Jonas always quotes these you know Australian or these Russian behavioral therapist all their end of this stuff you know in the fifties but it's a cottage industry now behavioral finance is huge and you'll see that one of the smartest people you've ever met\nJonah she is he the son is there is hell on earth that so I have area that I'm not a lot of Jonas\nWho raised honest people so if you're a financial behavior enthusiast them but they may may what if he wants the Internet and just typed in you know ... and you're going to have lots of books and articles and and Youtube videos and all this\nAbout um the behavioral find is it'd be able aspect behind the relationship with money that\nPeople have and they don't says is every shelf for I don't know how many years have been doing this ten years that that the emotion attached to a loss is stronger than the emotion ... game win or a victory or yeah and that that is so true when you look at look at a casino\nAnd all that that's why we ask that investors when they look at their ten different investments in one has gone down they wanna they wanna spend the most time on the one that went down I Know it's\nFunny we were a long time ago we did a workshop and I just ah this was like ten years ago just for fun ahead um somebody had their four one K. statement in there and he was asking me during the workshop Doug\nHe had like Fifteen investments as four one K. and he was asking me well shy you know obviously I Can't answer the question is I don't have a financial plan on but he's like well here's my statement these two are down you know what do you think I get rid of these two that they're not doing well and I just thought to myself\nThat is so typical of what people look at their statements they immediately go all the ones that are down and immediately want to sell right and all they are going to do is repeat bad investment behavior over and over and over because if you sell a loser\nWhat are you going to end up doing by a winter yeah well you know it had the opposite thing you want to do you get ... dying high and if you don't get yourself to sell your winters\nWhich is hard to do ... and then turn around and buy and I'm not recommending is that what you do but it's hard it's hard to think mathematically how you're going to lose money if you always saw winters\n... right really difficult to lose money if you all we sell winters but people get greedy they hold on too long they don't want to pay taxes is a lot of reasons why people don't sell winters but again what typically happens is people sell their losers\nAnd that's really can be a disaster in in the long term investment philosophy if you're continually selling losers because you have to put that money somewhere and you're not going to turn around by another loser right human nature says you just you just demonstrate that you don't know how this works you're probably gonna turn around by something that's up\nAnd what really what the hundred and forty four new people that came into the office last year it would just congratulate him and we thank him for coming in and uh well you're just try to remind them you know if you don't know if you're diversified then you don't know\nUm if you're not diversified and what I mean by that exactly what you said you have if you own all of the same thing it's all going to go up at the same time but it's all going to go down at the same time you know let's let's try to let's try to design a portfolio that matches your stage in life now not\nMarch of two thousand nine when the market started going up let's match that portfolio up when it's ... ... what's what's what's most important to you\nNow the market's down don't let the media fully with that it's it's not down it's it's up three hundred percent says march nights and nine so it's down relative to the last minute and nobody invest for thirty days unless you're a gambler and in stocks\nDrink for another day it was down like point two five percent it's not that I Know it's this oh okay third of the fact and fiction and then we will get to the trivia question ready factor fiction if I don't buy stock in popular companies I'm missing out fact or fiction\nThat's fiction again and really depends on uh what decade that we're talking about in a well let's just\nBefore you even yeah I Know where you're going to go but I mean what is missing out mean I may I ask people all the fun modes of all the time if you don't buy the stock if you don't invest in gold or if you don't do this and is that going to derail your retirement plan\nAnd if someone says well I have to have the stock or I'm not going to be able to retire well then you're in big trouble anyway yeah exactly but ... but if you can ask that say well no if I buy this stock and it doesn't do well I'm Still going to retire on time I'm Still going to meet my income levels I'm Still gonna\nYou know being a really good they didn't go ahead and buy the stock it's not a big deal but do you have to buy stock because you have to have a home run\nDidn't then it's irrelevant whether you by the ... yeah you're in trouble either way you know what I'm saying\nYou shouldn't do this whole thing is if if you\nIf you can't ... yeah I understand what you're saying and I'm like for me I remember we had a Land Rover\nMan costs to repair land rovers huge I couldn't afford to have a Land Rover just because of the way that it costs if you have to have a home run in order to have your portfolio do ... than you been doing it wrong the entire time which is why you needed financial plan\nAnd that's why we don't we don't really encourage people to\nGet involved in the media's fixation with with with individual stock tracking it's very difficult to do I I've been doing this for Thirty years I can count the people on one hand that I Would say very successful and trading stocks individually\nAnd it probably not even count my thumb I mean it's it's a low number of people\nUm you know it's just tough to do this and Modi with high school sewing okay course ... education
