I Am I can play my games on line and tune out [noise]\nI'm so glad I went I play dot com and downloaded the gap in my daily steady restoration I play every day\n\nWe excuse news radio six hundred W. M. t.s Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nIn the mid term designed Lisa let's Tara Fox News President Trump expressed the optimism was just over two weeks into the midterm election I think the Republicans\nAre going to do very well [noise] I have ever give out whether it's driving on whether or not whether it was just I never did the\nHusband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know Ron dissent this about are the great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nThe elements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us in in the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason Brett us that is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips said army tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice costs\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary\nThat we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and the healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes even his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen electorate with a party and\nNeeding to win every one of the more than half a dozen competitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo that we have top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi was her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't ... I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible I\nCan see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall ... Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nMike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we had four thousand people around there in Beaumont at a huge crowd and used it as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got\nThe cabinet issue you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nIt's where you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nGoing off wrote you know the John Deere gator ... eight thirty five and with power steering and\nNow get four hundred dollars off the gator acts you be a pretty ... and three hundred dollars off all midsize acts you be like the gator ex you beat by ... at your local John Deere dealer\nValid from July Seventeen drunk or twenty six some conditions applied see John Deere dot com or participating us dealers for details down by a protest drive today one of ... northeast I have a location or get a quote on line at B.

themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know ... by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men

what are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is\nGoing to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports as even helping the caravan or is make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally and he's now begun the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country\nYou can blame the Democrats ... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary
