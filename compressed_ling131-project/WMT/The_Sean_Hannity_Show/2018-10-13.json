I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rate stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash of about the whole having a hearing and how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the ... the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your paltry to raise taxes take what you got and take away the job to take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about overwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're\nThe ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker and they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel\nYet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations an impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same\nAnd it's all over again with them well I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands were the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do I think they are really two realities\nThere's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat their problems not me and it stems cells are streaming\nMay try that are closer to the extreme conservative stations so he knows that it's not because\nIt's simple no one is Hans within a rifle no one me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I Know I'm a libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York\nOr to promote Hannity office would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\n... ... ... ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still am you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does holding out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it Oh yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make should get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is\nThis is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them\nThat the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just fighting is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely thought she should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times or get on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nWell I think it's got to do that or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two\nYears if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh I'm are full of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYeah but you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes ... you'll have open borders you won't have security\nEmbedded inside every Iowa hunting but I'll Try cats\nAnd at seven twenty the next Monday morning for\nThe word then it by lack\nRadio Henry telling us\nAnd as we continue with Doug shown and John McLaughlin are pollsters just twenty five days from election day um besides running on endless investigation\nAnd impeachment and wanting their crumbs back and wanting to keep Obamacare and wanting to eliminate ice and open borders can you name one policy that Democrats are running on that would help the American people Doug ...\nMake sure that health care is covered for those with a Greek\nZipping by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nIt's just the Republicans as a party of not sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue Charlotte\nThey're all saying oh hold on to what Obamacare So\nWell come my way of thinking what they should say is no pillows see no impeachment of cabin or no impeachment of Trump just work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on health care and continue choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John do I have your support to work with Sean when we find the state or nation for him to run and for the highest\nCould operate we can talk a yes or no he could run out I got ... ...\n... your
