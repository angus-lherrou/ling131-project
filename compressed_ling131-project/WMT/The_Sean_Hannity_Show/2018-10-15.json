typical thing that you'd expect um are we got a lot of the ... we got this election and we're going to talk about it in detail we have the riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd follow them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think is going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set\nAnd I'm not look at the end of the day people who are responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this was going to look back here have Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah Sanders in our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen and if you didn't see it this weekend\nI mean you had a demonstration billed as a march for law and order in the streets of Portland descending into\nChaos as yet rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night yet members of some group called the Patriot prayer\nI've never heard of them and their their black clad adversaries known as antifa using bear spray ... thrashing each other outside

the street fighters Portland police bureau reported seeing the protests\nAnd counter protests participants outfitted in with hard a narco gloves knives firearms earlier in the evening wanting to do something about it\nPolice to to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they are investigating this scene is unfolding amid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines that law enforcement's you\nKnow they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer and anyway a viral video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nSo what do you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that they were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate rally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where you know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but it's getting to the Daily Caller and people members actually vandalized the metropolitan Republican club in New York a head of an appearance of\nThis group Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming it on Donald Trump he blamed the president after ... attacked the Republican

cannot remain the U. S. fascist political system is one of the most Savage institutions in history and we will combat it relentlessly until all free all our free of American barbarism\nAnd in the antifa tactic men's the next day anyway and this and here's my point Bernie Sanders by the way the clients to condemn the protesters\nYou've got to understand something here\nAfter all these incidents some high profile and then leading culminating last week with Hillary Eric Holder and others Maxine Waters and what she's been saying\nThis is it it's almost like the people are given marching orders here and I don't care if\nYou're a part of a right wing ... group a left wing nut group\nYou can't turn America into you know riots in our cities every weekend\nAnd I think these the people that all becoming the water is

welcome anymore anywhere what are we talking about Alec Baldwin we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump\nThe way we implement change the way we implement change in America is through elections which change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way or the former way an awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [laughter]\nDonald Trump's not on the ballot but certainly Congress's we have more evidence that they want to manipulate where their voters this year we got a lot to get to now we're gonna go over all the polls coast to coast we have some deep state updates now Glenn Simpson he's going to plead the fifth\nI Am telling you the puzzle is almost complete about the deep state abuse of power and it is one ugly site will update that with you with Joe diGenova Victoria tons again Jason shape it's today\nI thought wow what an impact wedding him along when I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back in which I mean they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than\nWhen we just had with Michael Pollan says that they saw him in the house and the what if I may scientists who say it's worse than having a\nShow me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda that's like camp telling them just also have a political agenda\nWhere was that angle of the the altered climate change data\nIt's science was as the Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect is no disagreement than the scientific humidity it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nBy the way the job of stories listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind or am I why don't why no and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right\nOff of all of my my interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted to debate him\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had near record snowfall and the reason why\nNorth Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold periods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties\nAnd nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal snowfall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so in order to ... is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking the\nHigh about five six years ago then they came down below in their back your normal now let me let me say this\nIs the president answered the question perfectly here's why up until now climate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change\nThe climate is always change naturally I feel now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how it is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now\nOr you know whether ... anybody else better than anyone else I mean ... when you look back at the earth temperature as they go out and cooler than warmer and them warmer than cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me give Leslie for\nIf if she flushed thing if you're let's say we'll give you for example intensified more rapidly than Michael right off the top of my head Nineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame eleven days across the Atlantic as a tropical wave forty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty mile an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane or a category one to a category

hours before fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless\nExamples of rapid feedback development it was a textbook case for it and it's amazing watching this go on in front of my eyes of people say how did this happen how to ... its way out of my classes at Penn State Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies\nThe top fifty percent pay all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution\nThe bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is it

for the middle class that's a lot of money one in two thousand dollars and they say you want the crumbs back is ridiculous\nSo there's a lot going on this election and twenty two days now I Would argue that well your tax savings is on the ballot the American economy\nIs on the ballot are great comeback is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs and future is on the ballot your wages and for one case that's on the ballot your business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nIn all the biggest challenge is who's in charge of the future is it going to be close to ensure were or
