some\nEr an hour to Sean Hannity show glad you're with us eight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number eight days till election day one week from tomorrow that was the president talking\nAbout the Pittsburgh should have gone to synagogue shooter um we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill and anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel ... the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA\nUgh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well\nAs soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular ...\nI go there to shop and to dying and down in fact my son told me just about a month ago that for the the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds there's an interesting side note that there was an all throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with the dishes racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with ... and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nA ... any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling it's Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate abomination what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things I looked at this Linda ... praises\nOr day are terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she hasn't praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nIt shouldn't be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that our average would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree we we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with ... shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan\nWas one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral and even that I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find me here too and it's something I like your listeners to know because I I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate\nRight here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the murder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination of your influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three years you're working your policies have\nInviting theft and involved in this\nAnd the you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls from listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all that bend the artist\nRight as we continue roast tenant and David shown you look at article after article in the Washington Post\nRose tenant you know saying that the timing the president to the Senate gone synagogue mass murder\nAnd and that's insane ...\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you shine oh it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love the rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please con heat with not objecting at all to the president's it which I appreciate and when we start focusing on this flame game which is what we do especially the the let media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happens to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those\nWere the words that were true and ... and he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are an amazing I Love these guys I Know so many and then they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a document ...\nWho went to care for gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth\nThese were not acts of the nation divided that's what the last month that the way the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off them branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and date as a nation I Know you agree that we are a nation we are not divided\nAmen ... most of us or not but the blame game ... interests and yes and it's All right well thank you both again a rose our thoughts and prayers to all our friends in Pittsburgh and to the community in\nThe synagogue and a rabbi please send our loving in regards and our prayers um\nEight hundred nine four one shown toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program eight days till election day how do we get out the vote we're

bit term election\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number of the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats at two o five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly uh ... thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature

them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership and Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a\nBit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question right on the Mark I'm in the actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to uh over the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies that well\nI may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with\nRadical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity as mountain seemed to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to get them I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply hub of really as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nI've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know a million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but we can't take in the world's population and we have\nIf they have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just described age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border\nWe are supposed to allow me to ... billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot\nWe often maintain control of them yeah\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred

they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked in a two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't

Gina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse and the echo chamber if you've ever

hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate you know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results\nIf you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four with the media again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful\nIn other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid or leaning Democrat and has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seats difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that could swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you could check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference as if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch go back the media in twenty sixteen this to five Fifteen they were guinea\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to the next president Frank once was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say\nOr do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the GOP not only won back\nThe Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide our members of the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to\nGive away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it\nBecause you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will\nLose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty forty no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the GOP claimed they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nJust listening to win one thousand dollars every hour week days from five AM to nine PM right after the top of the hour
