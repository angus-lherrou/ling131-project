[noise] yeah and I would say running back or three of the positions that we feel like we uh [noise] you know I have multiple players complained going there and really play effectively\nTJ lead you in charge I gained at the position of course no it has the [noise] the four touchdown grabs the sheer\nNature Stanley that that's not a bad place to go up here the quarterback as you continue to develop a wide receiver [noise]\nOn a question and ah you know that that's something we've seen over the last two years that progressing [noise]\nUm you know I Know it got his feet went a little bit two years ago and then last year had a good year teacher Richard uh two years ago and\nNow they're nice shovel Asher is the first year player so you you just hope every player is growing incrementally or whatever every turn of the season that type of thing and um those guys are both on that they've been really nice job and it does it take some pressure off everybody else and\nUh you know when we're playing while we took we spread the ball around a little bit so that the fans can become cancerous load up on one one particular individual\nTurkey flipped things a little bit at the beginning of the by we go you did a lot of the heavy lifting\nThe first two or three days brought the writers and got some heavy practices in there then gave them some time off of turned to the back up so the youngsters are those are the inexperience to to get a lot of reps in that that was a that was planned that was by design for any which way so\nIt's it's interesting or no probably you know you you look at everything as your program goes goes along and [noise]\nUh you know we feel pretty comfortable and tell pretty comfortable last year where we're bull preparation and our approach to that's changed a little bit over the years uh certainly did after the first Orange Bowl we we just had a disastrous games so we were really a liquid that hard [noise] um but but times have changed too you know now we play after Thanksgiving\nSo my point there is it like you know we look at every phase of our program for obvious reasons but uh the by week things it's always a little tricky and uh there are a couple of variables what what time of year as it when you do have your by a ... I think it was Thirteen we had to buy as a whole different discussion\nBut what time of year is that we're we're kind of ... that turn all those types of things so we we did spend a lot of time on that back in the off season has a staff disgusting things or through some ideas that our players and then you don't want them going back and forth on it but yeah to your pure point [laughter] ... we we tried to make the I'm\nThinking like a new normal game week if you would [noise] uh we did a practice Tuesday and Wednesday with everybody or the older guys just lifted on a on Monday that's all they did psychotherapy that's all they did but uh we have to go to work out some kind of split the team up a little bit ... more than younger goes a little bit more extensively\nAnd then friday or had a very like that you'll everybody and then get younger goes out for a little bit more work so [noise] uh they were here friday morning we normally attracts on for autism a a civil breaks to the guys that were [noise] local lot of them one home guys from far away to go home with a partner is that type of thing and [noise]\nThey got back to Sunday but one coming on or usually Sunday practices not very impressive and uh this year one pretty well so what happened but maybe we maybe with something\nThat you found the right for an hour there but it's interesting because you mentioned do too [noise]\nAnd I'll never forget you hit your by week after the last football game because she's yeah up at\nThe Metrodome therefore you did play a game for fifty whatever eight days and oh by the way here's southern Cal go go beat up and the Orange Bowl which\nThat was a good game for a close game anyway for the better part of the two three quarters [noise] uh so you've had you've had to buy a week at the end of the year you've had to your earliest by we care a three four weeks [noise] end of the season I Am assuming there's pros and cons with with\nWith each open window\nYes all look at the positive side right you know to try that essentially that but uh it's interesting last friday or by my count and that's on official was dead center in the middle of our [noise] our town or your for the season starting starting camp for the first friday in August and you know finishing up on [noise]\nUh I guess I've ever restaurant in whatever I I don't know as one next to last one in nova Thanksgiving week that exactly how do you know kind of sits right in the middle of it and we would obviously do more heavy lifting in August when we do any other time of year so\nTechnically the energy our guys wearing spend will be much less in the next day we spend it was the first day weeks\nBut I think it's that's a good point and then you know we played enough or we have a pretty good ... team [noise] not not that we're there yet not that we have all the answers are in the I think we have a good picture of what the guys look like a game [noise]\nSituations tough situations and gave us some things to focus on his coaching staff players something to focus on and [noise] you know we certainly a purpose with our practice last week and then [noise] um I really like works that is right now and now we've got an eight week season and\nNow I'm trying to make a last time he played an eight week season in high school it's probably been shifted years but [noise] you know anybody do anything for a week so [noise] uh you know we should be for us we should be arrested we should be able to ah [noise] you know ... to give our best for the next day weeks and that's that's really the task to him\nWe'll talk Minnesota specifically here as we we press I Want to go back to the Wisconsin game um I really liked what I've read Kelley Martin showed that they are and and that's from a kid it was a quite a hundred percent yet these should be pretty close now but man I tell you he he brings some extra weaponry to the to the arsenal if he's healthy\nAnd just on and on the answer just talking about our backs you know we pay we might have the widest group of ... you know at least they are in the building all three of the guys are a little bit on the ... areas doesn't say a lot of the boy I tell you works are in the essence he's gotten here\nHe's really impressed that it's just that the way by goes about his business or what have you a tour and is a very energetic um [noise] you know tough minded player\nBut again not not outspoken herb oysters just to us about his work really impressive land because jumped in there and done the same thing so it's a really good about the group of ... got a good skills good skills that\nNow he's a little stronger in little tougher maybe and think he is and he's pretty nasty and uh you know just kind of knows how to how to do a lot of things pretty well so he he's also a really good start and I would say the same about the other two guys as well [noise]\nHopefully recall of that is a legitimate three headed monster\nBy the end of the season but it's certainly gives you some options there are let let's shift out to the wide receivers because that continues to be a worker progress you gotta ... that are set back and I know you enjoy having his beat out of the boundary you know he's\nA little bit more mature physically then he was a year ago certainly and um you know as these ... he's still a very you know all the guests were talking about her young guys all three of the ... the young players a hybrid as a young player in my mind Brandon Smith you know you're right down the list so [noise]\nUh you know we've got a lot of guys that don't have a lot of experience but they played a lot Stanley's young player and [noise]\nAnd you know those are the only player in my mind and a teacher so\nI think all these guys are doing a good job the receiver\nUm the quarterback is young [noise] a first year player but I'll tell you smart enough to go outside of those guys and difficult to them and they are they both are very very dangerous to outside guys walk as an older guy the other is that your first one number Thirteen and [noise]\nYou know I think one of them are and I think twenty two times he only got twenty but those aren't just top officer\nThey're throwing the ball down the field and that's their bread and butter because they've lost her ... to ... to season ending injuries that health Rodney Smith a ... so I thought it was like all those guys you know their early ... foreigners than\nUh that you know it's a big loan you lose two quarters elder [noise]\nTyler Johnston is the junior receiver you speak of ah [noise] and he's a big guy sticks to about two hundred and five pounds he's from Minneapolis [noise] he's got twenty two passes average is Thirteen and a half yards and he's got five touchdown passes so obviously ...\nYeah he he's been very productive for them he was a good player last year as well\nAnd I think you know we're talking about are having some balance our came over the last uh you know a couple of comments that were talking about that and [noise]\nUh I guess the thing that's what their teams that to them you got two guys that are really good for us\nUm you know he's a true freshmen out of George\nYou know he gets down to feel pretty pretty well makes a lot of places to seek interested on\nOn a number six you know you've got a tumble these guys that were\nShot the moon is is the true freshman used because they've always got the titans are they have again this year they've got to a number of freshmen they're playing a white out along with the title or just the junior what about a brace Williams is a youngster from Florida coach entail back they\nMoved him in there they've been feeding him a ball a lot to good size six foot two hundred pure freshman\nBut obviously got some skills\nAnd he's not a good job and I came in Maryland game and ran really won the second half so you know he's he's quite a tough front strong and then twenty fours a solid guy too but Twenty one seems a little\nLet's go to the phones on the on the line we haven't talked to Tommy in a few weeks he's got a question or comment I timing [noise]\nHow long and the night you know how\nThe game and now well see you again it\nWas actually call it kind of good to hear from you know uh [noise] well I don't know that I was players last longer than the other big tennis schools I mean part of that as a roll the dice [noise] 'cause I mean the average NFL careers like four and a half years if if you can stay healthy or you can last now\nA Riley reset a good run brand luggage had a good around Mike Daniels has been terrific but ah [noise]\nAh you know it's an honor to play in the NFL Marshall yet I don't want to forget Marshall either but [noise] you got a lot of lying to have a terrific careers in ... near ... just retired\nAnd right before Amazon bought one of the place to probably Thirteen Years maybe as a defensive tackle call all that stuff to do in a defensive line you know those guys take a lot a lot of shots from a different direction so [noise]\nUm [noise] I think part of it is a you know the reason they're good players here and we're talking about some of our guys like Corker\nUh yeah those guys just do things they do things right they they show up for work on a daily basis than it sounds pretty Monday in a routine but\nAh the coach in the NFL for six years it's amazing how many I struggle with that they're so used to [noise]\nOr just getting by on their ability and at some point that catches up to you so\nYeah you know being a pro is is much more than being a really good player it's it's just doing things that are on a consistent basis is true in any profession you have to show up and do work in\nA you know to get knocked on you get back up and you don't don't surrender you get back up and go to work and try to fix the problem is that the deal so\nI think our guys are for the most part understand that pretty well when they leave and the um [noise] you know they they carry that with them to the NFL hopefully I Know they've done the same thing on their\nPersonal lives and all that kind of stuff and\nWhere are the only program teaching at all of the salaries\nThe case but you know we've had some really good still are guys on the guys we've all talked about or just a minute ago [noise] um [noise] you know just sort of the great guys too I mean they're really good people and a fun to be with them\nYou know so you like to see him do well professionally but\nMore important than doing a good job away from and one thing about football it's going to end it's gonna pretty soon for everybody so [noise]\nYou know hopefully you a little bit more going forward than just being able to tackle somebody or block somebody say something down talked to a Marshall a a\n... in the spring when he was back [noise] and the and he said he's feeling the aches and pains says eleven years ah [noise] ah in the in the in the NFL and\nOf course a if you are a lineman\nOr you're probably going to feel it more than most 'cause you're getting beat on every step doesn't matter if you're in the old line\nWhere the defensive line or your bank and helmets shoulder pads all afternoon\nThere's there's really no way to get around that and um [noise]\nYeah football's arches cool game [noise]\nAnd uh you know I was told people I said you know the players have really good our uh I mean they are ours are really good or better than yours even okay and um you know if you if you wrap it in the auto season and that's gotten less now than they were ... now than they did when I was in the national football league\nTheir hours are really good there pays pretty good even the worst pay guys get paid really well uh but the one thing the the other part about it especially guys on the answer they get the crap you know um it's a really hard job physically\nUm you know so there is a tool that they all pay and\nUh you know if it's not an easy way to make a living by any stretch and it's a very competitive business than a lot of businesses are but\nYou know they don't mind cutting you and then I fell either telling you it's not going to leave so it's a business trip as part of the deal so that you know those guys go on to their eyes wide open and uh there's always risk involved and\nYou know but you're also can compensate for that and he hit nobody's making you do it it's it's something you choose to do obviously the best at what they do appreciate the call Tony go back to the Gulf or his coach I Want to I Want to say to just leaving Greece Morgan said is Tommy still call\nAnd I said you know we haven't heard from Tom in quite a while so it's good that the atomic all going to get here from\nTommy who's a longtime regular over there in Des Moines and he's a he's a you know he's kind of like an old dog later that we do smarter than he led a game quite well all sports for that in my memory serves me correctly a Yankees fan too so [noise]\nWell I I think his name you know ... and he is he tells you is I think Tommy roots for whoever's winning okay I'll I'll be honest with you but I may be wrong on that count as a Minnesota defensively [noise]\nThat they've had a really good the lines of the last few years to start up ... what do you like about the Gulf or is they have a young guy out there on the end Carter Coughlin is pretty active\nYou know they played him as a freshman he was very heavily recruited a pretty much what everybody and then they can and are pretty much nationally chose to stay home he's a local kid and stayed home with the with the I'll go first and\nAnd ah you know really good player so you know he he to me is like the earlier up front they played him as a freshman uh and he was warning on the job played really well last year and\nHe's earlier up front so\nOr the other guys are are newer guys or to the same thing if you're a good size up there and those guys to play their defense while\nThey've got a ah [noise] always had good athletes at linebacker a Thomas barbers seems like he's been there a few years he's a junior comes from a obviously good bloodlines with Marion barber but let's start with him or what do you like about their backers\nThese are center of the middle linebacker center their defense and ah you know again as you said these comes from a football family is very um looks like to be\nOut of the whole the concert does a good job and\nMartin number Twenty one that outside back because the guy the place to the ... a very good player too and\nCash runs a cutting that's my you know the most veteran group is does linebacker group cash when a new start or this year but it's been a really good special teams play or continue to play along special teams so those three guys really do a good job at barbers in the middle on the east coast to the center of the whole operation there's a big hole in\nThat secondary coach uh at the Maryland game Antwon\nA wouldn't feel the third [noise]\nSon of the great Ohio State player played the league for fourteen years Antwon Winfield uh\nHad foot surgery this week he's done for the year so they uh they've got they've got some patchwork going out of that secondary but wouldn't feel really was the glue guy there intercept or they're going to get her [noise]\nUh he will be missed by the goldfish\nAt stuff when you you know lose and we went through this last or Bernstein or getting under the itself when you lose a guy who's kind of the quarterback back there are clearly leader clearly one of the better players the [noise]\nUm you know injuries are part of the game [noise] uh you know we all understand that but it's really sad when a player loses in ...\nYou know they've got these guys who are so hard for a year round for the opportunity twelve games in\n... it's just really a\nDistorted to everybody unfortunately injuries are part of the game they call football before we take a break your Kirk a question from the audience and the NFL\nShielding by a quarterback or a defensive back his past interference [noise] even if there is no contact\nOur shielding called in college is that I guess are starting to yeah that's a really good question because I'm not sure I Do is understand the calls that are\nOr aren't made so yeah that's that's a good question right there so it is in the college rulebook\nYeah it is not split do contact yeah okay well it's obviously a a judgmental a part of the official has this fall placements we have a question about you know these are smart fans who are the gas when the receiver running back goes down [noise]\nIs the ball place for the knee or body part touches the ground or where the football a touching the ground at the time of the tackle\nWhat the rules are basically that's your narrow bogus one of those touches where the ball is it that given point so it's not where the ball comes down and it's where the uh [noise] you know one of those were counted as being down as as a runner so [noise]\nAh you know those those all those things both those categories like ... can I guess are very they're bang bang plays a lot of times and they're they're very much open to interpretation and [noise]\nThere is nothing like home field advantage just something about looking out there in the crowd and seeing nothing but red\nAnd green

I assume he's talking offensive away and I think you touched on all earlier with the with the the passing attack or what kind of quarterback is ... that is the similar to Nathan in style\nI think that's probably a comparison he's not as experience but he's he's a big guy and a throws the ball and throws it well I'm you know he's he's I Would not describe him as a running quarterback and I guess he's got a little bit of an ankle injury right now but uh you know he should be healthy is that a week off just like our guys have so [noise]\nUm yeah I Would describe him as a tour and more of a thrower and uh\nYou know the biggest threat again I say I would mention is the receivers they've really you know you can't help but notice someone you watch cell number three is pretty good as well lady to also so you know they got a group of guys you got to defend that I'll throw the ball a lot to the title but that doesn't mean you know and they they'll they'll work him into his game occasionally but he does a lot of walking\nA and then the other thing I Would I Would say is the end we talked about this off here but they're they're place kicker is unbelievable he's he's really good I'm just tremendous ... Carter under a punter is not a really good job and then they've got to the fans are going to care about this but they're deep snapper is a veteran deep snapper but he's also a really good cover guy\nWhich is kind of unusual Casey Carter would run down or in quiver get better but this guy is really really good at it so they're they're special teams you answer a very very uh effect of\nWell the Wisconsin game is illustrative of how important special teams are whether you're pulling for the ... of the opponent\nThe carpet there is a solid kicker and you know but ... says quietly put together a good start to the season to he's been pretty reliable for you\nIt it really has a year ago stringy struggled and then last August I thought he really turned has turned the corner were talking earlier in the show about how players you know start to gain traction at some point in their career hopefully and I'm a gal really sort of that a year ago August and and really since that time he has been a really consistent performer eyes or you know an older guy\nI'm Talking about ... the same way an excellent students really committed to being a a good place kicker and he's done a really nice job force\nCoach we got a couple of minutes left I don't want to lose sight of the fact I got a text earlier today that uh ...

occurred before that time in Nineteen sixty when the two played in the third the last game of the season for what would turn out to be the national college football championship of at Nineteen sixty season\nThe championship was determined at the time by who finished on top of the two wire service national college football pools the Associated Press and the United press\nComing into that game Iowa I had been rated number one on both of those polls for the previous three weeks Minnesota was rated number two on one of the polls\nAnd both teams were undefeated if the two games after this game resulted in wins for either tame the winner of this game would win the Big Ten title handle has no championship [noise]\nThe winner would also go to the rose bowl but the result of the rose bowl game wouldn't figure in the national championship determination because in Nineteen sixty the national champion were still being selected before the bowl games were planted\n[noise] it was who was on top of the final regular season polls I was doing\nNorthwestern play by play that Nineteen sixty season and had seen both teams beat northwestern Minnesota six nothing\nAnd Iowa forty two to nothing so was particularly impressed by Iowa I'd seen Iowa captain Jerry Moran run forty five yards for a touchdown and return an interception for another one on thirty eight\n... score on a Seventy yard intercepted pass and Sam Harris run fifty three yards for GD\nForced to have a shift was in his final season of coaching Iowa football that Nineteen sixties season\nThat game and old memorial stadium and Minnesota didn't go well for Iowa that cold and windy Nineteen sixty November day to Iowa ... and a wild centers snap over the Hawkeye punter had\nGave the go first three touchdowns and Minnesota won the game twenty seven to ten\nIowa did go on to beat Ohio State in another big game the following week and wanted season ending game over Notre Dame meanwhile Minnesota was upset by Perdue the following Saturday but beat Wisconsin and the regular season finale so Iowa and Minnesota finished tied for the Big Jim titled\nMinnesota though wound up number one on both of the wire service polls after that regular season of Nineteen sixty\nAnd was accorded the national championship I Will finished second on one poll and third on the other hand was one of the national champion by five other lesser rating bodies\nMinnesota got the rose bowl did because in those days when two teams tied for the Big Ten title is Iowa and Minnesota had done\nThe team that had been to the rose bowl most recently was eliminated and that was the Iowa Minnesota did lose the rose bowl game to Washington but had the national title one on a regular season performance primarily because of its win over Iowa\nSo you're saying the guys had been the winner of that game over Minnesota that Nineteen sixty season Iowa were to have one it's one and only consensus national college football

M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nOver a high court seats I'm rich Dennison Fox News protesters filled the heart Senate offices today and Supreme Court building demonstrating against and for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAlleged assault had occurred\nAnd they did their due diligence and they interviewed the four people and under the penalty of a felony all four people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including professor for one of our best friends\nAnd professor forwarded identified mark judge who's the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons than all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up well in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well\nWell in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have a time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest\nAnyways so they had very limited room to to corroborate professor forward story of what they the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case remember they were never going to make\nConclusions are recommendations that's what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One anyway they sprung into\nAction they went out we had already had professor Ford's\nA testimony now multiple points you know even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate and our test and the account that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post they would not hand that over to the FBI so\nDeborah cats who was the liberal activists attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... come on I was only ten twelve minutes\nAnd that doesn't constitute any type of work for sexual harassment well that shows she's not consistent on the issue that was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nWho's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him a thing that any of this is going on that's the left wing activists lawyer though that professor for it I don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all\nAnyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case professor Ford was to ask for people that are ready testified under the penalty a felony the same questions that you would normally asked where are you there do you have a recollection no no no no no and mark judge you you're supposedly an eyewitness\nDid you see this behavior this account and professor ports happened no and after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss\nThe story that already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial and the story been told in varying accounts and the Washington Post and when professor for testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt wasn't that hard a job for the FBI Democrats as oh now the fixes it what are you talking about what what else can they do at that point\nWhat other investigative tools they have if somebody makes a serious allegation about a a\nSerious crime committed\nAnd they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it the person that has accused denies it there's no other\nVenue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into but they went further even though the New York times had well a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez is story this is the\nThis is the case that happened that was printed by the New Yorker member of that particular case and in the ... case she was claiming well back then the first year when he was a freshman in college said he exposed himself to me\nWell after the New Yorker piece came out in the New York times they went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all and then the attempt to corroborate the story of Mr Amir as New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody\nTimes doesn't like Donald Trump and then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr cab and all was the one\nWho exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add to it\nHer own admission achieve quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening\nSo the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories and of course we've got your number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick\nAs soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time on her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News because she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and\nWell they couldn't find two of the ones they wouldn't respond one of his dad and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person\nSo that story fell apart and you had an ex boyfriend that had filed a restraining order against her and I'm not going to go through a whole bunch of credibility issues that she has you know I have a lot of facts evidence of what she's saying is not true at all from a former boyfriend\nAnd well anyway and that was the third allegation where are you supposed to go\nFrom here I remember Mr sweat neck was claiming that on a regular basis almost weekly weekend basis it almost happened on the weekend basis that these boys including Brett Kavanaugh as a teenager in high school that they were regularly happened off\nAnd almost every weekend she was a time of the parties that they were literally drug in girls against their will\nMaking sure they got an ... capacity hated and that\nThey would line up in the halls of the boys and the boys would then\nGang rape these girls and it happened again almost on a weekend basis and then it became in the interview well I don't know if he's by the punch shy but I saw him give out red solo cups once and I saw him near the punch bowl and\nLining up and the ... I I didn't they weren't exactly lined up in the hall but I saw him in a hall\nIs just not anything that would hold up anywhere under any significant scrutiny\nAnd the FBI has done the best that they can do and it's interesting that all the people that have been demanding all these FBI investigations they don't want an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd number two guy at the DNC always now thinking of resigning his position as the number two guy or the DNC not one person not one Democrat angry today that the FBI investigation didn't go on in in perpetuity\nAnd that we're going to get a vote finally on Saturday up or down to if judge Kavanaugh's if we if this is what they have done here\nWithout any corroboration in any case and I'm not even talking about the outright lies that we're told and stories that were created and pushed into the media\nBut if you if we're now going to convict people based on accusation guilt by accusation or as Spartacus Cory Booker said well I mean if there's enough accusations either we can't put them on the court well based on\nHis own words when he was a teenager which I've read on this program you know it was a belong as a U.S senator\nSo my hope is that beyond the vicious parsing rancor that is going on beyond\nThe accusations we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and also when we ask ourselves the question is this the right person to sit on the highest score you know land for a life time appointment Paul mentally [noise]\nWhether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the false mentally enough questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate\nI mean just based on the allegations is that the ... this now the party that doesn't believe in the constitution the rule of law due process presumption of innocence and this is a guy that admit to being\nA jerk when he was a teenager because he wrote about it and where are the calls to interview have the FBI interview Juanita Broderick all the same people sanctimonious as they are upset and they are if we allow this to stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower to do forget that that's one of the ...\nThe lead lives agree about delivering it all\nVery concerned about the FBI but down there along the FBI is on this side of the FBI sides with the other side no I no longer\nOr they just to follow the law and said stop being political and stop using the the powerful weaponry of intelligence to go after the American people that is to me is I you know very civil libertarian of anybody\nAll right Mike Myers thank you eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number look let's say at the greatest vacation in your life and somebody comes up to and says hey\nWhen he got a time share it and and you can duplicate this every single year of your life for ever and you say you know what I'm going to do that ... this is the best time I've ever had well that every year you have the maintenance\nFees coming due and you don't get back as often as you thought if ever\nNow my good friends loan star transfer dot com well they're going to help you out and you're not going to have to pay those maintenance fees ever again let them do for you what they've done for thousands of other Americans at all fifty states now they're process to get you out of these time shares is done legally and ethically and festival", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "04"}
