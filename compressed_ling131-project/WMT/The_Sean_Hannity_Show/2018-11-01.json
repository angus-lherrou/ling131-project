Bryson Hopkins Hopkins has twenty two catches the sheer\nNow they're they're not putting up the touchdowns or or the production in the end zone that uh to Jay ... no offense or have a a produced but heard minute Hopkins are are both the upper class veterans Hardman is a fifth year kid\nA Hopkins is a junior and they know how to find the end zone but the the big thing is that\nA David ... been throwing the ball so much to run they all more or they knew they had a special player when this get hit campus but think about this she was playing high school football year ago in New Albany, Indiana\nAh they they ... they couldn't have been uh uh uh they couldn't have been convinced that this kid was going to come in and that threw a two thirds of the season that fifty seven catches for over seven hundred yards and a seven touchdowns are catching how they use them on the fly sweep\nA he's tremendous and kick kick returns he's one of the best in the Big Ten\nA he's a big play a guy and he's five foot nine one Seventy five but man can he fly\nAnd if he uh he gets you into one on one situation in an open space or he could put ... on your show so tall task a big order for the Hawkeye a defense coming up on a on Saturday shared sparks is a terrific past catcher Isaac is eco\nHall in the ... I mean Blau David lousy thrown two hundred and thirty passes the allies you send a lot of the backup\nHas thrown it up a forty five times so that's roughly two hundred and Seventy five pastors thrown Stanley's showing for two forty five so these are two teams that like to throw the football\nThe ball to makers have a a veteran a front a four of the five starters returned to the offensive line or from a year ago this year led by senator Kirk Barron he's been around a lot of years a fifth year senior from Mishawaka\nIndiana they all go six four to six foot seven\nSix two to six seven three hundred pounds across the front line uh everybody's over three hundred but left tackle grant Herman's who is two Ninety and he found his way to West Lafayette from Albuquerque\nWhich I Know that has to be an interesting story so it's a veteran Purdue team on off switch defensively they they play for three but\nThey really fly to the football\nOr they do a lot of run ... historically a regardless who the coordinator is that's where Purdue does or they try to stop the run first and foremost like most defenses do but\nI'm seeing more than you care to wear a guy's animal in a helmet and a lot of times it's just things kind of like natives Saturday but sometimes it can be worse than those guys you know um get substantial injuries that way so it's just one of those perils of playing football unfortunately and\nFortunately we're not talking about that kind of case right now good in any kind of if you got to start wearing stuff on your hand that's not good if you're throwing the ball so there you have it\nRight from the horse's mouth look for in a Stanley to be on the line up on Saturday and throwing the ball a uh well uh\nThat said he he was inconsistent on Saturday I think that's being honest uh uh in terms especially in terms of accuracy and we talked about it in the post game show and and and rightly so a Penn State has a very aggressive defense and obviously we're getting in his throwing lanes and\nUh I Know he he he stood up to the TJ Hawkins shouldn't mess on the fourth down which nobody's perfect but on balance what what else did the tapes show you this week\nWell first of all I mean Penn State played well defensively they've got a phenomenal athletes on defense they did not play the ... well for the week before and I was watching it on TV and it was a televised game\nA could attest to that um you know it's funny how sports are but the Indian was rendered surely I'm you know a ineffective against\nSo when we play at I'm In a week two weeks later they're they're playing against the Penn State team that's very very athletic and talented and\nNow they moved the ball five hundred plus yard so that is only about college football you just you know every week the different adventure but the the one thing we knew about Penn State was their athletic town and\nThey do Russia passer ... especially when they got the lead a especially with the crowd noise that's another factor in the U.S Russia so you know they might have thought that way and a good defense and and you know we've got match it so unfortunately we came up on the short end but\nUm you know I talked to more of Monday morning talk to them weekly the kind of pick his brain and he shared a story I used in the press conference yesterday\nA said Chuck normal after a ... game one time talked about Nolan Ryan and he says you know no lines dams on them out\nA the the rubber as always equal distance from the place that never changes or as much time as he wants in between pitches and he touches a ball that's perfectly round and symmetrical football's just the opposite right and ... a quarterback got hit in the face 'cause it in the throat\nAh they don't have a lot of time and you know so drawing from all kinds of such a goal was saying you know so let me explain you know going wrong and throw a million or one time and get a can't make it out of the first day in the next time how do you explain that [laughter] so why wouldn't you think their quarterback might have a tough game or two\nAnd a ... it was a pretty good ... but I didn't know that store is pretty good\nYou probably haven't heard the last of the great stories from Tom more either up that's all keep calm during a wealth of wisdom great orator indeed All right well let's go get settled in here and sip on his coffee for a couple of minutes and talk to the fans as we take a break here on TALK talk with coach parents were Carlos ...

Kelly is twentieth anniversary of ... please come tomorrow if you can't make it in tonight every Thursday it's three dollar jumbled margarita night\nAt all or uh Iowa Carlos so Kelly's but certainly here at turtles so Kelly's in Iowa City let's take a phone call jury and walk he is checking in with the coach ... good evening\nIt well or got\nAround to try to yeah with a Rockies are really a quality young man I was an outstanding wrestler as well as a you know a good football player and\nUh yeah we we chose to try to recruit him and he chose Michigan State so um you know that that's the way that goes love to get every every guy on state that we offer it doesn't always work that way but\nUh to your point he played a really good game obviously we saw that film and made some really nice throws and um you know the Michigan State or all despite a really good dog or the real good game on Saturday\nWhat was the key defensively for the sports I mean blow it had like three consecutive three hundred yards passing games to run do cut a lot of balls but they were short throws a you know they hope he could break and then a a really shut down the running game but I you know Michigan State has historically solid civil\nThere really are really I'd say since two thousand one Marco Antonio got there that that's the one thing they've really built their program on and consistently they've been really good at doing that regardless of\nUh what else was going on and that sets for the most part maybe a blip or two on the radar but yeah they're they're just a very tough aggressive team on defense and uh they make ... make a tough on everybody basically in a you know even the Michigan tape of a you know you if you've watched that game that was a\nThat the score is very misleading there's just a really good defensive teams so you got to give them credit and they made a ... I think the\nYou know the big challenge of Perdue and uh that's true of any good often so football team Marilyn was a different type of team but\nUm you know minimizing those big place and you know they've got some guys that really have some a big play ability whether you want to talk about the running back who's really emerged as a really good player\nOr the freshman a sensation receiver and he's also a return guy so but they have other guys too that are very gifted ... on top of their very innovative with their attacks so they get the ball to a lot of different guys but you know they got some guys you better you better try to contain them or else they're going to all of a sudden they're the run wild run loose on you\nAnd if you're trying to contain them and doing a good job of it they get a pair a couple a couple of tied in to our big and strong and physical and can catch the football and produce historically used those titans\nAnd they do a good job of that and ah you know it's kind of just was was going through today either a state law says goes to a couple of times two times in the third second quarter excuse me in a maybe a little drag widely thing where they brought the guy across the grand\nA quota would then give them didn't score but he got down to inside the one yard line so you know if if your focus totally on the receivers\nIt was a good good plan a you know they're going to find those items to and it's you know you got\nCaught for but it's out there and all double back to Iran Dale Moran DJ knocks once again proving that you don't have to be a giant to

but our need for food and energy has grown during the guys and the Iowa farmed arrows you celebrate America's farm [noise] learn more of a fan out and get some great fan of merchandise visit America needs farmers\n[noise]\nHappy Halloween and welcome back to Colorado so Kelly's talked talked with the head football coach at all guys Kurt parents I often wonder till eight o'clock tonight we're taking your tweets your Facebook posts we're taking questions from the audience here if\nYou have a question you'd like to jot down on a piece of paper or a napkin bring it up well up to ask her about it and we're also taking your phone calls a day seven seven four six four to nine five seven a trucker Jim ... a mole on his way along the interstate on hold for a while how Jim\n\nJim hello on yeah go ahead Jim\nAnyway I just want what you guys are happy all the lane and first of all a little trivia you know as I understand that\nUm what ... really needs is a fully evening which is the need for all states day which is a Catholic holy day so\nI thought it you'll end up a little trivia but I Do have a question a critic question actually and a coach\nOr you know there's lots of football players out there in this country and be on the players and obviously the hospital to evaluate oh man I'm I'm just kind of wondering what process this guy used to first of all\nSort through all the players get it out to a manageable number whether it be a few hundred or maybe a thousand or so and then a mere\n... players to eventually I get it down to the point where your car or for scholarships so it's kind of curious trusted coach and good luck to\nYou know it's it's really involved and I probably spend hours on it and then um you know we we get priority\nHire a hundred people to be involved in it which which a couple of schools in the country actually do that uh I guess one of the rising concerns we all have about a collegiate football but uh it it's a very expensive process and in your point a couple of things are there are just a\nAn unbelievable amount of prospects that needs to be evaluated if you tried to do it from a national standpoint it would take an army of people so I'm most people um you know kind of localized or centralize their recruiting areas we a focus on states pretty much within a you know five six seven are driving\nRadius of of the um University of Iowa City and um you know trying to break it down ... a geographically so every coach has a region he's involved with and then we have secondary areas to that extent\nInto further reaching you know such as Florida Georgia New Jersey states that don't aren't necessarily considered mid west\nAnd I'm probably one of things that changed the most is just the the accessibility availability of uh looking her prospects films\nOr when I was here in the eighties you know actually get a get a hold of a\nA VHS tape or a sixteen millimeter tastes really good prospects ... that was a not easy and you would borrow one and uh\nYou know male factor centers you could after you've got the appropriate people looked at it so things have changed so much with all everything being online so you know we have a a million people we can look at it I'm I'm exaggerating a use your term but not much you know there are thousands of paint prospects you could look at but it's not physically possible so\nNow you're just kind of screening um and then just start winning your way down but it's a it's very uh Geographic's a Center for us I think that's kind of the way we do it and if you look at a roster it's a you know you can tell the areas that we really focus on\nAnd then you may get referrals to for people that you trust people you know are there might be some kind of connection that might make sense for a\nFor a prospect from an outline state that might have an interest in the university and we'll follow up on those two and then go from there so\nYou know just an awful lot of variables guys come to camp we evaluated him in camp just like we've I wait I'm On tape and uh you think of player like Raleigh moss for instance who you know we liked him a coming out of camp last year like them going into his senior year ... saw him live last fall\nA on a friday night and then came back and said hey I think this goes a little better than we thought he was so so that's a big part of it to just live exposures watching watching players and their senior years not not all the guys are gonna be really good players are already committed there are a lot of guys out there right now waiting to be found and now we're trying to stay on top of that as well\nAppreciate the call a gym as always a coach we got a tweet from Tyler Trent who lives down near West Lafayette Tyler uh made it to ... last year and participated in the wave and\nUh he's in a life a life battle with cancer terminal cancer but you know terminals a word and he's uh down near Carmel\nAnd he tweeted in at night he said I'm happy to announce as long as my health allows my family and I will be a cheering on the auto makers that Ross said stadium but uh I'll also always take time to wave\nTo uh the the kids it's dead family children's hospital at the end of the first quarter\nAnd sent along a nice picture of him and I'm assuming his dad are certainly a relative at the game last year a he was featured the evening of the Ohio State Purdue game a great story wonderful young a guy who's in a life and death the struggle with cancer or but he took time to tweet us tonight and told her we really appreciate that\nWe do scholar and wish you all the best that I didn't get to see the feature I think Tom and all they did it but I did a uh see some of the coverage and and ah you know what a tremendous story and I'm sure there's a real a bond there between all those kids and uh you know we're just wish you all the best tower and\nUh you know pretty shady taken time tonight to to join us\nA title trust let's say a prayer for Tyler on Halloween Night it's about you know I'd probably do I don't know two to three radio interviews a week during the season all over the country and I will tell you one of the first things that comes up first before we\nUh football tell us about the wave tell us about him children's hospital of any it is really captured the imagination of the country\nI ah it it's interesting I noticed you Jose ah had my headset often heard wave on wave me and played the between the quarters at Penn State and top of that to them further you know just acknowledging that but\nUh yeah I mean it's it's received international acclaim not only national claim but international claim a kitten Kelso joined us down in Atlanta last December to uh get ESPN award and uh you know that was really great in fact came won't be at the game next a\nNext time we're at home I guess that's next week or western news coverage so he'll be he'll be here for that ball game he and his family and uh yeah it's just it's it's just you know it's it's a great thing you know in the best part about it again it's organic I'm Christy aren't having that idea and it grown into something that everybody can\nFeel really good about and that's a good knows no bounds\nSo uh we're thinking about ... let's talk to Tom in Des Moines Tommy is a bit on old Hi Tommy\nHow can I call a core family cannot get three right\nWhy gay for pro I'm well thank God how badly at and say well I didn't go well or is it\nWhere you get out you know\nThat's that's a good thought I'd never thought of like a buzzer or something maybe a buzz buzz in because I'm you know the you know the replay officials and we'll talk about that but the replay guys can a bus down and they do but I was down to the referee that sets up while he gets up to and there\nWere told they review basically every play at least sort of thing it's revealed will um so yeah that's that's an interesting concept that'd be different than throwing the flag in the NFL you got to throw the flag the challenger the ruined heavy but by because there is a little bit challenging when the when the ball is down inside the town\nOf ... the officials are typically pretty good about keeping an eye out for you and um you know it's just one of those deals but that's a unique autonomy thanks for the call Tommy let's go to Kevin before we take a break here yeah Kevin good evening\nA yeah a long long long time listener first time caller a really fun to watch you guys this year I'm just really fun to watch you over the years have two quick questions for you and I hope they haven't been covered because I've been out trick or treating with my kids the first one is for November ... coming up I Know it's a very important month\nCan you read what back on what you might consider your best November and why was it your best November and the other question is when it comes to trick or treat can be\nA ... cat guy or your butter finger guy or your Snickers guy what kind of guy area I'll hang up and let some banks\nOr you know I mean cats are pretty good um baby rooster are pretty good that's money right there but\nI you know Snickers I mean it's it's knickers or nothing really I mean there's knickers in the house I I have a hard time ha ha ha ha you know\nAnd then married gets a little wants to so you know like ... your ... like a piece of gum or
