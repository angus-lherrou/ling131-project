Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know I'm I'm On I'm promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else's devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's\nNot only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat\nTelling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to\nThink Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about\nThe American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the USCC a they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days now you'll get all the official rules when you go to defend family doctor\nFred Trump showing up to collect rent with these twenty six year old son Donald Trump in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carl want a family cannot pay the rent\nThe father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker ... son or looking at them saying okay no problem are very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job\nWell and behold a sixty short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media but people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president that after the\nThe answer is yes he learned it at the riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent from collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success many ways the added he family [noise] is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their ... part of America the artist that broke up America\nYou know the the generations the built this country that none of them is Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we'll look forward to it my friend and all the best on your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading\nI appreciate it God Bless them it\nThanks my front with

that was put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experience is pretty unbelievable here also watching and Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue we have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back come\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the mess lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake you know that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America um\nShe had no problem with Americans joining the Palo bond\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for reaching off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks of some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do a bike too uh but uh I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christians send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nAnd Sean well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and their extremism and so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan\nA hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan weren't hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the ... the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as they ... the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nWithin a few minutes the WMDs studios called complain doorman dangling So Richard unhook likes Jack Benny microphone\nAnd gave him one more suitable for play by play football meanwhile on the field with two teams Iowa in Penn State we're having that wild off ... show I spoke about scoring a lemon

had five eighty seven at that time the six highest total in Iowa football history\nQuarterback truck long through for three hundred and forty five yards for the than Iowa single game record\nAnd I will won the game at Penn State that September Nineteen eighty three day forty two to thirty for the greatest to team often so football game I'd never broadcast with the forty two points the most points ever scored up to that time against Penn State on his home field\nAs my ground and I left the booth that day after finishing up the broadcast we shook hands with our engineer Richard you ain't

people the night of November six that single speed was my first choice she said But Dave more in the owner refused\nHe says as our core beliefs rest a bit left of what we feel will be appropriate for such an event we feel it would be best to guide you in a different direction Morgan wrote in an email to salt so here's you know this debate is here again\nCan we refuse certain people if we don't agree with him but don't if we know here's the thing there are certain\nIdeologies and opinions but I just completely disagree with and I don't want to associate at all [noise] so\nI mean here's the thing I think\nDave Morgan\nOh we're just I just noticed in this Des Moines register article they hum misspelled his name is more in any way I completely think he should be able to do this I think you should have the right as a private business owner to do whatever the heck you want to do with your own private\nBusiness I still agree with this but we should also have the right to not go there which we do\nRight\nI guess the thing maybe single speed should just take up utilities because then you know no one can do no one can say or have an opinion just have to do it so I I totally think they should have the ability to do this thing I just you know we and we should have the ability to not go in and not them\nNot support him you know goes back to the wedding cake the gay wedding cake right this is where this whole national debate just exploded someone did not want to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because he said it did disagreed with his religious beliefs and certain people Hattie his he said about that you can't do that well I'm curious if those same people\nMostly on the left are okay with this behavior I'm going to tell you right now\nThey probably are but I'm I'm all in favor of people making choices and decisions out of their own personal feelings do you want to have a stupid business practices go\nAnd\nSupposed to be free here right and we're supposed to have the freedom to do stupid things\nAnd you and I have the freedom to not go there but here's the question we don't want to\nLive in a society where a black person for example can't do anything or do anywhere because they're discriminated against so where's that line five one five to eight for ten forty we might have time for one quick call but where is that line\nThe law ensures access to public stuff just 'cause that's my really quick synopsis but if it's a private business\n\nCan you let's say can you discriminate against whoever you want where is that safe line I don't want to discriminate I don't want to discriminate for people uh in my business\nBut I think business owners should have the right to because right now you you think about this we think OK well there are certain levels of discrimination those are defined and most people agree with those but what about the day that you don't agree with those what about the day that you have to accept\nCertain people that are extremely dangerous to you or that or you've completely fundamentally disagree with in the future what happens then what happens when the acceptable discrimination applies against you what happened when it works against you\nThat's what my question is it seems OK right now but what happens in the future it's like a slippery slope kind of thing right\nWhat happens when you scale this methodology up\n\nI think individuals should have complete freedom over their own property because it saves you and me from government overreach now does that mean some individuals are going to do things with their own property that's really evil and disgusting and idiotic of course it does\nBut I think they should have the ability to do that and that's\nWhy I think\nDave Morgan should be able to do this he should not get any legal recourse on this\nI also think if you're a Republican and you don't like it you should exercise your ability to not go there\nCan't we hold both of those I think we can I think we

Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo with the pointed message when the thousands of people caravan into the southern us border\nMight be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what a repeat the care of and will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nNo I I'm I'm being very serious about this becoming a sudden money\nProbably the first thing to just take a deep breath be very grateful for your situation you can do a lot of powerful things with money I'm not just for yourself but for other people I'm Doug you were talking about setting up some foundations and and doing things for the greater good\nFamily friends and uh yeah I Do I Know there's one thing that struck right away so I Would argue don't assigned the friend list or we Oh absolutely high up there yeah I was serious I Would take here all my inner circle you'd be checked were the inner circle you while it's great\nI was at to convenience stores today I yeah I must get thirsty are hungry all the time the first one the the guy behind me a he said that uh\nWould you take the lump sum or would you take the the lifetime payout a good question actually said ah I Would have to take lumps he said to me that he would have to take a lifetime payout because if he if he received a lump sum and uh that would be bad news and I I that's all I heard from ... what would you do if you if you did\nCome and do a large chunk of money like talking like a couple of hundred million I mean would you take the lump sum or take it over Twenty years wherever they do for these annuity payments\nWell based on what happened to the lottery winners in Illinois I think you almost have to take the lump sum because uh oh yeah the lottery couldn't yeah that's right a lottery cannot afford to make their payments or any more on those lifetime it's almost the same\nQuestion we get guys about pensions do you take your pension as a lump sum or do you take it as a monthly check mhm I'm In with all the pension insolvency is out there a lot of people are saying I don't care what the tax situation is I don't care what the math says I'm taking my money right now kind of hard to do it too hard to disagree with that money in the hand is you know\nThat much more important yeah the numbers say that a with a one point six billion dollar jackpot that the lump sum option one time pay out after taxes is six hundred and forty four million dollars\nAnd we'd be in the top five your friends are top point yeah yeah it's not ...\nWell no there'd be enough to go around I mean you don't tell me that well dog that's a you know I see eye to eye didn't say I'd like you know every you didn't say that I Would like to make your bed for you in Partridge Amazon you I said that I Would like make it comfortable but\nOf the good do oh yeah I mean seriously if you took that money and just in and just put it in a conservative portfolio and never touched the principle that gets me when I hear these lottery winners going broke or these NFL football players that have gone through fifty sixty Seventy million dollars [noise]\nYou sit down and think about it just take your calculator out and take ten million dollars and take five percent per year take twenty million or thirty and you're that that's a lot of em income coming in you could never touched the principal do some really great things with that money\nYou have the I figured out the share because we're ... we're set ups as we've ... we all review by share my ears would be worth Ninety seven million five hundred and Seventy six thousand dollars\nHow many more fedora is would you buy with with with those winnings by a couple more idle Morial by somebody to brush them off [laughter] that's where I put them on a brush them off\nWhen it came off so I was going back to the coming into sudden wealth around because I've got to say that's a legitimate conversation we have um\nFirst thing is take a deep breath be grateful for what you have and then I Would uh depending on the side of the amount of money either a reconvene with your existing tax preparer exist existing lawyer or your existing wealth manager\nAnd sit down and set up a plant say okay here's the media things you want to do we want to pay off our debt that's kind of a no brainer anybody coming into sudden money ... all the credit cards pay off the house passed the cars\nAnd then we don't want to go in any more debt for a while because the worst thing to do is go out and start building that nice big house you wanted to get the new car get all these things immediately without having a plan you can still do these things to do it in the context of a financial plan so\nI'm I'm sure every buddy out there listening knows of somebody that came into sudden money and then within a short amount of time you're like where did it all go\nAnd it's just gone ... and that happens far more frequently than people realize so a large percentage of lottery winners or broke soon after the you know a couple of years or two or three years after they got their body\nYeah and that's the whole point of making sure that you have somebody that you can trust somebody who is by the tea exactly because it's like a lot of these ... and other professional athletes they'll do this\nAnd what they'll do is they'll grab a hold of people that don't have a ... necessarily a fiduciary responsibility ... they're friends of them the right ... yeah but you hire somebody who this is their job to professional day\nThat is what their fiduciary responsibility is\nAt an ... and they think they have to do everything right now you can set and say well in ... in in a year we're going to do this and next year we're going to do this and um but no I Wish everyone whichever one lock and have some fun doing this you know it's kind of exciting by exactly um\nWhy don't we get to the uh the stories that are the the folks want us to talk about race instead of ice hijacked or right off the beginning with the ah the lottery well\nWe have a question we want to start counting throwing out there that is timely not in regards to the mega millions but with the volatility we're having um I think anyone that's been following the markets know that\nUh we've had pretty much just a straight run up for the last decade and we occasionally we've had these little little hiccups and we're kind of in one right now um and Daryl I didn't see where he's from\nAsked us with the recent volatility in the market is there anything to be concerned about or any changes we should be making to our investment strategy so Jonas\nDaryl in your office he asked you this question how do you answer\nThat I Would say yes definitely uh you know we need to ah\nAdjust barrels portfolio to whatever stage in life he is right now because we don't know we don't know an accumulation of distribution exactly and uh\nHe was in it in a different stage in life nine years ago when the market started to take off well nine years later Daryl you could be closer to retirement\nWe don't know what your stage is in life I liked our company president Jeff\nAlways has said the last Twenty years that I've been working with them that uh is never met anybody that's regretted taking gains or profit off the table and you you\nYou you hate to use the casino analogy but if you're if you've seen your four O. one K. up four one K. go up by Nineteen percent for the last two or three years if you can just picture maybe and you're getting closer to retirement\nIt seems to me it's a pretty good idea to take some of the house money off the table and put it somewhere different it's always been a good strategy or not seeing a lot of new people do that because uh you know I think that people just have status quo bias it's just\nIt's just that they don't want to make any changes it's been working fine no big deal I'm well if that's the case you better get used to some more volatility than than we've had and the the ...\nOr not read recommending people to trade their their investment portfolios but if you think of your money and we go back to this is our ten year during the financial our we talk a lot about the buckets and I think I think when you're looking at your investments\nTo really understand whether or not you should make changes I guess goes back to what bucket you're in rock at one is your liquid seat cash bucket you're you're not the market volatility has no bearing on your bucket one that's just money you're keeping in there to pay for that serve the furnace that breaks the new tires et cetera whereas I found out braces for my freshman in high school so\nGot that and great news today ... yeah congratulations\nYeah um and clarify you don't want to sell one of your investments to to pay for the braces right or you want\nTo have that bucket bucket choose your income bucket and those are those are investments that typically pay income dividends interest and capital gains and those are going to be a little less volatile what this market flux flux we're having lately so you have your bucket three which is about sixty percent of your overall portfolio is in your growth bucket\nThat's the one that's going up and down every day with the markets but that's long term money\nSo we're looking at long term money with short term vision\nAnd that is the disconnect that most investors have out there ... is that they're looking at short term volatility in the market and they're applying it to their long term investments so we have to go back to people in Darryl ask a very fair question but he's it basically asking that in context of all of his money\nWell we're not talking about all this money there's there's three separate bucket short term mid term and long term and really the market volatility is affecting the one bucket that it can afford to effect and that's your long term money so I Would I Would say probably and Darryl situation we we needed a little more about um Jonas I agree\nWith ya but nine times out of ten [noise]\nWe're not recommending people will do anything [noise] in a reactionary physician that's what that's what you do right now you're not being proactive you if you make changes right now you're reacting to the market pills are discussions you have to have with your visor before the market does what it's doing now and that more people don't do that and that's part of your financial planning process right Louise\nYeah I mean it's it's not a it's a marathon not a sprint night treated as such so yes there you
