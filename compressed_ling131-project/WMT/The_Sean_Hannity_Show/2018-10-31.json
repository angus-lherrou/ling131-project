have you\nTaught your child how to apologize I'm Mark Merrill with today's family minute as your child grows up they'll develop many relationships and those relationships they're bound to make mistakes that's why it's so important to teach your child what a true apologies looks like\nSo here's some ways to do so first teach them that a lack of intent doesn't excuse them from apologizing whether your child's actions were purposeful or accidental sure they know to apologize no matter what\nA lot of those Trump voters who didn't always voted mid term election uh because I think they realize that this is an important race for the future of Florida that's good news for a\nWhile but you got you running for Rick Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida\nAnd I love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he\nPaid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in so happy and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby it's buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence\nAndrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York junk get paid for a for a night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so interested in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and the anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may uh Gillum blamed Israelis do they just use those attacks as a pre tax it'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is really ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleep in protest that the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case\nAnd I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are in the law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number when he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really up in the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty\nPercent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax

congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat\nOr Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted as tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of the hot sauce in New York City because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nA that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nIn order your home that I think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people to use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd that puts you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut uh yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people get up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they

you have insurance\nThat you would like Ben you\nWill be able to keep that insurance if you like your doctor or health care plan you can keep it if you like your health care plan you can he keep your health care plan\nSo if you like your plan you can keep your plan\nTo play\nIf you like your current insurance you will keep your current insurance if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you like your plan you can keep your plan if you're happy with what you got nobody is changing\nAnd if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and it'd be like if you want to pay less you can pay less\nThe truth and the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors\nLost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of belied the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating as we now head into the final week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about\nNow we had earlier in the program had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's not been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat in North Dakota\nChristian send them other Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California on top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I'm going to tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums that are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lie to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points\nAll across the country they say well where we're going to where we support health care of preexisting conditions well the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions and they're trying to basically go with the narrow\nLie that Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff\nOf course they're racist or sexist massage sticking Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump so even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda ally in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress and the Senate as we move forward and there\nAre a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants to universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors\nMhm that Congress thinking has not he's not ignored the average American family you know he's out there and he actually he just spoke on the issue\nYou know but what does the media do the liberal media nobody reported on it they just swept it right under the rug style we do have\nA great divide 'em and I just don't understand why the media has chosen to just pretty much block it out and I'll give you an example of that\nUh two thousand sixteen in Phoenix, Arizona the angel families were invited to speak at the Trump rally\nAnd we came out and could not believe our eyes you have a mother who is talking about ... what ... talking about a young child who was at the beach and apparently these illegal aliens want at the beach to themselves\nAnd they felt that they attacked this group of kids who lived at the beach\nThey took eight paint roller and clenched it from one ear to the other and you have a mother who is talking about this now with the media did they try their cameras off\nThe coast doesn't fit the logic and Jimmy ... general Shaw you know do you know ...\nI have not met him but I Know that is a troop\nEight oh he's an amazing guy told me on this show or the officers some jazz was murdered or buying

should guarded no\nBecause we project [noise] and\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel\nAnd yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the Senate GOP shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop say mean things about me I'll stop and signing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated what Trump\nIs doing is stoking inciting\nFor the purposes of political power the worst amongst us\nTo take action in his name anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these are vanish any insight match is dishonest as they are blind\nI don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the president of the United states for the race\nWas manage them I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in just a matter of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally\nJust the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look it would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and\nAnd shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to it he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is in is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the of the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part\nAnd what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about what they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist saving do comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for that finally admitting that your own life nationalist and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are linking George Soros and these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan Fox News talking about small pox and leprosy coming up it is [noise] I I'm Sorry I I won't say specifically white regime this is out of them go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twenty century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy [laughter] that's what it is in lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they're hungry gypsies and Jews\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ... biggest terror\nThreat in the\nIs white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\n[noise] there was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no\nWhite guy band so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail attacks against and migrant continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to say you think that the same language that they not murder at the synagogue used in terms of invaders and\nInvasion these tragedies work at cross purposes narrative ... so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified hang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this joy is very hard\nNot even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also at times got along with them as as cars out there who not only that that just like oh I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in\nNew York character he's not a Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate and as far as I'm ... [noise] and I don't mean that in an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they are ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me\nOne week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this I Do the fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN or white flash

Jordan McNair who ah died of heat stroke or following a workout a back earlier in the summer\nOf that whole story is a tragedy uh it's been well documented a yesterday the Maryland border regions came out with their findings\nOf two separate studies one independent one ah internally and both suggested that a DJ dirt can be retained as the head coach and show the regions show went with that as did the politic record the president the school\nAnd a a stunned college football world I think it's safe to say was digesting ... twenty four hours certainly last night in the morning at all the talk shows or when a lo and behold\nA it was announced just shortly so that he will not be retained his head coach that he will be a relief from his duties as the head football coach at the University of Maryland you had to figure when the uh the governor of the state of Maryland\nA chimed in ah last night in the morning that he couldn't believe the decision rendered by the border regions and and then others started to dial it as well but probably this is not a huge surprise uh uh the program or some players walked out of the first team meeting the\nCoach jerk and had it was just going to be a a near impossible situation for him to get this program back under rain\nAnd move on as if nothing had happened and and obviously a a cooler heads prevail they discussed it throughout the day and coach
