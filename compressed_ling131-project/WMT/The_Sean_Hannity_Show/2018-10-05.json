Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody could corroborate her story number one\nNumber to our own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that this ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yell classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapist of teenage girls so give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not to do I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute but everybody's talking hunted with a full and\nFair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating and whatnot says to the I think now and the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not\nSure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so could you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not saying that I don't expect that you would expect and I did\nBut I didn't know what you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite occur operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nSo the charges are college or in that scene on at the

on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know it's not talking point what hang on a second I Want you interview\nLooking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event than the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo see what else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you now you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bounds of the ...\nIf there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't even know the house but she mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she said one\nWitness or didn't happen and so my question is what the FBI\nDo if they don't know the location that can't be looking
