on assignment come way show\nOn now I'm living the dream baby every day you know that\nOkay I appreciate your what he's saying but we had a round all white sand is never ever go down as what I hear\nAll right when he can hey so let's give them a chance to answer okay\nYeah so on the rates going down so we worked hard every single day to get more efficient at the service we provide and our goal is to continue to make our rates low and stable ended extent we can bring those down we will for example the above energy bill that was discussed yesterday had an energy efficiency component of it which we reduced roughly in half\nAnd so that lowers your bill\nSo your your bills have gone down very recently or will go down very recently once if we get energy efficiency approved\nOr because I always told his board based on the law that was passed him and and you will see that flow through your bill so there are ways to get your costs lower and then we continue to find ways to operate our business more efficiently and keep costs from no driving your rates up\nOK art appreciate that I'll be looking for a bill to go down there and we'll see what that apple\nYeah you're you're both buddy as a side my only financial interest in mid American is the bill they sent me once a month or but I got to say thanks Thanks Greg I'm going to say I came up from Florida I'm trying to remember the name of the company down that um which I count because it was ... years ago and ah and it feels to me like what she put them in Florida oh we\nWe are we're ... lowest in the country okay I'm rates were about thirty three percent lower than the national average I'm fifty one percent of the energy consumed lashar temperament over resources are going to a hundred percent I mean we are doing very progressive things in terms of how we supply energy to our customers and we're keeping our rates very low very stable very competitive\nRight oh let's go and talk to a janitor I pronounced not ...\nYeah\nHi you're on the on the sun to come we show and you also a with a Mr Right I'm right\nAdam right good to talk to you again\nYeah nice to meet all of them again excellent\nYeah it's actually yeah we've had conversations before but I'm Adam ... them refused to talk to me now so I'm I'm going to call you on the radio Adam\nI'm going to do this\n[laughter] I'm Jana ... with the coalition for

them to tell you\nYeah my question is is you're paying for all these when turbans with the industrial or the with the production tax credit\nAnd I'm a lot of other incentives and things like that well eventually that were knocking these turbans are all going to have to be replaced\nAnd I'm Wondering about that costs down the line up in Ontario I'm crisis got so high that they kicked off the liberal party that brought in the green aren't the act and I'm just wondering how you're going to avoid\n... well let's let's all skin that very question how you're going to replace these things when the time comes at the tax credits\nGo now to the idea is to keep operating for a forty fifty sixty years primary process not re power bunch of when turbans continue people functional operational and we work with the county's they require us to set aside the commissioning funds to guarantee that we can find those things and so we have those things set up and\nI were to have no problem at all in the future if it comes to that point your mood those turbans to make sure we know take care of that and without raising or customers rates that's all been baked in to the economics of the projects that gentleman I hear your little all hung on every\nOne everyone gets to go and that will give you a question do you go out and start a ... so you're taking the time thank you\nUh I'd made it very clear repeatedly without 'em in the studio I'm not fond of wind energy because it's not doable without that tax credit or ... and I do not believe we should be a part of something else I Believe it stifles um ingenuity in the wind energy a business I'm not against wind energy I'm just against\nUs paying for it but but I Would also made the point that every single time we've had this conversation I have said if I had a Adams job or a previous us this job I sent it to him as well I Would do exactly the same thing he's responsible to shareholders and his customers are Gregory you're on the sun ...\nHow

what makes sense he's responsible to his show there's he's responsible to his customers\nAnd as far as ah throwing my colleague under the bus I Do not believe for a second I did that I have repeatedly

M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nReport suspicious behavior ... Fox News the highest priority for the FBI would director Christopher Wray is saying about the series of homemade bombs that was the high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama and congresswoman Maxine Waters of California\nI had been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse\nIf these mobs don't stop what they're doing and the mobs in the case is always talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some device had been putting his mailbox and I listen to what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nWhy they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near a George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that would love to\nShow to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop this crap\nHas got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal and these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant\nWe have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nId they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to\nBangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say Hi and Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he's a racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and\nIn the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific policies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are\nDying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know\nLeading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe\nBomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus yet in their face holder tech them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like my thoughts and\nPrayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nBut there was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back to three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull least nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that's the least the shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say\nSay I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite I don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting lead partisan\nTo lay eggs something more\nThan ... days we would like love\nMoney to visit your store my now dot com usa\nPossible sequel housing Linder\nGetting national
