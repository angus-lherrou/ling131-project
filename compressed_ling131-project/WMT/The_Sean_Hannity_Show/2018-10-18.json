I was a program\nThat a terrific coach is really good players\nBut you you want to see if proven every week of September he wants to tend to get better as just heard a progress is and what October November get here for that that that aid game seven game stretch drive the guys are here that all cylinders that you know to buy amateur eye it looks like that's happening I think that's\nHer and um you know are given illustration that guy like Corker has he's not going to improve dramatically a cause he's played so much football forest but you know we have a lot more guys that aren't like that more guys that are\nAre playing in their first second years and a good thing about being young and experiences you really have a chance to have more dramatic change an improvement [noise]\nAh but it but it all sorts goes back to practice again how you approach practice or you know you're really focus on the things that you need to be doing and everybody's got an individual less so the the guys will do that concentrate on that and really work on it when they're out there in the ... [noise]\nAnd then go studying you know that that's a that's our guys improve so we talked about that all the time and um you know we got got better and guys like Parker [noise]\nBucky can render but we are a lot of other guys that really you know Ross Reynolds is a senior at the center that has a really a starter game until this year and then he played in a bunch last year but not a\nFull season so this is a learning process for him and um you know so we get everybody whether those gathered Ross or [noise]\nUm you know a younger guy and a red shirt crushed run or a guy like Trojan horses in his second year on campus\nYou know that that's out themes improving but it starts with all their thinking on how they work\nYou measure that it's not a big senior class for Thirteen fourteen guys are\nClearly they're doing their job leading these younger guys bringing up a law\nReally are and um you know and [noise]\nA TV screen or his me and my binoculars a Polack watches the play and then he turns to the TV monitor which is as good as\nA as he likes the delayed because it's like a slow motion replay for him he he he commented on what he sees that he's always right as you know and then he looked at the replay a and that adds another little uh uh salt pepper spice to it ah that's why a total lack of so good I mean he wouldn't ...

Kelly is uh [noise]\nIt just a painting the when the forecast Saturday I've heard more talk today about the wind that that's expected a game time are you practicing outside to get accustomed to that expected when the conditions\nThat we took a drag says that any way so that that's another big issue and it's been breezy the last two days it's been chilling I'll say that you know we're a third whatever time eight eight thirty [noise] um [noise] so it's been chilly but [noise] uh it's been windy but not not to the degree they're\nAbout and that yes there is a first I'd heard of that good news it's it's just the ones they announced that things have changed for sure that that's part of playing football and uh you know especially in the Midwest and or or the northeast or certain parts of our country we are going to deal with when during the cold weather so we're like the ... [noise]\nUh and it is I think I still believe it's the biggest factor in any outdoor sports uh whether it's golf not that annoying about golf the Gulf football baseball\nThe tractor and so it's good to be conditioned to\nYou and your justice of the fly a native sure what kind of issues with the Maryland office presented his is similar to Georgia Tech\nWhen we play them on the Orange Bowl um we were talking before you got here about uh [noise] the last two weeks you face pass happy officer some out of necessity some that's what they do a this was a totally different game plan is\nVery different and I used the Georgia Tech comparison the other thing I guess yesterday uh seems like three weeks ago [noise] but uh anyway uh just um [noise]\nIt's it's not going to look like that to to our fans but to what it's going to look good comparison there is that you really have to know your responsibility and when you play an option to you Mike like Georgia Tech is if you don't have a guy covering every base and exactly and the red spots full may hit thirty plays on your [noise]\nSo the comparison is with a Maryland in my mind at least these guys do a lot of shifting a lot of emotion and the jets we package where a lot of guys you know raise some through there and obviously that affects the what's going on the constantly so first and foremost it starts out with guys recognizing the formations\nAnd then there's a lot of communication has to go on after a call gets made because they're going to be moving around and doing stuff for the words shifting motion and all that stuff requires communication so you gotta love and does it have to get the same\nUh same adjustment in signal and then most importantly they got a point when the ball gets that but it all happens really fast and it's very tough to to stimulate and practice cause you know we we don't do that all that often for SARS go to him to do it uh it's a real challenge\nThe nice thing about Georgia Tech is that we have time to train or a scout teams or or ... got a good look at it [noise]\nAh it's tough for us to duplicate in breakfast what we're going through Saturday So\nThat sort of the mental work really comes on these guys have to really do a good job in the ... and you know the most important one can do what you see on a lot of times because of all this stuff you used to be getting a position above back will break through the line of scrimmage and you know if you don't have good angle Superbowl\nAll of a sudden we're should be arguing or tenure arguing ends up in the in the end zone and um [noise]\nYou know just the atmosphere so\nAh I Can't remember pointed to him and his somebody big place you know what I think um [noise]\nBecause it's like it's like sixty Dr seuss ... sixteen they've at sixteen drives over sixty yards and all but two of those they've had at least one if not too explosive type poison it so [noise]\nYou know you just you see those you know twenty yards gained sixty five you're arguing and it's just really you don't see that a lot and and that that kills your defensively if you're not you know you got to make them more\nDue to guard your yard as they say they have a lot of us direction too is you know\nThe day the hawks played Wisconsin Minnesota played out there during the day I was able to see a lot of that game of the press box and [noise]\nThey get through the first line of defense or whether they hit the big play their God it overcome\nIt exactly or for long touchdowns in that game than they had a ... system for good measure hurts so that the Pentagon made a big play too so it's a\n... you know and they are um you know it's just it's it's a unique preparation\nA coach Canada the who's now the acting head coach I remember a couple of years ago there were getting ready for Penn State and watching the he was a pit at the time the same thing they're they're moving around you know it was like whoa these guys are doing a lot of different stuff that they were wearing Penn State up at the two things like three years ago maybe ... to\nYou know so they think he's got a good package he's coached in northern Illinois Wisconsin and you know you know the big town in the early ... very restrictive person\nBut tell you what he was obviously ... everything they've gone through over there just mentally\nWith the uh Jordan McNair a tragedy\nTo give a lot of credit among those players a lot of credit to so they've done a great job\n[noise] car I coach show will give you a break here for a couple of minutes well let's step out here from our wonderful sponsors rock talked for Carlos so Kelly's with kosher when we return [noise]\n[noise] you're shot\nYou know anything can happen and then he six of those that's just the nature of college football especially in the big ...\nStuck on half of the season or\nThe light backers earlier a I heard your comments yesterday\nLooks like jak Koch a day is not going to be ready to strike but that ... might be\nJak coming along but not ready to play doesn't have the confidence or not quite strong enough yet and Nick on the other hands in good shape you know he said he was\nResponding well last friday we thought looked pretty good and ready to play yet but uh you know came up the price Monday and he has he's at no reservations but he's doing a good job and [noise] good good to get him back in the boat certainly and you know that for the guys have been doing a good job you know I'm a Christian waltz a Welsh jumped in there\nThat the middle linebacker position last Saturday\nA primarily worked at the well positioned fall spring summer all that type of thing and jump right in there did a great job so [noise] uh you know we're seeing a lot of guys do a lot of different things on the team to help the cause yet we're we're still getting the production we're still Blanco he's civil Ian [noise] that's good because this will be a new challenges we\nSure will a body Jones or the way they run the ball a ... could be a real factor this week\nIt will definitely uh [noise] you know you can see 'em out there in the field some so you know he's he's the guy that to some some guy's pretty well on their own spit on a great job on special teams to\nAustin has some nice to say to her on Twitter at very often [noise] coach I leave the country and passing yards a third down I was unaware of that and that do that with that one I best what factors have gone into that it has your play calling\nApproach on third downs changed this year [noise] well it's nice when you come up thirty two and three versus\nFederal is elderly that always helps the uh the situations are the distance the situation certainly is a big factor in [noise] I'll go back to what we talked about the way I just think in general are often is right now we go to a lot of lot of guys that have more experience than we had a year ago and uh you know\nThe quarterback gets a lot of credit or blame for you know what is happening or what is happening in certain there's all sorts of the quarterback but but every other piece of the puzzles really important and\nYou know you got to have a a pithy or senior playing quarterback and there's nobody throw two that makes it a little bit of a challenge and [noise] ah you know if he's not being protected so [noise] I just think we're more cohesive experience football in the way we're going our Arthur dumb percentages of conversions and then for Duncan versions are reflecting that\nIndeed almost fifty percent forty four Ninety a third down that's off the off the church uh the hawks were eight of twelve our third down last week it at Indiana [noise] uh Larry wants to know coaches Ernie difficulty going from the two thirty or seven o'clock kick total eleven AM kick you've got to the road\nYeah we are talking about that a lot of the players and then it\nIt ... we a practice in in pre season in August that the various times just for that that same reason so will\nYou know how to seven o'clock practice where they got to hang around during the day and we'll have to almost as well\nIt'd be like reporting games so this year we've kinda gone up and down the scale we um nothing start out at two thirty then we went to a four o'clock then once I got six thirty or something like that than a seven forty when we started coming back down the ladder and young and I think we had a a three thirty or whatever it was and then a\nThird to a matter of Missouri\nLast week I Know was noon a you know east eastern time which obviously is eleven o'clock central time so that we're right back to eleven would choose to be the standard time [noise] but uh yeah I just told you know we told him every Monday what the kickoff times going to be on your infamy wants me as an excuse for that performance the way right now I mean that's just that's ridiculous but\nThat is college football is a good question goes to the pro football's the same way you know that the networks tell you when you're going to watch as you'd like to say [noise]\nYou get twelve Saturday gotta get twelve game show and hopefully get a thirteenth doesn't matter what time before I go out

chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody can find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupted

Yes sir Yes sir before they beat the put a beat down on the titans so yeah we have now I'm able to do in during any more revenue travel ... prior to our titans [laughter] unbelievable unbelievable what really motivated them\n... we had a good time Dave and ah I didn't pray for them to beat us but er hey it was an amazing game is [laughter] I I but I Love the diet and but I Love the ravens too so hey the best one way or the flu\nWell that day the best football team playing that but yet I don't think that our heightens guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was but ah so you you've done that travels several times you do some other NFL work as well so some of the other teams of cold and you and ... both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm\n... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it\nWhat do I do ... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelmed money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents know how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um rookies out there that I've had the opportunity to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they're going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I could say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do that and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are tech to me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about that you know it's just real cool to see these young players want to be good on a field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river passers we're with yesterday that you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area\nAnd so if you got a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there\nAnd the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a kid but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body and MIT error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who she is a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids and they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nI'm a I've got a a friend of mine you probably know who he is as well or he used to a seven and a uniform of this great nation\nHis name is Rob Smith I hate to as black key to a ... the president and he too is speaking out about it and as he says on his own he's owing a twist of fate ah they've caught him Kuhn\nA disgusting it really is awful where we we find ourselves sheriff\nIt's reprehensible and it is disgusting or those terms of all been applied to me you know I've got about this a ... for a long time you know inability to the beach in the middle of this political environment fighting as a true hard core conservative and I've been subject to the same thing so Kanye West I say\nA welcome to the party this is the way you're going to get treated by the side\nNo respect whatsoever racist some of this stuff\nI had a guy sent me an email\nAnd he said congratulations on being named Trump's house and then the N. word okay this is an eight I get\nI get a threat but again you know I I realize that that's the target I put on my back I think it's worth it because we're talking about freedom and liberty in the United states of America\nOr the left is despicable there really are the treatment that uh they give someone whose views differ from there\nYou know what I think for myself I'm a free thinker you don't have to agree with me I don't mean you are I'm Talking about paying laughter agree with me well let's talk let's have a discussion bringing the euro ... research where do you mean your day to bring the fact that I'm a show that what what I say\nDoesn't carry any water well they don't have it okay I've gone across the country defending the American law enforcement officer\nAnd I presented the data that they don't use that excessive amount of force against young black males where you're coming up with that well they don't have an answer because the data doesn't exist so this is what we're up against we know the enemy I Know the enemy I Know what they're like I Know what the tactics are I've developed effective counter tactics to deal with the clown\nAnd that's why they hate me more than anything else\nThey're trying to destroy me they're trying to weaken my resolve it not working and it's interesting them off\nAmerica's sheriff David clock thank you so much for joining us we really do appreciate it so have you back\nIt's my pleasure God Bless you\nGod Bless you

that\nWinning field goal against Michigan hate seven seven to nine oh over four five oh the beginning of the world series next week brings to mind a story one that I remember best it was the only perfect game that was pitched in a World Series\nIt was pitch by Don Larsen of the New York Yankees in the Nineteen fifty six series against then Brooklyn Dodgers\nA perfect game if you don't know is the picture retiring all the opposing batters without a banner reaching first base [noise] the reason I remember that World Series perfect game so well it is and I kept score that game\nAnother reason I remembered so well is that I kept that scorecard for years and have now is placed it and can't find it high search for it any number of times when my collected stuff and then again this week I Know I saved it because I saw it some years ago\nIt's distinctive because I kept it on an eight by eleven piece of cardboard that I drawn up as a scorecard before sitting down to watch that World Series game on TV [noise]\nIt was unusual for me to keep score of a TV game but I usually always keep score when I attended a major league baseball game in person\nWhen I went to cubs or White Sox games with my son Jack who lived in Chicago for many years he knows well buying the scorecard was the first thing we did after going through the gate\nAnd he also knows that he got stuck keeping it when I went to the concession stand to get my Chicago dog\nAnd uncle taught me to keep score out of town team game when I was about twelve years old\n[noise] some of you may not know what keeping score at a baseball game means it doesn't mean just keeping the runs and who scores and who's ahead it means keeping track of what every better does every time up in every inning the score sheet is sort of a grid\nThere are nine small squares representing a baseball diamond behind each batters name and when he batch you put in that square what the batter does during each at bat\nThere are numbers and symbols that go with the system so that you keep on a batter does\nIn an abbreviated form each player is numbered other than his uniform number with the pitcher being number one the catcher too the first baseman three and so on around the infield an outfield with the right fielder number nine\nIf a battered grounds out shortstop the first few put six dash three in his box because the shortstop is six and the first baseman his three if the batter flies out to the left field or you put F dash seven F for fly and seven as the last ... number\nIf a batter gets on base you draw lines on the little baseball diamond behind is named to move them around the bases\nAnd you put a single hash for one base hit and to hash is for a to base it and so on he is for air W for walking Kay is first strike out as in K own in boxing and don't ask me where\nThat one came from some here\nDoes it go I took my twelve year old grandson Jay to Cedar Rapids colonels game and taught him to keep score had to get another generation going on this you know and he got to so low on the score card when I went to get that brought worst\nI'd love to show Jay that scorecard I kept on Don Larsen perfect game and that Nineteen fifty six World Series but you know how it goes you'll get to see it when it turns up some day when I'm not looking for\n[noise] business news you can back on the\nMIT [laughter]

I don't want to talk about it\nJust don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm gonna keep saying in any way so their gender is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state\nThey want ... why do they want open borders to they calculated that's going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven\nBy a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by Medicare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBecause after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American
