he got her Kirk or wanted to know ah I I Do I Do kidding oh keep used a script [noise]\nBecause the first fourteen Fifteen place about brand does he do the same thing yeah I I think\nIt's really kind of become a trend we're we're most coaches do that not all that most do or are they may um [noise] uh you know list or ten or twelve plays that they want to work into the conversation and really the two are almost the same because uh even when you strip plays out if you get into a certain situation you get off the script go to your [noise]\nYour menu if you will as like you know what are we are on thirty one or whatever first time we get in a situation we always have those\nIn a separate category but I I think most the coordinators are play cars have kind of gotten in that mode and Brian's on the same thing and uh you know they put a lot of button time into that that that's a there are certain things you're trying to look for typically a you know show multiple formations maybe some motions or shifts those types of things and\nYou know you're trying to trying to get your guys going but you're also trying to get a feel for how the opponents gonna play you on that given day and uh it's amazing how\nA lot of times what you see ... film or you get a different a different recipe when you when you show up for the games so it's always it's always interesting to see how things are [noise] you know in an atlas both ways you know how we're going to play somebody or vice versa and\nThere's a lot of little little intricacies that are going on in the course of the game on both sides of the ball but you're not draw these plays out of a jar is okay we're going to run this sweep hopefully not yeah we were ... a full full confession on that but\nBut it all based on tendencies it is I mean he he you know every team took who has a personality and sometimes the personality as you are going to get a smattering of\nA and those are those are some preparations to you know the better teams tend to you know they have an identity and the trick is you know okay we know what they're going to do and\nWhat have you but now the trick is to go out and execute against them because they do do it very well and uh so yeah everything's a little bit different there and then as you well know a college football I think one of the beauties of college football is there is a very diverse um way of going about things in terms of your office of tech your defense of attack and\nYou see a lot more diversity in college football I think that way than it did you tell a not not to [noise] you know say there is no diversity there that's not an accurate statement but [noise]\nYou know you you might get a team it's going to Georgia Tech for instance yeah are you won't find that in the NFL or in the ... of his like cutting six hundred Russian yards up against somebody so\nWe we know that nightmare and we saw those homes so it just um you know it's it's you know one week you may be playing a team like that and then the next week it may be\nA Washington state who's going to throw it all over the joint and\nYou know so I think that's one of the things about college football I think that's one of the reasons fans are so intrigued by the whole whole sports\nCoaches you could imagine the speaking of execution the swinging gates sake field goal attempt [noise]\nUh for a touchdown has gotten a lot of play everywhere it has been on her a Twitter page a lot tonight read a coach I Know it's been discussed to death but\nI loved the trick play how much did Brian have to talk\nYou into running that won it iffy up or if or if he had to do the ... and you thought it was about ten to one coaches are against it you are or a coach's favorite you against it but\nI guess are there are a few more agree with you\nYeah no I'm just trying to play up to the stereotype of being a curmudgeon you know the next everything a killer good idea conservatives are you are as a no it's it's it's interesting I think um to that point [noise]\nUm [noise] you know really\nAnd and it really kind of began after the fourteenth season I think you know obviously we change our practice schedules we ah had long conversations about [noise] you know being a little bit more aggressive on fourth down those kinds of things so [noise] I I think our mindset change a little bit program was and um [noise] you know it continues to be that way but [noise]\nTo to the point of this player any play like that you know we we all kind of talk about the staff during the week and then on Fridays we kinda [noise] um [noise] you know [noise]\nCapsule as our our ideas a little bit and then you know in a case like this it's [noise]\nThey do we think it's the executed and uh it's the first discussion and then secondly what are the situations where it might show up and it just so happens the other day that it was the perfect situation for it or you might go into a game like that with every intention of running that play in that situation doesn't arise so it's it's on the shelf\nOr in some places are only go from a certain hash mark you know that type of thing so he might have the right down to distance figure on the wrong hash or you know ... you know those types of things so there's a lot lot that goes into it but I think the bottom line is our staff communications been really good [noise]\nUm [noise] a bar in that case was responsible for those ideas but you know it might be a temp politic might that might be something they did it North Dakota state that uh you know we throw up on the board and\nIt's worth looking at you know I'll go back to the ... it was something that you know we look the work that practice for a while and\nWhat we had a chance to execute it can execute it that's that's really the bottom line is you can execute it if\nIf ... or Jackson doesn't make a great a cap on it you know throw that out if breaks can't make a great block on the edge you know it's it's good on the board but not very good on the field that teachers pretty gifted it to do it a lot of great things with the football don't don't underestimate teacher doing anything he's he's really a ...\nA ... a super [noise]\nHe he's shifted that thing left hand is is he capable of doing it with both hands a lot yeah yeah right into the dash bass Vince oh\nBut wait a minute so blessed with terrific log staffers for a lot of reasons the clue VR uh it's interesting\nYou know not everything has been perfect for a Nineteen plus years but that is to your point we we have been so good at that positions are on the show and ah going way back Twenty years ago a and in combination of the every one of the guys is walk on\nAnd they're kind of all like self made you guys you know ... it was not a big guy when he showed up here\nYou know you hate force fed himself to get up to two Fifteen or twenty would realize that he was the yeah yeah and he's a little guy when he got here but you know that was part of the deal so he loved to wrestle they they told us has still does they just did that positions are really been [noise] um [noise] you know Casey Crowder\nWe've just had such a good a good run ... amazing\nYeah ad that we were talking earlier about Penn State districts for game of state a lot of long steps up trying to think who are staffer was uh\nWas Cody Cody Cody asked toning down all for the ... who's now or the scoring okay I never thought of that game and that way that's very that's a good trivia good step one rally back that weren't truly are they out there you go Cody asked us\nWell since you're willing\nTo be a little bit more liberal if the the trick plays or play calling Trevor Trevor a Twitter says coach ship could we see sergeant run a wild cat play\nAlso see bad cell wrote a few plays well Peyton Manning cell he speaks of backup quarterback or are they doing just fine right now we paid that's that's good hopefully we can see a play a little bit but\nMinnesota obviously had a gigantic six foot two hundred forty pound tight in running wild cat to the guys are pretty talented guy I don't know if you're one of the wildcat about he is\nHe's only been there for months right now so we'll ... we'll just let him get stolen and his position [noise] um but yeah I'm not opposed to that and this guy's been reading my mind here because\nUm I actually saw a prospect during my by week where\nI was at a game and um [noise]\nYou know so a lot of passes at night the best one was drawn by a this prospect who was not a quarterback so\nI've already I don't mind my recording promises but I told him if he comes here we're going to win ... where they don't cause it here because he can catch it run it in a boy when I was passing through\nYeah I guess a one more before we take a break here are tied to coach a defense or a [noise]\nA pass interference hold up the interference holding their all subjective er there's so much contact\nA receivers a defensive backs or how do you teach it as a better to play the ball or the receiver of normal passed away what's the first what are your first to\nShow you that you know tons of Arizona man too so you know there's a different component there are but\nUh yeah I mean you better understand and appreciate what that man is doing a so you'd better have track of him and uh there's there's a certain time in aspects as far as playing the role\nOf your own coverage that's a little different but uh yeah you you got to know where that's where the receiver isn't that\nA lot of times when you see guys come open a perfect place\nFor a place where you're in the fans go on like does anybody covering that guy it's usually because ah people start picking on that that are just a combination ...\nNot only in the back younger guys up front do the same thing when you start picking up in the background or the chilled excuse me yeah I Know you get caught up in that and what you're responsible for\nWhether it's a receiver you're covering or a guy that you're supposed to be you know to feeding a block on too much there and you\nEnd up by a it's a matter what happens afterwards 'cause you're in a bad position so\nUh that that's the rule having the discipline to stay with your particular key and every player has won every play [noise]\nUm but that is so important that every position and\nIt's easy to get distracted out there are times you know some some very hard but it is you know a lot going on but\nYou really have to be focused and discipline on whatever you're given a key is for for a

behind that we can not even catch up\nFor about two months behind on all bills it's causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just seeing it gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um [noise] let's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing us so much stress on our marriage and kids being behind on your bills should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old you are behind on the lights that's not their problem much your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give them a big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there somebody you don't know what I'm Talking about you been there too and you\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix it\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go and so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier and it costs less\nSo there we go but\nYou make enough to do that check but that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that\nYou make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month\nBefore you do anything else after you ate ... current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap\nBut I'm Talking about water and the lights\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas heat\nOkay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent it doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there was no heat so you've got to put heat in the place okay so you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nI'm On my response was uh when I went off on another show off I Would have goals\nDo it it would be a not only a a an honor it would you see\nI I wore a everybody I think if\nThat the UN building the whole thing would go up in a conflict smoke with stem cells but um I don't I don't know probably a lot of people on the list\nAnd you know what I'm a lot of fun right now as a private citizen\nI'm sure you are I think you I think he'd be great by the way we we need someone who's willing to have the\nUh the backbone of uh of Nikki Haley me that's what we need to know is not afraid to say and you'll you'll that guys are as I'm concerned ah Sebastian Gorka why we fight is the book I a strongly advise you

M.

M. T. V. on and then we would hear the horn out and get on the way home when we get the table sat and they were ready\nThere's nobody on the radio noontime program from the downtown streets of Cedar Rapids continued into the Nineteen sixties renamed from itch man on the street origin over the years\nShepherd was succeeded on it by many alter and then by one to WMDs legendary personalities deem land fear ran for your hosted it the longest\nAnd into its final days with a man on the street program had become land fears well known noon day program voice of Iowa\nLook around you see this even this all began someone's dream this book this land\nSo when people say American things insurance protests and we should go ahead\nBecause we put\nDream\nAmerican family mutual insurance company as I entered operating company six thousand American Parker Madison, Wisconsin\n[noise]\nWe are across the state of Iowa where it is Simon ... by the way if you got a daughter has a little less interested in aviation\nWhile\nUh eighties girls in aviation day a from a woman in aviation in a national are coming up on a Saturday ...\nUh you cannot register on event bright a it is that uh the aviation academy school a which is on the county line mode in Des Moines a all kinds of stuff going on there\nAnd that is um on Saturday So I'd go check it out you have girls\nWho are interested in aviation\nAnd they go exciting stuff [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah it's a play motor come ladies and gentleman we really do ah we've got the Obama secret\nPlan is\nTo validate the or the a presidential election\nYou know when Hillary won [laughter] where are you worried that can tell you a way we've got some\nThe FBI I've got hold of a guy with a plan dive bomb on the national mall on election day we go back and uh we've got Kanye West wing\nBuilders contractors and serious do it yourself or just know that you find most is the one stop shop for high quality building materials like certain T roofing with more than three hundred who've and colors and options to choose from and quality standards that lead the industry you can rest easy knowing certain gene as you cover\nWith several locations job site delivery spawn and roses always close to your next job\nMy easier build better which\nIt step Wagner for in the morning show here I've experienced a huge positive change in my life they're going to mentality and guys you can too low to USA dot com is the website it's covered by insurance\nYou're asking what it is well they will help you with the kinds of things you need to be a better husband father worker man friend whatever it is low T usa dot com cause low testosterone can be an issue with any guy at any age covered by insurance you're first hurdle is cleared called to make your appointment today three one nine seven seven force\nSeventy nine Seventy nine look around\nYou see that even though this all began if someone's dream this book to me\nSo when people say American families insurance protects thing we should go ahead\nFor people to hear something or other than that the stock market was going down for ... months in a row but I look at a you\nKnow I look at this as you know basically a a very very good thing that you have to you have to if you appreciate gains you have to also accept losses along the way but I I think more importantly what we're trying to teach\nNew people in the office and we had a hundred and forty four new appointments in the office and twenty a Seventeen we have an added them up uh this year yet I'm\nTrying to teach new people is let's try to match your portfolio up\nWith your stage in life ... whatever your stage in life is and what's your definition of investing let's start out with that mine is I Want to put in money now to create income sources for for my future well yeah that's what mine is\nUm but everybody has a different definition of investing\nOr some is by low you know sell high and I'm I'm gonna kick the silver to Matt Matt ... you've been doing this a long time and ah you've been around a or at least during one recession\nAnd you've been around since one very long recovery so we've had a a a nice guy and he's still alive through the whole bill a lot of 'em and he looks great but a map way which is harder and the investment businesses it harder to\nBuy low or is it harder to sell high\nWhile it's a great question a lot of money is emotional money is very emotional so\nI'm obviously we don't have a crystal ball so knowing where we're buying high and selling low is you know is is is the hardest point but um\nWhen you talked about buying low buying low compared to what I guess you would say\nI'm selling it high compared to what you know and what what timeframe because\nYou know ... if I held held up the stock market church today and our our our we Hi I'm based on everything in the past you would say yes we're probably close to pretty close to an all time high [laughter] but but if I ask you this question Justin early high ... Thirty years from now yeah but what do you say I\nDon't know probably not probably not cause if we've gone\nFrom ... think back to where we were in a way I mean we're looking we're close uh maybe eight thousand\nYeah I mean that was a good day back then here we are we closed that twenty I'm pulling this up here twenty five thousand to sixty two\nNow from ten years ago to today fantastic I mean I was three hundred percent there but compared to you know two months ago holy cow you know sell the kid's mortgage the house and you don't listen to ...\nYou know I yeah I think it's really difficult to do both you know I think that uh uh you have to try to buy low and we talked a little bit adjusted about Warren Buffett or before the show and ah you know why in the world does he have a hundred billion dollars in cash a yielding maybe next\nTo nothing blackmailed [laughter]\nI'll black or do you ask anybody for money it's a you know he he's waiting for that or there's a there's a little speeds that he gives a once a once every decade or so\nThe or the clouds and the you know the uh the ... the hearts and dog living together and yet at various stopped flying letters or there's just things that happened in the economy we're in cycles down and he's ready he's ready to pounce on and by four to six dollars yeah hair and that's\nWhat is that is what he's always that it's very difficult I mean I started out you know in college at northern Iowa you know I bought\nThey they had me by a book for sixty dollars to teach me how to uh buy low and sell high on the book for sixty bucks and then at the end of the semester I sold it for ten so that same\nBook now is we're going on by the way\nYou you know it's really difficult I you know I don't know which is a which is harder but uh you know we have been teaching a lot of people that you know as you were nearing retirement and we've had the stock market up over three hundred percent\nYou know let's not fall asleep at the wheel it's okay to lock in some games if you're going to lock in some gains what I never ever liked about this market was it just didn't pay any income yeah you know historically stock should be paying about four to four and a half percent\nI'm In ... and there's a lot of factory workers company workers in town that er they've actually been taking their stock dividends out over the years and they've been going up and up\nOh this market pays less than half of that now I'm In evidence and uh you know I Know our company president Jeff Johnston or he's not a big fan of the target date retirement funds that a lot of ... ah four one K. a\nHave in there a lot of people own I'm not a big fan of an ... of them either because guess what a target date fund\nPays for evidence\n[noise]\nI'm I'm I I don't even know to take a step [laughter]\nZero I was going to say ... ad mail one you know ... where are you going to find some income if you're nearing retirement ... if you're in retirement for God Forbid you got to push off later now I mean they company close I'm fifty nine I was planning on retiring at sixty five oh they shut down what am I going to do you know\nThe last thing you want to do is is what we what we saw people do\n'em at the end of the tech bubble and they had to go back to work or they were they just weren't diversified enough in their portfolio and they didn't have enough safe stuff\nIn their portfolios so um it's okay to be worried now I'm you know I'm telling everybody it's okay to be worried now if you're nearing retirement or if you're in retirement um and the example I always give us how many years that the farmers enjoy seven dollar corn ... how many years was that\nTwo or three two or three I think probably to you and a lot of farmers who did very well yeah but now look you know now look where things are right we want to use his name it was back in at the end of World War two or three twenty five three forty five maybe as you know I've seen the numbers today but it's not what it was so\nIt it somewhere along the line it reached the end of the a cycle and it went back down so um that's okay if you're at if it's in your if your in your forties and fifties mhm\nAnd you're able to buy low I mean there's that component again I'm but here's the problem you know like like Matt mentioned about investing investing if money is an emotional what the heck is it I mean money is the most emotional well yeah\nUh one of the most emotional things for people out there um sometimes if you look at when people start losing money\nUm losses are magnified losses hurt a lot more than any gains seem to help ... so we're gonna we're gonna watch this market and uh if people haven't re balanced er diversified portfolio enough some people are going to grow a new head\nYeah [laughter] and that one also will be gone yeah yeah and\nThose are usually the people that don't have a a a financial planning or at least have a their definition of investing written down or some formula that they've been taught or just anything written down that involve some of their financial goals\nAnd somebody my age mid mid to late thirties you're you're you've got a long game here you know you've got Thirty years where you you shouldn't you know if you want to if you want to stress yourself out in dire early you watch the market day by day right like oh God it lost two hundred oh oh at great again seven hundred oh God it's five hundred down again\nBut if you're somebody like my parents' age you know what they're getting hearing that retirement age you know obviously then there's you know you can see the cliff they're from where you're standing you don't want to necessarily jump over the edge but you know maybe the ground you're shaking on feels a little shake your ...\nWell you mentioned something just and they're very very important and you said a checking your account mhm and one of the things that that we're seeing people are checking their smart phones a hundred and fifty to two hundred times a day\nIf some of that involves and they're in their thirties and forties if some of that checking their smartphone involves checking what their retirement plan is doing\nYou hit the nail on ahead there they're going to drive themselves crazy over the next Twenty years and really the the frequency that you check your accounts\nYou should uh we always recommend maybe check them two to four times a year\nThat's after you do a complete overhaul yeah you don't get it to where you like it get your portfolio to whatever your stage in life is um if it's creating income if that's your thing get their ... and then check at three to four times a year not three to four times a day it's not going to do any good it's going to drive you crazy\nThat when you talk about money emotional that there there's a company in town in Nineteen eighty six their stock was worth four bucks a share ... guess what it was a Nineteen Ninety six\nTwelve exactly what was it in two thousand two thousand six nights they maybe twenty sixty eight okay it it was up to a hundred and Twenty one dollars this year ...\n... and my question when I'm Talking about how emotional money is is why isn't every single person that's walking out of the plant not a multi million ... million yeah\nEverybody checked the you know they when when when it was four dollars a share their raising kids and they had house payments and they didn't make it a priority when they got closer to retirement it got emotional and they had to watch your networks get trapped in ...\nUm I think we have a a a a a tremendous benefit living in Iowa versus living on the east and west coast in Chicago\nAnd one of my favorites are are customers you know he always reminds me that it's a thousand dollars a month to park in Chicago yeah that's just a part of our you know if you can't go out\nThere and and get people to ah to put money away each month and you're doing them a disservice ... uh because we're we're living here a little Iowa so try to own versus renting you don't have the real estate fluctuations you don't have the home prices fluctuate\nNearly as bad as you do on the east and west coasts as you do here in Iowa so a number a number six or go further what the real estate you look at real estate is a very important investment\nIf Ashley is able to uh somehow maybe a purchase another piece of real estate and maybe start a rental property ... or a buy a duplex or something something to think of another source of income and the future\nIf she looks at a this ten ticket punch card a it's a financial independence\nThis is something these are these or other places where she's going to be able to create income for her retirement\nLet's go to the phone line real quick uh we do have a call coming in through six five zero six hundred and let's go to the local line it is you sir welcome into the were investments of Iowa radio hour on six hundred W empty\nYou know that's you local on any time I guess not\nI wasn't there and what role that he was like OK here's a guy is going to like the fires were off I mean I started to strike up the ban here we go and nothing I'm Sorry John ... the next bunch would\nBe just open up a regular brokerage account we talked about this uh I'm off stage that a a a you know what we call this or we're regret portfolio yeah have some cash and by that darn stock that you thought that ah\nAnd then don't look at it and then you won't have to regret regret it later on you won't have to look back then or Twenty years from now and say just don't buy the stock that Matt bought a what we talked\nAbout Enron look great okay and pay for it should've worked for him either way I read it right or polio as about a thousand bucks on\nA a you're not going to get killed two bad a number eight actually\nLook at your wherever you're working your your employer right now you're so young at forty you want to purchase a disability policy through work or on your own because you have a lot more years of a earning\nIn front of you have the earning power you want to try to protect that now you really don't have a you may have your mom and dad has been a fisheries the need for life insurance in my opinion\nIsn't great at all but the need to protect your future wages is a look at look at uh at at going to your payroll person and end up paying or just starting a disability policy of Matt and I talked about that this morning at the office we're always\nWe're always looking at a increasing our disability coverage in the event that we can't work\nOn the second the last one a pay off your uh pay off your credit card balances each month and I'm the second most important thing that I Would do if I were actually at forty would be to make sure that you have enough money in your emergency fund yeah so\nHave to have six to nine months and in an emergency fund if you get more than that just just look\nThat as an opportunity fun and then that has money that you can invest for your future but the number one punch a that you can do for your financial future at age forty I'm Ashley in being single yes what number one is but guess what the number one investment Ashley can do\nFind out if Warren Buffett has enough you know getting ready to buy up a dating they even good\nOne um yeah merrier area broadcast money won't make you know that's not on it that that could be number eleven members that are both as a bonus track I was eleven a puppet always says uh invest in yourself mhm\nYou know that's yourself if you're the investment so\nA continuing education or pay raises whatever it didn't list or job here but uh invest in yourself along the way it already in the single oh yeah and ah you should be okay but my point as she gets she really gets to be selfish now and and start to do some things to to help\nHelp map out in and help her have a a very successful financial future ahead of her\n... would you be offended if we take a break and let you respond when we come back absolutely you know okay I thought you said absolutely like well never mind will do that but we'll get mass response we come back after bottom of the hour update that we've got another question plus trivia time too\nWill get you a brand new dollar bill and some other goodies from our friends were investments if I was staying with us six thirty five
