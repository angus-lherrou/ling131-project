Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate and\nHe wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans were ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America stands and when John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I\nDo have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective is the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that
