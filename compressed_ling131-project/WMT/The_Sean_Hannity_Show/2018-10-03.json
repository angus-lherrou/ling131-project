Fox News three separate down below suspected of containing a rice and intercept\nThank you Sean Hey Greg good to be here congratulations David on your wonderful new book David is truly one of the best authors I've ever read\nHe's one of the best authors and writers and columnist but it's it's also moved me as I have read these books and to realize I Need to be a better person [laughter] that's what I read the um like All right I'm a piece of crap and I'm One of the Christians that needs to saving part for sure\n[laughter] so do we all and Greg congratulations on your unbelievable success with your book really saying outstanding you\nAll right let me such get into this issue\nNow I asked Lindsey Graham last night and I'll start with you David I said well what if you fall one vote short\nBecause now the the Democrats and the senator from Hawaii the once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigated nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated\nIn every case there's no ... at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and this lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat and they was claiming and now she has\nBacktracked I don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave us for names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she ... tracks on his story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and are these questions and\nThen the entire democratic leftist apparatus have the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand up and defend themselves and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his is to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial\nNever I Would hate to have that kind of instrument\nGuy I have always somebody suppose how was somebody supposed to act\nIf they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're previously wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused and to condemn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you got\nA ... and contrast that with his response on the mark from a column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially legal she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself and it was a mashable report because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair a standard of his behavior in\nHigh school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit\nOr in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time are we even believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David well I I I find that again absurd on its

Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nOnce a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict that the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\n[laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong\nThe thing that they they have handled this what the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...

I I just this there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter Lindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way assaulted a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office apparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're going to have to start kicking people out of ... of these\nSenate buildings income congressional offices because I'm going to somebody's going to get hurt [noise]\nUm and I'm all for free speech but\nYou ought to be able to walk out your door and not get surrounded by groups of people screaming at you if you represent in the country Mitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and\nSo we'll see what that means from his vantage points uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done Ford complaining the FBI never contacted her but they have a story what else did they need\nMoney due to visit your door for my for no dot com [noise] USA\nPossible equal housing Linder remember if I see\nUS Cellular where you'll get national coverage a little bit of anywhere\nYou always have ruled\nBy Windsor windows\nThe\nBy week has gone by by as they say that it's time to\nPlay football eight straight weeks of a cat and football coming out you're starting this weekend up in Minneapolis shows ...\nEnjoy the entire month of September at home [noise] and now they go out on the road for over the next five Saturday's the only home game will be home coming\nInto the middle of this month October here already in a couple of weeks she'll be home to pick out\nThe Maryland ... but in the meantime it's off to bring up all of the renewal that great rivalry that is Floyd Rosedale\nMortar battle call it what you will Minnesota's homecoming there one hundred were coming in school history has the fourteenth time they hosted the ... homecoming [laughter]\nSo that tells you right out of the gate the battle the fandom to go for found them in the twin cities I have a yard will be all weather up in the ... for allowed an unruly no doubt as they try to Russell Floyd back off the hook I quit my truck ... to look good for a number of years he's been\nRaising 'em at Iowa corn [noise]\nAnd to really look the best for the better for the ...\nThree in this series and a five of the last six seven of the last ten\nAgainst the golfers and hope to make it for in a row on Saturday afternoon to thirty here on the Hawkeye radio network ... coverage with the\n...
