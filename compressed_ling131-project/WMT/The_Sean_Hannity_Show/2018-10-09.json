Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago with this was about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents\nFor the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting a immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we've been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday in this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but not far not produce including Peter Struck personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the roof or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow if you're getting bits and pieces of information about what's\nHappened there there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but\nUh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives\nThat are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia that\nAdded the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire our own people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh endless of first happened\nIn August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call say\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think my first\nWith the story in March of Seventy yes\nAbsolutely said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to\nBe charged right ... ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah it's basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nWhat happened to you with the ... application warrants a I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize thing of our intelligence is another big issue and I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again\nThat these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy they'll write so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of laps in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... Mehra as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to a lot of ...

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking\nOr any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't\nThink there's any doubt there's no doubt at all\nThat the ... in the hospital regime of Russia be him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and the constantly cite\nCyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nAnd how much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's same ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known\nOh Julian Assange is wanted his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\n... I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with was with this uh the OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the polar\nCan't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do you know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look it over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen\nEvery other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we don't have any doubt that foreign uh services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously\nWe've been on basically since about two thirty this afternoon I'm with tornado warning coverage of they've just come out with numerous warnings and again another warning expected very very shortly this warning officially in effect until sex and the rotation itself is just beginning to move out of that warning box\nCap so places like center point this'll prime messages to the east a central city you could get grazed by some of the um but probably right in between there between Walker and cog in central city and center point that rectangle there is probably going to be a spot that winds up\nComing up your way I'm looking at our way to the north or let's go to max to on a Cedar Rapids north camera will keep an eye on this but again not much has changed from what it was earlier\nIt's about the same scenario here and uh and the I think the only the only thing that we have to watch for with this storm cell is in the fact that it does try and ramp up again in this localized environment here in northern Len county\nWe may have the potential of that are right now we're not seeing any potential that at this moment\nUh we'll we'll definitely keep an eye on it are going for these have though had a history of producing some strong reports outside of Linn county\nYeah if you joined us back at two thirty you notice that we had if we can go back to max one please um we had numerous reports of storm reports across the street on with the past twenty four hours\nI'm In since ... since two thirty we've really added to those reports and numerous reports\nOf funnel cloud reports and some tornado reports which just go into the TV nine viewing area took a look at those reports alone\nAnd you notice they are in northern power Sheikh tame as well as southern areas of Benton county will highlight some of those for you I'm first let's go to that tornado warning this is the extension on the tornado warning we've been talking about how we'll see what the weather service has done they have issued that tornado warning\nThat a little farther east center pointed orders\nCentral city it also includes collagen six Fifteen makes sense with a shorter timeframe due to the movement um it's moving pretty rapidly off to the north eastern about forty miles per hour so that's\nUm that's probably why we're seeing that shorter timeframe\nUm again this does include the city of robin's you're just beginning to see that moved here north it will include Alberto ... in central city I'm so far has not been extended out of Linn county says is strictly for a small portion of Linn county and that will be in effect until six Fifteen so that takes us probably\nAll for the next to twenty five minutes or so as a storm continues to move through so the warnings do continue we continue following in many ways\nUm and this is a storm that we have been following sense of developed down in areas of Kirkuk in Washington County moving off towards the north still nothing in the way of any tornadic report from the storms\nNor any or damage reports from any of the storms that have moved across eastern Iowa oh we'll take a look at some rainfall totals a little bit later but Jim city can still looking a again ominous\nPretty much that's how things are at right now and the Cedar Rapids north city camp\nAnd uh it's a it's more of a shorter fused warning now that goes till six Fifteen or just to the west the central city and uh does include the collagen area a central city or right on the line and the other ... so I think you can be safely included in that\nUm Albert that you're firmly in that and uh that's continuing to move its way up towards the north and east and it is fast it's it's\nAbout forty miles an hour and what will continue to do here what we're seeing is the road [noise]\nPleased to mediate ... cable channel twenty two for detailed emergency alert information but\nThe wall right there and that goes to the north and east it'll be slowly moving away from what the Cedar Rapids north ... able to see a will continue to keep an eye as long as we can keep a visual on that but again the rotation of the three ... minor at this point\nAgain you can see that as we take a look at our velocity product looking at the rotation and the storm or just to the south west of elborn out or to interstate treaty that's kind of a spot that we're seeing that rotation and right now again as the storm continues to move off toward the north so it's\nIn the ... area right now or just off to your west\nI'm as it heads up farther toward the north that rotation has maintained certainly but as I mentioned we haven't seen anything in the wake come out of this storm a no damage reports no high wind reports\nUm and certainly has its move through more populated area you would expect to hear some reports has those storms Ruth or we're going to check in our weather lab right now meteorologist Corey Thompson with us again and Corey just real curious anything at all on chat or any place that you're seeing of evening wind gust report [noise]\nHonestly Joe we haven't had really anything yet so we just saw report come through on the chat up some that rotation in the clouds starting to tighten up a little bit near Robin ...\nAM radio spotter out there and then county or the other than that no damage reports which again is a really good thing considering the number of tornado warnings we've dealt with today but that area of rotation and still does exist let's say north of Robbins and west of alber net [noise]\nThings going on we appreciate that report um let's go ahead we have some video from Hiawatha understand of the storm as was\nMoving through let's take a look and see 'em\nAgain the same type lowering we've been watching as the storm has been moving through also got a photo I'm from a little farther west of this location as well I'm near the pillow area I'm as that storm was moving through again\nJust a general lowering the cloud based um nothing that really looks like any stronger tight rotation here a which is some good news uh that's going to be watching for is this\nPart of the storm would pass through 'em and that's where you would again see that potential for the tornado to develop but again no tornadoes have been developing out of this storm as it's moved to the north yet that rotation still maintains itself um\n[noise] then again as you can see it or against Fillon impressive looking stormed a very fast moving storm didn't want to put a storm track on that real quick\nUm as that storm moves than or thoughts go ahead and do that I think it was when we got about forty miles per hour or so that's a that's more rapidly than some of the storms generally as we move through the afternoon hours we've seen that oh anywhere from about oh Fifteen to twenty five miles per hour at times\nUh buffalo creek county park about six sixteen ... around six sixteen Robbins in her own six twenty and Ryan if it continues that movement it would be in your area around six twenty forces the second round\nFor Robin are Ryan seeing some of those storms I'll move across Syria was going to be some storm reports early if you have something ... let me know but I'm a kind of run through some of the storm reports that we've had\n'em and we were doing earlier when that tornado warning was extended and you see it's growing on the bottom of your screen as well so kind of keep that in mind if you're just joining us um or now just about the time of our six o'clock news um so it's something that we will continue to watch and follow as we head toward news time\nUm but here's the storm reports that we've had one report\nWe did have back across Benton county and Blair's town that was a brief touched down near Blair sound that was one of the confirmed reports we had that happened at three forty eight in addition to that confirmed report we also had a report in\nNorthern near policy county the tornado and you're Brooklyn a train spotter reporter to trade about five miles north northeast of highway one forty six that again was back at for Nineteen\nHas that storm continue to move to the north we did have additional tornado reports by social media or that happened at four twenty I'm In addition to that we all sort of reporting from that same location on near the Chelsea area ... ... works tornado reported off to the north\nUm again along and then one eighty six on I eighty and power she county that again earlier this afternoon\nAs that storm continued to move to the north we had a funnel cloud report\nA private citizen so to follow clouds were just a few minutes that's what we saw across eastern Iowa earlier as well with that storm wrangle live from our city can\nHad a report of a tornado on the ground for law enforcement in Toledo although have zero storm reports as far as damage from that storm and in addition and finding 'em as meteorologists Corey Tom Sawyer reported earlier there was also a report of a tornado in that area that happened about four fifty five so that's the last\nTime that we've had any reports of any sort of storm reports in the area\nNow let's go ahead and take a look at why do right now\nUp to eighty nine to pinpoint Doppler radar it again will show the scattered nature of the showers and storms that are moving through any very isolated nature of any severe weather is just across the northern areas of Linn county with heavy rains moving in from the south we're going to leave you briefly to run are open for our six o'clock news will join your back with continuous storm coverage\nHas more showers and storms push across the street with a severe and had any rain threat\nCasey orgy TV nine from your twenty four hour news source is Casey orange ETV nine news at six [noise]\nI mean your allergist Joe inches alongside meteorologist Cairo marrying meteorologist Corey Thompson is back in our weather to why we have been with you since early this afternoon with severe weather coverage here on TV nine continuous severe weather coverage\nAs we've had numerous tornado warnings across eastern Iowa I Would bet we've had close to a dozen tornado warnings in fact Corey add up the number of tornado warnings that we have and you have a chance and we'll get that from you in just a second\nThe good news is as these warnings have been issued we so far into the TV nine newsroom or through social media have had zero reports of any damage from the storm so that is the best news we could have\nWhen you have that many reports or tornado warnings that are issued\nYeah then we've only had one final report that we saw at least on our city can network back in ... a couple of brief touchdown reported likely in rural areas we're not seeing any structural or tree damage so it's been about as good as it can be so far given the amount of warnings with that one\nUm again hardly is legitimate warnings absolutely there is rotation in these storms and we were showing you throughout the entire event and if that rotation\nJust makes it to the ground that's all it needs to do you have damage of a storm that's now producing the tornado and you need to be in a safe spot so absolutely absolutely well done by the weather service to watch these cells and warn them as they've been moving off towards the north and east\nI'm the storm now is approaching southern areas of Delaware county so those of you in the Ryan area you want to be watching that storm as it moves through extreme extreme southeastern areas you can and county right now seeing some heavy rains just south of Monte cognitive you're starting to see some of the heavy rains could be some gusty winds is moving\nTrue as well the rotation still is kind of show junior the Paris area I'm off to the west of cog in a moving off to the north in slightly northeast possibly at about forty miles per hour so again\nSomething we continue to watch just give me an indication of a lightning that we've seen with the storms as they move through just in the past our many times we have our our big tornado outbreaks you see a lot on the way of lightning with these storms bullets pinpoint you can see there hasn't been much at all in fact we'll put a loop on that\nVery isolated storm is very very little in the way of lightning as they move through as well so certainly not a high energy storm in that sense but\nEnough to produce the potential for some rotation the storms as they move through the area as well and that's what again as we always tell us from spring now into fall can lead to turn addict formation front and back to the west more of a heavy rain event although I Do see between the Des Moines into land to now they did extend the tornado warning a little farther to the north well off\nTo our west that one's been producing some issues down there is southwestern sections of Iowa but the good news that I can see out of this loop right now is that we do have some scattered heavy rainfall obviously towards the Tampa area but we're not seeing any more warnings with any any of that at this point uh which is very good I have\nTo think that this was all pretty conditional the daytime hating and the amount of wind shear that we've had so far today and it does appear like things are starting to stabilize a little bit from the tornado warnings standpoint so again this warning goes until six Fifteen officially about two or three more minutes or so\nAgain from Paris just to the west of the ... areas what we're monitoring at this time [noise] uh right now it just it doesn't appear like it it needs an extension so we'll see what the National Weather service wants to do on this uh right now they're official warning goes until six Fifteen\nAt it just it doesn't appear like they are the threat is too much beyond that small area of northern Linn county at this point Frank that might possibly rotate\nA will certainly be keeping an eye on that um as we had to uh next couple of hours going to wait to see what the National Weather service wants to do\nUm they will give us an indication of whether they're going to let this warning expire or will be extended\nUm and then we can possibly even getting a little our newscast look he's been sitting off to our rights were to newscast waiting to give you the news and she's still sitting there waiting so she's uh she's going to be there and ready to go um to give you the news of the day if we can get to that if this tornado warning is indeed expiring at six thirty six Fifteen\nAgain just about two minutes left 'em in the warning itself now moving into southern areas of\nDelaware county into southern areas of you can and county do onto while we have a chance um give you a look at our rivers um 'cause that's something you certainly would have been joining us during our six o'clock news to see\nThe senior at a glance really easy way to take a look at it um when you see the forecast which is in the center column that's the crash that's expected so let's go to Cedar Falls expecting crafted Ninety five to\nThat happens Saturday morning that's a major state now mine are staging Waterloo with across the Eighteen eight that happens friday morning Eighteen six in Vinton friday at seven o'clock that would be also a moderate stage\nA major stage that Eighteen point six in Cedar Rapids that Saturday evening so again that's updated\nAnd these are forecast so I Want you to be aware of that sixteen point eight expected and cones bill that Tuesday Morning north ... cigarettes and you're going to go to major flood stage and stay there into the weekend a twenty two five you're expected crashed that happens friday morning\nOn the Mississippi interview costs are rising toward toward moderate flood stage staying at the minor level at Seventeen point nine but getting very close and that would happen early next week Ringo you're going to bounce around major stage a Nineteen now the highest expected Thursday about one o'clock\nIn the Iowa City hide your craft shows against 'em ups and downs as we watched twenty two point nine now expected getting close to the modern flood stage that happens early next week and our culture\nRight now I'm English river Eighteen point eight um and still we starting to fall which is along the river mistakes in the rain expected during the next twenty four hours\nOkay we're going to wrap up our continuous severe weather coverage as the tornado warning for northern Lincoln county is allowed to expire so what's a low a cut away point for our ... media uh uh sponsors and our partners\nUh hot under five seven and Ninety six five kiss country will let you go back to regular programming now\nThis is news radio six hundred W empty your severe weather station\nAnd uh we're not seeing an extension of a a tornado warning or bad even for any counties to the north of land and the northern Wayne County\nA tornado warning is allowed to expire at a ... that would be at six fifty yeah so about\n... actually just a right about now however tornado watch continues that will be in effect for a majority of the W empty listening area that's going to go did that they extend that 'til ten or was it ...\nBoth ... till ten or ... will do a double check that and see where where it's at right now the original a forecast point for completion was ... when they issued about two two thirty this after\nNine of things have happened between now and we've got more storms now in central Iowa again coming out of Des Moines that are kicking off more tornado warnings there too yeah we're not quite done yet this evening\nOkay we're going to keep an eye on it but first we're going to take care or opportunity to break away\nAnd uh you know catch up on some commercials and also we're going to\nKeep you up to date with what's going on a on a statewide a message up until about seven o'clock this evening so hang in there with us we'll keep you up to date with all the way this weather details but no active warnings right now we have no active warnings and the W. emptied lifting area we do have a tornado watch that's been a fact\nUh and I believe it's either nine ten o'clock we're going to check that they may have extended out once the storms popped up and they needed a little bit more time\nFrame for these a tornado watch counties to be inspired I also think they kind of\nA edits new county's been in it was a total different mixture counties that were originally originally we were on the eastern edge it's something that extend it all the way back in the central Iowa obviously there was a ... vote in central Iowa as it can tell to spark off some tornadoes\nBut being on the fringe I thought okay maybe wouldn't get it but active fringe\nOn that warning for Linn county as you want to ever talk on the phone when I was home with me to go I mean right on the line I mean our the capital in county storms clouds the other half of Linn county looking up towards the east was sunny you know fantastic out of work\nIncredible a lot of people get some are pretty amazing pictures and your wife has some great they've got to do from from your eyes so that we got a quite a few uh pictures to cut a record the
