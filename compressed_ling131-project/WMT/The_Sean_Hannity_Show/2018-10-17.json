I mentioned they went to Michigan a couple of weeks ago and got throttle they're forty two Twenty one but\nNot many teams are going into Michigan these days [noise] against that defense\nAnd scoring points or let alone putting up a a bunch of yard which I but they'd they'd be I suppose they beat the teams are they were supposed to beat the rented up by Minnesota at home\nOr they uh they destroyed
