got two questions unrelated to each other but that was going to ask 'em what what disadvantages endorsed vantage is have you experienced now by having Brian\n... up in the press box for one season and then down on the ... you are this season and unrelated to that I was just wondering what the rules and regulations are on it you want to recruit a student athlete that might go to school out in Pennsylvania and when you're visiting\nAnd playing for example this weekend um are you allowed owes player when you were on the road\nThose are both great questions on ... on a in a time we're in a visitor stadium and uh it's probably not as as apt to happen in Pennsylvania but as you might imagine in the Midwest a typical you know this especially the surrounding states uh there's some guys at the games typically the you know we're we're hurting also the\nThe way the rule reads as we're we're not allowed to have any contact at all obviously we can't provide tickets for prospects on the road and we can do to an ... or we can give her a prospect free tickets they sign up for him and uh that's that's what there were a lot of to give them a so the the host institution has to do that\nAnd now we're not supposed to have any verbal contact with them a much much like when we go into a school before a contact period you're not supposed to have an interaction with her Kurt also so the host team can do that and I know in China QC are all recruits typically now they're in the south end zone\nAnd pre game they move up once again gets going up into the recruiting section\nSaw and it'll be the same way on the road with all the other institutions so that that's a great question and uh but you know regarding Brian\nIt really I think you know I prefer to do to whoever it is called plays and no one can O'Keefe was there his preference was to be\nOn the field and um you know break prefer to be up in the box it's a little bit more sterile up there obviously you get a better better view of the of the whole scenario and um you know Brian started up there but I think he just he feels a lot more comfortable down on the sideline where he's able to interact with the players\nYou know face to face and then I think the key component is you know with him coming down somebody upstairs has to be providing really good information 'cause\nWe're all depending on that but especially the guy called plays them in this case to kill them ... moved up there and done a great job with that so I think he's he's definitely more comfortable working this way and uh you know can be in the quarterbacks coach she's out on the field also I think that is\nUm [noise] you know from my experience I think that that helps a lot on the quarterbacks coach can can see the see the quarterback not just you know talk to them on a phone but actually see him you know just kind of try to read read uh the situation a little bit and it gets really beneficial so\nI think we all feel good about that that part of things and uh you know we talked a little bit earlier and a show about the staff working well together and it gets it was probably one more step in this whole process\nBut didn't dawn on me to Kirk until\nThese road games where a concert hall\nBut I see a more thorough than a home particularly as figure the coaching staff would you really lay a lot of responsibility undergrad assistance they're up in the booth and down on the field with you as well and I think that's tremendous uh on the job training it\nThat it's critical with those guys do and and uh oh I see him tonight commentary and I'll give you another one here in a minute but a regret assistance you know we ask a lot of them they they do a lot of the managers they do a lot of things behind the scenes it's to me out as do the same thing they on pack the bags we get back at midnight and\nYou know I mean those guys do all kinds of stuff nobody has any clue ... through the same thing they make our jobs a lot a lot easier in the ... you know we're able to function early focus on the football part of things instead of some logistical stuff\nBut then on top of it yeah they'll they'll coach and uh we all have responsibility\nAlthough we're doing teen periods they run the voice team which is not an easy job I can tell you that from experience I got to go back you know thirty seven years now that it's a really challenging job it's a very important job\nUh for the team to prepare and then ended with the individual parents or coach in God's hands on coaching them group pork same thing and\nSo it is it's a great great we learn suddenly weight orange like me and our presence in any business I think that's that's how you learn and uh you know we've been fortunate we've had great guys\nWorking on that I'll give you another a just a little example of dumb things in this world right so our players when we go to you know for home or a way they get for tickets you know no big deal in Atlanta ga same thing we go to a ball game All right they give players six tickets now get so many years you\nNow now they they don't ... are still getting poor but they bumped the players they don't bumped the

with Andre Patterson out the deep end scored needed by George Edwards and of course my ... and Robert joins us now\nFor for those not super familiar with who you are or like like where you come from um where where are you from and then where have you been football wise\nYeah I've uh I'm from El Paso Texas I played college would leave there at the University of Texas at El Paso\nAfter that I had a cup of tea I was on a practice squad in the NFL owes with tendency Carolina and so you're a CFL\nGot into coaching after that went back to Utah and I'd been there for six seven years I spent there as a line backers coaching graduate assistant and was elevated to line backers coach and I was blessed that my first year as linebacker coach who got the defensive coordinator name Andre Patterson\nAnd came here just changed my life as a the best teacher I've ever been around and and I we clicked right away and and I think he got tired of me asking them questions day by day but I was his linebackers coach I was there until twenty or after twenty fourteen I got the call here\nTo come interviewed for the assistant defensive line job I've been here ever since twenty fifty two 'til now\nAs many heard a late yesterday an earlier today Everson Griffin deepens a band has returned to the Minnesota Vikings ...\nGone talk about the work view and Andre put in with Stephen whether lay ju ju get Stephen to perform on a game in game out basis quite honestly at a very high level\nYou know all it was is is just watching Steven finally it clicked for Steve and all the work that we had done which do we had been doing since he's been here and and that's the big thing with Andre you know we don't ramp it up and slow it down\nOr the standard is the standard and we continue to teach and preach the right ways to do things in for Steve and it was all about feeling it and having confidence and being a physical football player where he had come from you kind of been always\nBeen athletic enough to get away with it and then this Lee you have to have a good mix of both physicality and athleticism saving I preferred the meal just clicked quicker and so for Steve and you're just using that aspect of his game kick in he's competing with his power now he's still being athletic it's not one or the other\nAnd uh and and so everything's starting to click for him and it's really a testament to his hard work in his diligence to stay with it so we're we're really blessed that Steven stepped up to the plate\nSo when you guys lose younger players like ... step in the free agency or or if ... you know who knows what the Arizona Cardinals mean that the you you put so much technique why is working to them it's almost like they're more than football family they they become like your children you work with them so much\nIt it has to be difficult when they leave right\nOh yeah people think it's easy I think maybe for other teams 'cause they you know I think we put in we're working towards young guys than a lot of teams doing this league uh but you talk about those two guys that hurt me hurt me personally that you're losing somebody that you put\nA lot of time into and so that's where I think that's what makes us different Andres always said if you're wearing the Viking on your Viking defensive line we're going to coach you as hard as we coach ever seen griffey as ours we coach\nA limbo Joe so if you're going to get coached so if you're a practice one guy and you're wearing the uniform just what you buried here to our standard because we are going to coach a\nSo you don't slip through the cracks in our room I take a lot of pride in helping on trade with that\nBut it does when when you see a guy like some more stuff and go and then you run into their coaches and they're like oh yeah we love him he's doing great and\nThey try to act like they did something with them but hey that's the word we put them together and ... is a great example of that interview with man I miss a you know I'm working with him and then and I love the guys in the room but you you lose those guys and you just missed a day to day working with them watching and continue to get better\nAnd Robert

throwing it outside creating a scene\nIn a hostile environment I\nDon't see conservatives doing that and so we have this sad tragedy today where we have suspicious packages now sent to people like uh the Clintons and Obama and CNN and and looks like Maxine Waters\nAnd somehow immediately ... gets turned into blame conservatives blame talk radio blame Fox News my name is mentioned in particular and

the tour our bus driver headed down a one way street only do encounter a double park delivery ran around which he couldn't pass\nHoping for a quick return to the van driver we sat way to\nI had the front seat and a good view of all the action soon the New York city horns kicked in from the vehicles stacked up behind us most of which I assume didn't know our predicament\nAll how the horns honk is only the horns honk in New York City it's a horn honking town I'm sure there's a niche business for horn repairing replacement there that does very well\nAfter about five minutes stuck behind this delivery van while listening to the horns our tour guide Jim started to get a little impatient and went to the embassy of perhaps the keys might be in it\nHe came back with the word on no keys but there was a note on the van seat with the drivers telephone number on it Ah yes again on Monday and then why you see they block the street and leave a note\nGym says he left a message with the phone number and also did a text\nNow a driver of one of the cars behind us\nHas decided to stop blowing his horn and has come to take positive action on the delivery vans he is gripping the back we'll oil and the lifting and pulling motion as a demonstration to us on the bus\nAnd how we can pull this vehicle out all the way if we'll come out and help him receiving no response she smiles at all the eyes tearing at him from our bus windows\nA yes or down only and then why is she\nNow ten minutes has elapsed and the horn blowing behind us has subsided somewhat as drivers have become aware of our problem except for the recent arrivals to the blockade who are now not as aggravating since their horns are blocked back in the distance things are continuing to pile up\nNow our bus driver gets out to measure how much room he actually has between us and the car parked at the curb across from the blockade and ran with a thought that perhaps she can possibly squeezes us through no such luck as he ... and shakes his head it's to try\nTo hold his moments later that cat has arrived the delivery van driver emerges from one of the buildings and went on a wave or look jumps into his van and drives off he leaves in a rapid retreat to escape the wrath of a block long line of aggravated horn blowing drivers\nThe phone message from our guide Tim get through maybe but we'll never know
