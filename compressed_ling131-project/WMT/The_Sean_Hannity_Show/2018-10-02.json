Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nEssentially she shares that listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited 'til we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say go ahead\nAnd actually this weekend Mr President you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat does it have to do is read I don't mind answer the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is kind of and and I know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever trick or treat yelled will pass through Congress her a I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nOr industrial opposite our country loves it or if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight now or to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news\nEight hundred nine four one showing has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators oh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett\nKavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week\nIf they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professional forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron York ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly at an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending lady was totally uncorroborated sauces that is that really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe something while he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into\nA an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules to get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me it would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me know players trying for a minute because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through\nWhen you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example so you're getting you know wondering Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out this terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who were prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose then plainly state it is that he will destroy the government\nUnless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of Trump Administration you harass them and the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at that at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promise last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know ... and an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it um when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people because if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever or not we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team total liar total fabrication trend over a year or is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation they they don't\nAnd

you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times they've found now they've vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to\nBe watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a\nHat but but it\nUp you know the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely sunny and the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself\nPrior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is\nOne thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the whole to the people and I said I've course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look hit hit companies coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nWhat the FBI does to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same day 'cause the FBI can't as ... as well make that cat force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my protection\nUnder that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she says like puppet he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it sounds so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days\nIt to kind of work up at her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York and they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I track there even if they cut about ... you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nAnd they'll they'll get their state in it and I think if you look at the people out there\nThan I don't make any holding hands and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information that's it there was a thrill chosen and\nMaybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as

sixty one\nThe Roger Maris broke baseball's most cherished record that was the day that marriage is playing for the New York Yankees hit is\nSixty first home run of the season and the final game of the regular season to break Babe Ruth thirty four year old major league record of sixty homers in a season and it may have been the most unpopular breaking of a record in the history of sports I remember well working in my early days in broadcasting at the time\nI'd never seen Ruth play he was before my time I only knew him through books as the popular baseball legend that was friendly to kids\nI'd once given a school speech about him\nAnd I just didn't want Roger Maris to break the babes most hallowed record but I wasn't alone new to most of the baseball fans across the country it's same\nMarriage said come to the Yankees the season before and was perceived as a Yankee outsider if anyone was to break the babes home run record the Yankee fans wanted it to be the popular Yankees centerfield slugger Mickey Mantle\nThe two of them do without during that Nineteen sixty one season for the home run lead with first one and then the other leading it then mammal got injured leaving the babe Ruth ...\nThere was also a personality issue with ... he was as different from the friendly outgoing quotable Babe Ruth was you could get he was a quiet private type of person blunt spoken and perceived as somewhat surly\nAnother factor against marriage was the the American League had admitted to new teams for that Nineteen sixty one season and to maintain a balance scheduled had increased the number of games to be played from a hundred and fifty four to hundred sixty two\nIn mid season the baseball commissioner forward Frick who'd been at admitted close friend of Babe Ruth\nDeclared that unless Ruth's record was broken in the first one hundred fifty four games the number of games that Ruth could play in setting the record the near record will be shown in the record books with an asterisk diluting it was not the true record\nIn September ... began to crumble emotionally under the pressure of it all and his hair began coming out in clumps and he admitted later that the intense media coverage and fan and media criticism nearly drove him to a nervous breakdown\nMaris wound up with fifty nine home runs after the Yankees one hundred fifty for the game so the asterisk was assured every broke Babe Ruth's record\nHe tied Ruth's record of sixty a couple of games later and then broke up with is sixty first in the fourth inning of the final game of the regular season later Maris would say that it might have been better for him personally had he not broken the record or even threatened at\nHis record lasted a similar number of years to Babe Ruth's record when it was broken during the steroid dominated years\nLeaving those records even more changes than his marriage has been left out of the baseball hall of fame because his overall career wasn't good enough leaving the sixty one homers in the category of flash in the pan\nThe steroid guys are similarly being shunned by the hall with all that said at least Babe Ruth sixty home runs in Nineteen twenty seven is unquestioned in any way with the baby also regarded by many baseball historians has the greatest\nPlayer ever play the game and as you can tell I'm totally on board with all of that\nIt's a double you on the twenty sixth annual majestic Alaska cruise will travel to six through the twenty first and we'd love to have you along with starting with the seven days on line as we

Fox News as the FBI continue its investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh some lawmakers say they want to hear the results of the investigation before planning a vote on his confirmation regret\nEither way you got to plan right I mean you have to uh you have to start a a writing some things down on paper now and I think that uh I'm going to jump in and just say that the um what I always like to do wreck when somebody gets close to retirement is try to identify their relationship with the money\nAnd so in other words I Want to figure out how much income they're going to need for some people it's on a monthly basis for some people they look at money coming in each week but trying to identify how\nNeeds to come in so when they go out to dinner they don't have to order the special um every time and retirement so in other words they they can actually go out and in order what they want and ah everybody's different what this level of income I I Can't tell you what Rick says but\nUh I Will tell you that we need to identify that as one of the first things\nUm and if you do that if you get it get it down to maybe fifty dollar swing either way each month or each week however\nA wreck looks at that uh then then you're going to be able to plug that into a financial plan your you're going to be able to take into consideration that the prices of things go up each year\nAnd then you're going to find out rex life expectancy all that other good stuff I think it starts with rex relationship with money that's just my take on it I Know the guys are chopping at the vet here to shop and you can feel ... and ... they're ready to go\nTo Matt Matt Seaton like a piece of salary over\nHere [laughter] yeah and that maybe you at home can hear him but he's shy Jim but\nYeah I think a ... everything starts with the planning process and setting ... setting realistic expectations\nI'm you know a lot of times the first time people ever think about\nWhat retirement really looks like and what they're actually going to do and how much money they're going to need is when they sit down and and they pick out a date so you know it's it's really emotional because you can make you know three types of decisions when it comes to retirement and you can make your decisions based on your opinions\nYou can make them based on facts or you can based making based on the emotions and you want to make sure that you have solid facts\nAre that you're going to make your financial decisions on a well when it comes to sitting down and doing your retirement planning\nSo Casey yeah no I I actually appreciate that I guess because I had a little bit of a different take I think when I'm On both you guys to take a look at it you know I think the money part of it is very important\nUm which is really what you guys are coming from but you know there's some other things we got to consider as well um you know just based on the way that the question is phrase um it would seem to me and again this is probably mean making a little bit of a leap making a little bit of an assumption\nI think the money thing almost sounds like it's already taken care of right now I'm now I I Would absolutely hundred percent agree with both you guys that you know in in you know and in our opinion\nUm you'll probably starting with a financial plan and making sure you go through and mathematically validate that you are assumptions are able are correct in there that they're able to kick you out in terms of a financial plan or the length of time\nBecause that's one of the things that we are that we're looking at constantly now right as life expectancy how long people are going to be around\nUm how what the length of time that they're going to have on that plan but there are other aspects that we got to consider as well\nLet's go to the phones and we'll pick up the eight hundred three three to five four zero one line and said good a good evening welcome to the premier investments are viable financial our what's your first name where you calling from\nA bill from Alaska bill was\nA very bills I hated my boss bill would you please\nI certainly will do that I my question is\nWhat are the river [noise] ah I think this has been tossed around forever and I just don't get I get the answers from everybody else and and now what what were they play the river to play in the future of ah [noise]\nOur market for life or our banking system I'll take my answer off the air thank you\nWell I think that bill a great question I think it already played a pivotal role in our history and that was two thousand and eight and that's where a lot of the banks in the insurance companies it's a financial instruments\nOh where people are trying to guess that the what value is going to be derived from whatever I mean and it could be any any financial\nYeah they they basically created a mortgage swaps a brand new financial instruments out of thin air and uh it was based on what the value of mortgage Strauss swaps we're going to be derived at\nUm at our future date 'em and sell derivatives already played a huge role in history obviously at the end up passing the buck\nAround these mortgage swaps and the next person the next person and whoever bought them last uh basically uh the government had to bail out um a couple of insurance companies and and many\nBanks yeah I I I think uh I think they'll probably the easiest way to describe it is it's a financial instrument based on something else\nI mean probably at the at the very rude or the very uh easiest way to describe so for example let's say that ah I'm In this is by no means recommendation at whatsoever right if if I go out and I buy a stock\nI go and purchase and I can actually own that piece of stock well maybe I don't necessarily want to go a purchase that stock maybe I Want to buy the ability to buy or sell that stock sometime in the future\nSo I'm not actually purchasing the stock itself I'm purchasing the option or the ability to buy or sell that that technically is a derivative because I'm not buying or selling what the underlying contractor what the underlying position is I'm I'm I'm\nCreating a a some sort of a contract and creating something that has something as an underlying asset I'm actually on that on that position um\nYou know I mean as far as the banking industry and as a as far as all that and I think especially that's what you were talking about a little bit ...\nUm you know there's a lot of these different instruments where um there's a lot of products that are created by bundling or pre packaging are moving together some different products putting him over into something\nOr maybe they're putting on some leverage maybe they're putting on some time limits a you know they're just creating some sort of a different product that an investor either institutional or retail investor could actually go and put money in\nUm with the goal of a future profit now obviously there is a some different risks they have different risks that are involved in a you know if you're working over in the derivatives markets there's different ... that you're dealing with there if I'm a rather than if you're just buying the buying a straight underlying contract\nA you know there are ways that you can ah virtually create\nAn unlimited a potential for loss of if you're a if you are a utilizing derivatives in the wrong in the wrong sense so I'm\nA unless it's something that you are going to spend some time to really going to understand and know what it is that you're a purchasing and selling or if you're a somebody who's a traitor over on that side of thing understanding the rest of their involved in in buying and selling those um I'd probably very very well caution people against kind of jumping over into those\nUm you know over into those sorts markets or just because there are a lot of\nThere's a lot of underlying dangers that may or may not actually um ... you know that they could or the potential of of something that could actually happen to you know again I I think we go back home you know specifically what you're talking about over in the banking industry\nOr ... again it's it's how do we take these different products that we have these different things that are already existing and how do we create um other ways for people to easily exchange and trading and move this stuff in an out uh in terms of ah their actual asset mix\nSo that really at the end of the day is what it's going to do\nUm they can be good they can be bad I mean again it it completely depends on what you're trying to do inside your portfolio or in the other part of that is uh what's your exactly trying to achieve\nYou know there are some people where they might have a portfolio where ... makes a lot of sense for them if they're looking at some sort of a hedging strategy or something like that\nUm there's a lot of people where maybe they don't necessarily want to
