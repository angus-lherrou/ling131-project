I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they picked up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it\nYou'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes they're legal this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think don't shown to you in the same area you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build the name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that ... top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with\nBob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care\nWell Haley Barbour barred ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh Democrats their National Committee to the one the ... that money needs to find his way into the\nInto these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are outspending us virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly\nIf the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans won the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right in the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... ... years\nHighlights include a

be too busy for doing recovery tend to get out\nWell in Florida early voting is ongoing so that means you can go any time between as I understand it now and election day\nUm I Know it's hard especially for people some people have lost their and everything they lost their entire home they'd been relocated and they don't have a chance to change their voter registration probably so that means that have to go back to where they live in or they can get an absentee ballot I don't think it's too late for that\nEleven days but you'd have to check in with your local elections office\nYes that's correct I saw it on the news the other day about ... still viable\nMainland courage everybody to get out and vote yeah just called\nYour local elections office having to send you an absentee

Frederick Marilyn Donna Hi how are you glad you called eleven days away Hi\nShaun yeah I Can't wait to get out there and vote and I've got several people up in my mind and keep untapped we we have to get out there this is such a a referendum against the socialists and I've got to say and live with the events they\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess suspicious device is because we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe to make sure that that's been confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of chart of glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field\nSaid at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nWell it's a different tack
