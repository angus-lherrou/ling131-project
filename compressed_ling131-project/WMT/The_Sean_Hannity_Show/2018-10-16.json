Fox News as pressure mounts Saudi Arabian officials agree to trying to find out what happened to a journalist who disappeared at the consulate in Turkey\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe at talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well\nHe's now saying and indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nAh he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words\nThat there's been and remains exculpatory evidence it was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges or handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies\nThat was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason Chaffetz is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state\nWe have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of diGenova and Toensing with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk\nIn front of them under oath well the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and and I hope they send you were talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take that said and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh my he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it they say\nThat I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office or Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss than Mr liar and said\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nBetween the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was fat conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us I Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again

V. I. L. GB CQ it's law enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said\nAnd then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nI guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia so I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and\nThat it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema now she's going up against Martha ...

I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're gonna have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ...\nGet to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations own and I met her\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... ...\nYeah but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is his rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leave his kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nWhat I don't need to but what I wouldn't want me to play it again look\nFirst of all you're ignoring them of non violent protests that phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all your your seem to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up and him saying I've got to hurt and if you know I'll get you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened no nothing so sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no if you want me to another question I didn't take that and it's the same intensity and\nMessages arm hearing regularly but this is an every day thing that is now happening with the Democratic party\nAnd by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only play I mean what ... ... you're\nTalking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I miss the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we now learn that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down a secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh\nYeah You're

went anywhere else start six hundred in the U.S so he's a hero ... those are the way that you can get in touch with us here on the program so uh with that why don't we start off with the first listener question from Graham love the name Graham\nIs the two point eight percent cost of living adjustment for Social Security and twenty Nineteen assigned that Social Security is heading in the right direction oh this is\nA fantastic question in that you know again grim really appreciate just sending that into us and\nUh if you've got a question on Social Security or any any other financial topics that are maybe tickle your fancy at any point in time if you just want to hear us talk about ... going down the road a you know for a for a couple of minutes or you as well as grim as like what he did a premier investments about dot com on the contact us button to you\nAre actually submit that but you know I I kind\nOf like this question because you know we do do are seeing an increase in Social Security payments for people or so I I think that Graham has a very good valid question here is is it heading in the right direction well I Would argue payments are yeah you know\nAnybody can get a raise on a fixed budget absolutely weather's thirty nine bucks whether it's sixty bucks what whatever it is a month or every little bit helps\nNow that being said why are we getting this paper is\nAnd that becomes actually the question on why we are a why we're taking a look over on there so a really Graham this this two point eight percent and it's right in there and your question you know it's a cost of living adjustment\nUm so the reality is is a when you look at the basket of goods that the government is so um and actually it's a change CPI index which has changed um you know here just recently in the last tax law I'm the basket of goods that they are measuring is\nMore expensive it's costing more on a living on a a I'm On an annual basis in order to have the same purchasing power\nSo really that's what this cost of living adjustment is designed to do is to make sure that you're able to purchase the same amounts of goods now as you were in the past so really I'm is Social Security heading in the right direction I think payments are\nBut it really doesn't go and talk about the actual stability or the actual system itself it's not really a a I'm a you know the cost\nA living adjustment isn't really a a shining a light on the current funding status it's not a you know the uh the amount of time that we have before the trust fund drives up um you know what the different options are that they can link them that are ... and all that it is just day or it cost of living adjustment or an adjustment due to some inflationary costs\nYeah Matt hitting an important point there you know I think a Graham it it does sound like you're on a fixed income and the the prices of of things like Casey a talked about they have gone up from two point one percent inflation two point five percent\nInflation and that was based on the last kept telling her a letter and uh you know those are those are higher prices Social Security\nAs a whole how that's doing is just a whole nother I think it's a I think it's a whole\nNother radio show or from the from the looks at it from the looks of it um you know really\nThis is because of low interest rates if you look at the eighty three year history of Social Security ah basically it it has a raise dug a Twenty one trillion dollars and that includes address\nThat it's made its paid out Eighteen ... trillion in reserves\nThis is the first time since Nineteen eighty two or that the uh the cost and in twenty eight gene will exceed it's income this year no it's not generating enough interest to uh to pay out the expenses this year and the or the light there's really no light at the end of the tunnel\nAnd they're going to start half this is the year and then next year they're going to have to start dipping into their reserves and that's what Casey was kind of alluding to ah the the main trust fund is expected to be depleted and twenty thirty for\n'em and Medicare's trust fund is even worse that's supposed to be depleted and twenty twenty six and the last time I checked this is twenty Eighteen yeah mhm I mean that's just as a deal is yeah it will last time that far away now and I\nI Will say because we actually run into this quite a bit in the office and in a lot of our conversations I I don't think I'm you know that we are uh you know it is something that we want to keep an eye on we want to you know I I wouldn't necessarily you know say a just weep under the rug we want to pay attention to this was this doesn't necessarily mean that we are a\nPredicting the downfall in the end of Social Security payments um you know and I think that's an important thing 'cause especially when I started talking to somebody or they come into the office I just have all these conversations the other day well what are we looking at as far as Social Security well assuming they don't change anything\nAbsolutely nothing changing the law or anything like that they can still covers Seventy seven percent of the out flows in terms of ah of what's actually going out simply by the current payroll taxes of everything that's coming in\nNow if they did not change anything that doesn't mean a twenty three percent reduction in any payments that are going to ah that would occur in that circumstance once that trust fund goes up now\nRealistically though I don't think it's politically feasible for a politician to allow that to happen and there's some other things maybe that's something that we need to talk about as well some different things that they can ah I'm actually look at doing in order to help a bridge some of this funding gap\nI think one of the things that you've got to understand you know when you talk about Social Security you know it's a contract between you and the U.S government it's backed by the taxpayers of the U.S government is ultimately at the end of the day what's going on with your pension that's a ... that's a contract between\nYou and your employer where you're where your employer is is the one responsible for those payments at annuity they're all because of the same thing it's just who's backing that payment so\nYou know at the end of the day you know where do you think will Congress has the power to tax everybody that's working ... to do that\nWell and I think that right now the maximum is or what is it it was a hundred and Eighteen I think it's a hundred and twenty four or something like that right now because they do some in indexing on inflation so means anybody making more than a hundred and a hundred and whatever it is a hundred and Eighteen hundred and twenty four thousand you're not getting Social Security or or at those taxes over on that now\nObviously if you're making that much you get some additional a Medicare tax you know where to Medicare surcharge that that start to impact you um but that's not as much as the uh the actual Social Security peace because if we look at that you know if you're talking self employment tax along with\nA you know the employee eat portion a you know it's about Fifteen Percent really a that would be going over there to to service so Social Security\n... you know the challenges on Social Security was signed into law in Nineteen thirty five it was voluntary it wasn't until Nineteen forty that it that it became mandatory so when it was signed into law\nYou know the the average male I'm to be fifty three of the average email it to be fifty six benefits started at sixty two and sixty five so it's it's a if you're looking at a totally different set of ... half the people that\nThat that that we're paying into it started in Nineteen forty were not expected to be around so you know the bottom line is is there's a lot of there's a lot of theories on how to solve it the bottom line is is that it's a serious issue and it needs to be addressed\nAnd like you said mad at the end of the day you don't want the your Social Security check the beer only source of income at ...\nUh we're gonna talk later about uh how we uh you know we recommend that it should be maybe half of your retirement income at Monday yeah but the other half needs to come from\nOr other sources dogs so if I'm Fifteen Years away from retirement I better be taking some measures right now or to make sure that uh you know I have some some money squirrels away or rental properties or whatever\nI have an assets that are going to pay me an income to kind of supplement this a Social Security and we talked forever and and on the TV show on channel nine show and and that show about the lack of pensions available for young people\nAre like a map mentioned so those contracts are really gone for the younger people in their forties and fifties nobody in this room has a pension that I'm looking over I'm\nAt I'm
