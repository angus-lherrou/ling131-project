Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote\nAs far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThis was just in the timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture as it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress\nHe shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so bakers\nThis is the biggest abuse of power in history you got to get this doesn't understand how deep this goes will continue on the other side [noise]\n\n\nYou want to\nWin one thousand dollar a thousand bucks every that every now and then they go on vacation and have some others on thousands gift listening for the next year you would have brand new or\nJust listen to win one thousand dollars every hour we have from five AM to nine PM right after the top of the hour an\nBy liberty saves of Cedar Rapids Heather new location forty nine fifty Johnston avenue northwest in Cedar Rapids grand in your hand is on news radio six hundred\nW.

right\nRight and you you don't have\nA car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they cheated that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's\nHow you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this modern last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of doc ah docks were patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... the tabletop his conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like ... what some here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles to access some ... some ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of ... and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because the ...\nOne of the insurance is using insurance drives up the cost of the product so a number I cashed parts for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so you know I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ... topic\nIt be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ...\nIs this state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that's sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and a politician there has in California is to send them an originality just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it\nSo patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable I'm actually looking at ways that are fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending and if I could\nAdd up to the system of you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nOr so something little stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plan it was called ... short term medical plans and some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we\nDo the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida huh hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've

M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nNear ... storm to hit Florida in a quarter century ... Fox News the worst of hurricane Michael has already passed Florida governor Rick Scott warned knock it out on the roads until\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect to that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\n... over a million power outages we expected occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved in thinking how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third Pfizer Britain knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money\nIt was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense now\nHe was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting\nRod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McCain Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment either he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just saying things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in ... when the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially at five application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony Ducey eight that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first it gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there are there\nBut anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ... especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she was really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana\nPossible equal housing wizard liberate\nUs silly little where you'll get coverage in the middle of anywhere I always have ruled\nBy Windsor windows\nKilling was ... years old boys the little guys we do [noise]\nGood evening everybody thanks so much for tuna to others said it was your ... what is your name was ... was Carlos are Kelly [noise]\nI'm a south east side of Iowa City or the rain has has finally so used to at least in most places anywhere or anywhere out Iowa okay football reaches the midway point of this season this weekend that's hard to believe a road trip to Indiana games six shot at twelve eleven AM kick\nDot o'clock breakfast pre game here Tomahawk radio network Iowa appointed Minnesota\nForty eight thirty one Saturday in Minneapolis scoring a twenty eight first ... points behind quarterback dates and families four touchdown passes or Nathan has really been a fire or the last few weeks\nBefore touchdown strikes give him nine for this season\nOr just for interceptions east completing a sixty two percent [noise] a rage at his third street game better than three hundred passing yards [noise]\nThe guys average almost fourteen years for completion against Minnesota so\nOver the course loaded up against the Hawkeye running game they had seven eight defenders\nOf the line of scrimmage in the box most of the day so the ... only average to point seven yards per carry but they did reach one hundred six yards for the day so you cannot abandon the run you got to stay with the run you got to show a\nMental fully hit a couple of big ones that not only sets up the passing game even better [noise]\nUh defensively what can we say well we seemed seemingly we say Anthony Nelson every week he was in the lead again three ... three tackles for laws Iowa had five total ... and for interception ... three of those by first time first time starters about a\nFreshman quarterbacks Riley Bosch and uh uh Julius branch boy were they spectacular as the day wore on a Julius ah pretty much had his guy gobbled up all day long\nAnd they weren't going after Riley cost a much nearer to to though before the day was over and Brent to grab the one\nThat's thrown into the fire a following injuries to OSHA moody at Hankins both were out of there is a good chance that does your Modi in Hankins can be back this week playing course coach will give us an update on\nGuys that were hoping to see if not a a sooner certainly later a line backers jak pack a day\nAnd a nickname and\nLooks like they're going to miss this week\nAnd ah maybe another week\nOr both have had a ... issues to deal with a\nA jacket I heard a need here the past week and it looks like he's going to be out at least one maybe two games they hope to have ... out the by week and then of course last Saturday but hopefully they can get back to the ... already inexperienced at that position as everybody knows\nComing into the season can ill afford to have a guy's missing time for any length and then of course somebody Jones or if you haven't heard was called for targeting\nLate in the game at Minnesota uh it was reviewed it was a failed so a ... a middle linebacker is going to miss\nThe first half of the game this Saturday at Indiana and and that is critical because the Hoosiers loved to throw it all over the field that they've been running the ball better but the ... are facing a\nA quite a quite a pastor in this uh Peyton Ramsey\nHe can really uh throw the football you know we'll talk about his numbers\nAs the evening wears on a bus with the past rush hopefully they can harassed the un sophomore out of Cincinnati collapsed the pocket get them to make a decision sooner than he had like an a and put the ball up but that Indiana office is far from one dimensional with fresh material back goes deeply Scott\nThis kid has a a true freshman\nOut of Syracuse and to try these numbers on a six foot two two hundred and thirty five pounds a true freshmen\nAnd he's already rush for five hundred and thirty yards averages five yards to carry\nA with a logging forty five he's got for touchdowns he's caught eight passes\nSo the Indiana's not a one dimensional like they have been off and on for a lot of years and just throw throw throw out of that spread Stevie Scott is the real deal but hopefully the hawk as given as you can get them to put the ball on the ground a time or two at Iowa defense has been a solid\nThroughout the season and hopefully they can be solid again this Saturday it all need to be because this is one of the better officers that they'll face it's a very creative\nVery a wide open a and it's it's typical Indiana they've got quality receivers uh Ramsey has thrown a eleven touchdown passes to seven different guys so he he will spread it around his throat for Thirteen hundred yards completing passes at a sixty seven\nSo he had Nathan Stanley I have very similar numbers very very good quarterback so that's where we'll start tonight when we focus on Iowa and Indiana the Hoosiers are foreign to\nBoth of their losses have come in Big Ten play\nWild hog guys sit there for and won inclusive of a by week Iowa is one and one of the capital shoving laws to up\nTo a Wisconsin on opening day and that of course knocking off the gophers last week of the ... right out too quickly which was good fourteen to nothing\nStanley was intercepted right before halftime of course which gave Minnesota an easy touchdown and they were able to close the gap to eleven by half time and then of course the other big turnover for Iowa even though they want the turnover battle for to to a Stanley ... or was the victim of a strip humble [noise]\nDeep in his own territory or recovered at\nThe ten and run back to the three were Minnesota had at the end zone and that that got to go first to within one touchdown midway through that third periods where things were a little dicey\nAt that moment but then came the swinging gate the fake field goal of the touchdown and a couple of ... field goals and a couple of more Iowa touchdowns and they're able to put pulled away for a forty eight to thirty one victory over Minnesota\nSo that was that Indiana those years before the hawks come home for homecoming and the University of Maryland a week from Saturday but we'll talk about that appropriately and up\nNext week for tonight where Carlos so Kelly's as we always are the twentieth anniversary twentieth season of hock talk here at Carlos
