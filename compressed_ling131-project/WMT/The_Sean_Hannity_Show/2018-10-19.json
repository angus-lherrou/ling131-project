information was used to obtain the price of warrants against Carter Page you can't make any of this up for people now saying Rod Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification of let's see three oh twos gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nA we're also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages ten through twelve seventeenth ... thirty four remember the bulk of information for the size of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated Russian dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven or John Solomon out with an article yesterday in his article what he's talking about all these FBI top the oj officials\nThere on all the special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann they went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years and the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals but sounds complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal\nIn the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly fit the deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled than they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it just it getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting ...\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government and hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I\nI think we're getting into that if you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nThey bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are\nInstigating the investigators they have been obstructed\nEvery step of the way request document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turned out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nWhen Simpson is pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear in testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe in one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits in the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example\nOf how very wrong things have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good last words as vital Congress to no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this\nNinety nine page report on Pfizer court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts an agenda by law enforcement officers to invade the law there is by the way one author or as you that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that just above the five to ... it will also under their rule for consider procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice appointed right now that I just ran us and telling talent for different circuits maybe ... maybe that court should be the subject\nOf the uh the ... the forum for a motion to review what's going on to fight the court also just remembering you have in the ... court efforts\nBy later where are these buys a court judges\nA fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the court and these judges other quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out anytime the most sensitive area of our government probably because it's an ex part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nYou know you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival start with you to get your reaction considering you\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know chink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about\nThey use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies in the federal government Solomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the D.
