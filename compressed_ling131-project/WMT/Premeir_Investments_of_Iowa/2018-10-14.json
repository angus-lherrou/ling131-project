P. Morgan that they were talking about that\nUm [noise] that um most people one of the significant reasons that people actually retire it's not because they want to\nIt's because they have to for health reasons or they just can't physically continue to go and do the daily grind that they were doing a for so many years um you know oftentimes especially in a manufacturing in construction and then a lot of these industries we see that a very very typical where somebody can't maintain that same pace is what they used to\nOr even health insurance Casey I mean that's the big reason that people are a majority of people can't retire before their age sixty five and eligible dug for Medicare um is a health insurance premiums are they\nThey just can't afford or the health insurance premiums outside of their employer so they're almost forced to work out we call it the gap at our office or a folks that are a five to ten years maybe away from retirement now James or the listener and you might have a\nUm some group health insurance that he could take with him at retirement or because if you have to go off of your group plan and buy it on the outside then you're looking at premiums on average of over a thousand dollars a month and a lot of people say well there's no way I can afford that so they continue it at least have one spouse continue to work until age ... your\nHere's a question for you though um especially on his group health plans that allow you to continue your benefits would you say that that is the norm or is that the exception it depends\nI borrow the line from you know I left Iraq actually arrived no and you know I Would say that you know really oftentimes and we're looking at those health plans that are that continuation of benefits usually is more the exception to the rule more often when you leave that employer you're not going to be able to continue those health benefits um you know in the exact same way that that what they currently are now obviously there's\nA quite a few employers that do allow you to continue to do that\nUm you know but uh not every single one is actually going to allow\nThat as well and you know obviously James that debt as talked about on financial shows all the time but you know James has to a\nUm have his debt under control you know especially five to ten years away from retirement you know I always like to ask you know what what's your biased towards car payments and and house payments when you're that close to retirement\nYou know if if you have a lot of car payments and you have a lot of house payments when we're doing a financial plan plan we need to uh uh we need to put those in the plant and they're they are\nThey are a part of your financial planning that and that\nBasically counts against you or for doing a financial plan So Doug if you have a lot of car payments and you have a house payment that's an accounting and writer financial plan and the probability of money that money lasting\nA your retirement you're going to come out with a call at a worse grade than somebody that uh hasn't had a car payment for a five or ten years and is going to have the mortgage paid off you know some time before\nA retirement and I think that that that is a big he also\nWell maybe maybe maybe not um you know I I think a big piece of that goes on there and actually it does include the the house payments but you're talking more over on the cash side you know if you required additional cash flow\nUm you know let's let's say for example or you have to individuals have the same level of assets that you know basically everything is identical except for the amount of money that they're trying to pull from a portfolio word that they need to retire on\nYou know one of them have additional car payments they've got mortgage payments they've got all that so uh they're spending two thousand dollars a month plus all these car payments\nOr it is a higher probability or higher likelihood that that money is going to run out\nBefore the person that is not paying for those additional things out of pocket and I think that's kind of what you're getting ... ... talking about Iran that outlay unless they have that much more say though I had to say that worried her of a bench but again this goes back to your relationship with money right because if you have somebody who are exactly the same let's say the one person has the payments they have the car payments but they're only taken\nTwo thousand dollars out of their portfolio let's say they got a million dollar portfolio they're only taking two thousand dollars a month after tax out of that\nAnd then you've got somebody else in the exact same situation the same assets same everything but they are pulling out Fifteen thousand dollars in rent\nYou know that person is drawing that Fifteen thousand dollars is going to obviously chew through that portfolio faster or so maybe the maybe the actual debt portion um you know while it does impact or cash fluids that total amount of cash flow that you're trying to draw from your portfolio between cause that drag and that caused some of your issues over in the future\nThree six five zero six hundred eight hundred three three to five words you're went anywhere else star successor to the U.S all you hear line phone numbers to get in touch with Casey and joined us from your investments a viable financial program so uh there was a second question that was out there as well yeah we\nDid actually I'm Sarah had a citizen an email as well and that we appreciate that Sarah she says I Am thirty one and my parents keep telling me to get life insurance I don't have any debt a mortgage or dependence do I really need insurance and of\nCourse on the investment guy and I'm not the insurance guy so I Would say no you don't need insurance I Would just put your parents down as beneficiaries on your airmen land definitely take out a your retirement plan I Would I Would say at thirty one if you don't I Would challenge Sarah if she doesn't have\nAny debt she doesn't have a mortgage or dependence please please\nSave like crazy right now ... ah because you may have a debt you may have that you may have a mortgage and you may have dependence so a yell at and max out that four O. one K. tried to start a Roth IRA if you're eligible look at a non retirement account just save as much as you possibly can right now thirty one\nWell you know and I hope I'm Sorry go ahead I'll pick up after you know I you know I I think that there's a couple of other things we have to take in consideration I mean I understand where they're coming from um you know when you're young health insurance especially if you're looking at a term policy is incredibly inexpensive\nOkay um you know on a thirty one year old who is healthy you can pick up a term policy and it's it's very very inexpensive\nI'm One of the things we might want to you or that you kind of alluded to the owner says she might if she has plans have dependents in the future you know this is somebody who may come into our office and they say to me one thirty one I have absolutely zero intention of ever becoming married I'm never going to have children\nThen there may not necessarily be a true need for any life insurance or might not need to be a need in order to save that ensure ability right um the problem is she has right now she's young and healthy she can get health insurance if something were to happen to her where she now becomes ineligible where she'd be a candle longer pickup insurance in the future\nIs definitely a concern and that's something that is a you know possibly that her parents are taking a look at over on there or if she's planning on having some independence later on she might want to make sure that she has the ability to get some insurance later on down the line\nI'm now again that becomes a conversation around the different types of insurance\nDoes she need a you know a a sixty five or wife policy\nProbably not I would probably argue against that maybe having some sort of a term wasn't conversion privileges or something like that and there might be appropriate\nUm something she doesn't mentioned in here is she married\nIf she's a you know she doesn't have dependence what does she actually married is her spouse to she was so are the primary breadwinner and the family if that's the case what happens to the spouse if something were to happen to her um you know and these are the kind of the conversations that you need to start having when you're looking at a um held a life
