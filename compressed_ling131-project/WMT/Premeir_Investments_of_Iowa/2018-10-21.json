ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement\nThat's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to sand or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute

was killed yesterday in Greenwich county\nWe had officers or go out [laughter] vehicle Shiloh when they approach the shopping by her side of the of the best shot\nWhen a county police sergeant Jake Smith police believe Eighteen year old sorry Maynard Melville fired the shots I second peanuts and arrest for aggravated assault related to a separate incident after the shooting in South Carolina I'm more than two dozen people or heard after a floor collapsed overnight giving a party inside a club\nNow if they did not change anything that does mean a twenty three percent reduction in any payments that are going to ah that would occur in that circumstance once that trust one goes up now realistically though I don't think it's politically feasible\nFor a politician to allow that to happen and there's some other things and maybe that's something that we need to talk about as well some different things that they can actually look at doing in order to help a bridge some of this funding yeah\nI think one of the things that you've got to understand you know when you talk about Social Security you know it's a contract between you and the U.S government it's backed by the taxpayers of the U.S government is ultimately\nThe at the end of the day what's going on here with your pension that's a ... that's a contract between you and your employer where you're where your employer is is the one responsible for those payments an annuity they're all because of the same thing it's just who's backing that payment so\nYou know at the end of the day you know where where do you think will Congress has the power to tax everybody that's working ... to do that\nWell and I think that right now the maximum is or what is it it was a hundred and Eighteen I think it's a hundred and twenty four or something like that right now because they do some in indexing on inflation so that means anybody making more than a hundred and a hundred and whatever it is a hundred and Eighteen hundred and twenty four thousand you're not getting Social Security or or or those taxes over on that now\nObviously if you're making that much you get some additional a Medicare tax you know to a Medicare surcharge that that start to impact you um but that's not as much as the or the actual Social Security peace because if we look at that you know if you're talking self employment tax along with\nA you know the employee eat portion a you know it's about Fifteen Percent really a that would be going over there to\nTo service so Social Security but you know the challenge is is when Social Security was signed into\nLaw in Nineteen thirty five it was voluntary it wasn't until Nineteen forty that it that it became mandatory so when it was signed into law you know the the average male I'm to be fifty three the average email it to be fifty six benefits started at sixty two and sixty five\nSo it's it's a if you're looking at a totally different set of ... half the people that\nThat that that we're paying into it started in Nineteen forty we are not expected to be around so you know the bottom line is is there's a lot of there's a lot of theories on how to solve it the bottom line is is it's it's a serious issue and it needs to be addressed\nAnd like you said mad at the end of the day you don't want the your Social Security check that we're only source of income at a time and\nUh we're gonna talk later about uh how we uh you know we recommend that it should be maybe half\nOf your retirement income at ... yeah but the other half a needs to come from other sources dogs so if I'm Fifteen Years away from retirement I I better be taking some measures right now\nOr to make sure that uh you know I have some some money squirrels away or rental properties or whatever I have an assets\nThat are going to pay me an income to kind of supplement this a Social Security\nAnd we talked forever and and on the TV\nA show on channel nine show and and this show about the lack\nOf pensions available for young people are like a mat mentioned so those contracts are really gone for the younger people in their forties and fifties nobody in this room has a pension that I'm looking over I'm at I'm looking at look at all or you know I should look it over a case you know pensions here so\nUm it's up to you to provide that says ... money that provides an income for your retirement

them a phone call came calls the three six three three and one on there and welcome back to the premier investments survival financial program you've got Casey mush Russia Jonah severed and Matt Westbury\nIn Studio and uh they're ready to talk to you they're ready to listen to any questions you have maybe some thoughts that you have as well [noise]\nHere on the program I'm In addition to the listener question there's also the number of things that we talked about on a regular basis that are just one of those sort of common sense things that\nA lot of people maybe they just do not thinking about because they've got so much on their plate\nA including things like different rules to live by I mean you've got the bucket strategy that you use you got some of the more the common rules to to live buys like you know in in in order to you mean you can't take it with used one of them but we're talking today about four different retirement rules that you need to live\nBy but yeah the number one as a assume that you're spending won't go down a in a retirement you know we've talked at length about the health care costs are in a retirement so um you know I\nThink that the the first step that uh that we have people do is we really want them to take an inventory of what they've accomplished accomplished so far so the second question we asked new people is really what do you think you've done really well\nI'm up to this point and uh what's your number one financial\nStrength and we tried to build a off of that and ah that said it's very important because uh that we would talk to another shows about everybody has a different relationship with money and last time I checked the money's pretty emotional\n[laughter] yeah it is not whether it's an emotional topic whether in Langley earlier married actually if you're married really that's what I mean that's one of the big thing so if we go into the first part of the plan saying that uh it's difficult to build planned yourself because you have to have this income coming in\nWhere he talked about the prices of things going up on a fixed income so we have to have the supercomputer\nActually illustrate that you're getting paid out higher pay check each year and like like Matt mentioned you're not you're not a dying at age fifty three or fifty six anymore you're actually making it [noise] I'm Andy or eighties nineties and and sometimes that even more so\nUm yeah that's number one assume you're going to spend a you're spending won't go down it's actually going to go up I'm In a retirement maybe not right away and retirement but a lot of folks in their eighties and our financial plan\nEstimates that eighty five eighty four eighty five is the number one claim age for assisted living facilities in nursing homes so you're gonna have that rainy day your income is going to go up or in retirement somewhere so just plan on that so what do you think number two is cases or\nNo I I I'm actually kind of go back over there um where you're talking about over on that spending because you actually brought up a really good point when we're starting on this conversation about longevity\nRight um you know the reality of a thirty year retirement is it's here\nYou know I I Know that you were sitting there talking about how we're running these estimates out where maybe we're planning making a planning age age Ninety three um for a married uh for a a married couple a that comes in at age sixty five\nAh you know if we see for if we see two couples so there's four of them to come in there is a Ninety percent chance at one of those poor people is going to hit eighty Ninety\nNow obviously we don't know which one is going to be\nBut it's statistically it we are very likely to be seen each one of those people for another twenty five years if not longer than that so uh you know I I think that it's very important that you bring that up um and obviously even that goes back to our conversation we have with Graham\nUm where we are talking about the cost of living what's driving the cost of living it's the fact that the uh the fact that these goods and services that you are purchasing are going to naturally increase in price over time because ...\nSo we want to make sure that we factor that over into so whether or not you assume that you're spending let's say that uh we walk into it and say well we're going to just go eighty five percent of my current income as my spending go um you do have to factor in that that will be increasing uh at some point in time and that some certain rate in the future\nYeah we talked about you know the three stages retirement you know is the the go go is the first stage where everything's new and exciting ... it's a Saturday\nI I think we talk about you know that that stage and that's the most uh spending of you're disposable income you know where you're spending it on activities and projects and\nYou know people think just because they stay home and they're not they're not checking those those those making those check marks on their bucket list that when they go into the no go stage when they don't take as many trips that they don't go see as many you know football and volleyball and band concerts for the grandkids that that their money is going to go down and then in the no go that\nHey I don't leave my I don't leave my lazy boy I don't leave my recliner except to go [noise]\nMaybe to the doctor to pick up my prescriptions or meet with my financial advisor right Casey now but but the challenge is is is the does the spending go down or is he in the spending just redirected to different things because the cost you know", "show_name": "Premeir Investments of Iowa", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "21"}
