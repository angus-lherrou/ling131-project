we've got [noise] Jeff Johnston studio with you and uh we've got your phone calls we also have a question from Daryl a listener who said with the recent involving\nChill the tea in the market or around Wall Street Joe ... is there anything to be concerned about or any changes we should be making two investment strategy I\nI Would just say I know you want to throw some and joined us here but I guess this one point is if\nThe alternative to sitting still and waiting is timing the market you have to think of it this way you have to be right twice when your time the market\nYou have to be right when he's selling you have to be right when you buy because when you sell you have to put the proceeds somewhere eventually right so you have to be right twice and you can be right\nNine eight eight nine times out of ten the one time you're wrong and it happens to be overweight or one yeah in ... all the times that you're right and that's why we're recommending for most people listening right now\nTo not be in the market of actively trading for their retirement now you can trade in a portfolio of investments that you can afford to lose it all there is no that I have a lot of people I meet that is kinda fun money\nHey and only got a couple of million dollars in my vestments I Want to put twenty grand in a brokerage account just by some funds stocks and there's no harm in that that's that's like the senior citizens it go down to the casinos and they lose fifty bucks and for them it's like fifty thousand it's no big deal yeah I think people can manage that effectively I'm\nWhen I hear people say well retirees shouldn't go to casinos I if you can do it responsibly right why shouldn't you be able to do that\n... that just that's one of your entertainment alternative it'll different news or do you just said you manage\nIt well there is the people that can't do that and the people that turned trading into gambling and then they they they lose their retirement over that and those are the people that were trying to to get to not fall into this trap\nSo you I I kind of say you're either in or you're not there is no well I'm I'm In the market today and tomorrow I don't want to be an tomorrow I Want to be in I don't want to be an today right that's an unhealthy relationship with money and it'll be very very stressful as you get older\nYeah they don't it always depends Jeff on what investments are barrels in and this is a stage in life but I Would ask a\nUh Darryl ... question I Would ask Darryl another question a basically a\nUm he's asking if you should make any changes because of the volatility in the stock market I Would ask him at at this stage of the game right now Darryl\nWhat's most important to you about your money and um because that's the most important thing and then the second question I Would ask there'll is what's your biggest concern about your money\nUh because uh you know I Know from doing this twenty five years\nThat for investors losses heard a couple of times more than any gains seemed to help and what I mean by that dog is a\nReally if we started having some consistent losses people are investors are going to grow new head\nRight and that's just you just don't know who it is we're all we're all fully invested in this thing we're all in the same boat boat together um none of us are like Warren Buffett that have a hundred billion dollars on the sidelines waiting for Ford Motor company they say that I was ... this\nYear I was watching the sports a story and they were talking about\nSome of the best competitors and history all time you know Tiger Woods Jack Nicholas um you know all the the the football players and they have a belief that the joy of winning is not as as strong as the pain of losing in other words losing is such a powerful motivator to them when they when\nThey compartmentalize that very quickly Israeli wand and moving on but when they lose it\nBurns them in science and and I and that's the same with losses people will look at their investments and open their statement is the one up and this has great I made made money blah blah and then the first time they get one last they're like wow\nIt went down and we're not going to do you know and and they they just affects more motion to the losses and we're just trying to get people to understand that if this is\nAs you say long term we don't want our emotions to be in the short term exactly you want your emotions in the long term and that's really difficult because you're dead you're playing like forty chess at that well what's difficult dog is it the Internet's made it completely ridiculous to watch your investments like it's a horse race oh yeah\nAnd so you got someone who's Thirty years old is not retiring dealer fifty two and\nThey're checking their four one K. every day for what purpose and other than self inflicting pain exactly there's no benefit and doing that absolutely zero\nAnd people really lose track a of a what I call discounting their blessings ... they they they they forget about doing an inventory of what they've done well financially up to this point and they look at their statement when they started having losses and it kinda backfires on them the frequency of that\nYou check a your account balances you should be checking the uh you should be doing an inventory of your financial strengths are well before you check your your statement I actually if you know if you if you if you're if you're hearing your co workers say that they're losing money before you check your statement\nDo an inventory of all the financial strengths that you've\nAccomplished up to this point and then using and then you jak your account balance\nSorry Jeff for it I was gonna say [laughter] I had a really good point widowed shown as soon as the\nMiddle but that that that's one of those things where uh when when people see what happened today you know I got off the air I Walk back into the newsroom Dow is down five hundred and forty and everybody's running around with their hair on fire and like I remember ...\nKicked in I just remember what I what I Believe when if you know it's like when we have people that are twenty five thirty five forty five even fifty years old\nAnd they're looking at their four one K. statement you know on line or looking at their IRA with their investment company on line okay I encourage them to really only look at one thing when they look at that statement\n... and that's the number of shares that you won't\nBecause that's that's what you're trying to do you're trying to accumulate like monopoly you're trying to accumulate as many shares a you pop all possibly can\nSo at the point in time down the road that you need them and they're worth more than what you paid right so what they're worth at aged forty five or forty or thirty five ...", "show_name": "Premeir Investments of Iowa", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "28"}
