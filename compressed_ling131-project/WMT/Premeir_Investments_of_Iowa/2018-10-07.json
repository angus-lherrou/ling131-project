financial program with Casey mush rushed Jonah Sanford and Matt Westbury and uh your phone calls your question [noise] ah we did have a call from bill and we were in the midst of answering a question from Rick ... center point\nHe was said I'm thinking retiring earlier than expected my five to seven years is there anything that I should be thinking about\nYeah you know and and I know you guys were kind of a um had talked about the financial aspect of things are a quite a bit before we were getting back and I know Jonah shoot him on this a little bit but you know the immediate thing that I thought of is\nWhy I Hope you have some good hobbies that you enjoy right because there's only so many times you can run out to the Gulf War a golf course there's only so many times you can go out and eat and have a nice as I sit down dinner I'm you on that first couple of\nWeeks like your your hobby Casey is it's a shooting guns and a ... expensive\nAnd that's right you know you got to account for that and you got to buy in bulk though you gotta fight that all that's how you get around that one um but I just get it from mom and dad\nYeah [laughter] um\nBut you know that's kind of one of those things that you want to make sure that you have some sort of a hobby or if you have some sort of a um\nA is something that you can do it's going to replace that time you know sitting in front of the couch and and watching TV yeah I I I don't know that that's\nNecessarily the way that you know if you look at the way that we're built as humans I don't think that's that's what we all are really meant to do I mean do you need some sort of mental stimulation you need some sort of social\nInteraction is kind of like on vacation how many days can you sit down before you think like I got to go do something that well here's kind of a neat less guys and we go over this\nThe first half of our ah um educational class that uh that we put on at the junior college here um some uh some uh ideas for Iraq if he can't find anything to do start a nonprofit\nAre joined the effort to promote a cause any cause that you believe in um he may have believed in something the whole time and have it he hadn't had the time to ah the joined the cars run for a local office although\nFor Iraq I'll write your name [laughter] I don't know the average voter fraud or a [laughter] you're you're in the pool and our ... for a look just as good I don't believe they're going to accept Rick from cedar now it was cedar point that a write in candidate art at new enterprise\nRescue dogs I Know a Doug you're uh you're very you're a big believer and and a pet rescued oh actually talk about that all that in a building ... uh for the homeless um and things that things of that nature and uh\nSo uh yeah I Wish you luck I think that if you if you do retire early um\nI Know from experience doing the twenty five years my customers that have retired I really only had one come back\nAfter twenty five years and say that I'm bored the other three hundred and fifty or so or however many uh uh collectively uh they're just doing the things that they want to do instead of the things that they had that yeah they're busy\nDoing the things that they wanted to do that they never had time for it it's the hardest to to schedule\nA a review with people that are actually enjoying their retirement yeah because it's kids baseball games are scattered in with golfing and camping and hunting and you know may maybe day trips I mean it it's ... some ... some people it's really really really hard to get a\nGet a hold of them and it's not like things are really really expensive but\nYou know go go into kids' baseball game a lot of times you know\nYou always see client's fate that that they're going to their kids basketball games and they they have five or six grandkids and they're getting to the age where they're they're playing sports are there in band or\nOr you know they become grandma and grandpa taxi service ... just to help the kids out so\nAnd a real quick a wreck or financially we're talking about wreck the that's looking at retiring and five I'm expected or to retire five to seven years early ... ah from center point here I'm One of the things that you have to look at when it back to the uh investment back to your portfolio\nYou really have to be diversified it's a lot trickier now than ever before to try to get income off a portfolio so um you know we go back and forth or\nOn this the different advisors that Vermeer investments of Iowa I'm at the office I actually I lean on a a professor from the um University of Chicago Booth school a Nobel Prize winner ah Richard Thaler and or you know tax them every once in a while and he's able to\nAre said to give me a really good explanation of you know I've flat out ask them what's a what's a what's a great piece of advice you can get people that are retiring and he basically said that uh you know you only have one chance to save for retirement I think we all know that\nAre about really a professor at Baylor said what an investor needs to know is how a choice between funds affects his or her spending power during retirement under various scenarios\nUm and I think that that's ... that's kind of brilliant because we're talking about not only spending power now and we're talking about spending power in the future and we're also talking about different periods of time different markets different interest rates different periods of inflation I'm so that that that that uh\nThat kind of a run mines me of what we do what the what the financial plan I Would really like ... that go in and try to get a some type of a a a a data print out on what\nSome of the sounds like you're talking about renting a thousand different trials\n[laughter] return [laughter]\nNice\nAnother thing I think that it's important to do which are they think you've talked about um quite a bit before is\nMaking sure you're taking care of yourself as well [noise] why I think we all know far too many times where somebody's retired and then within months if not a couple of years they're gone for whatever reason but I mean if you have good health to begin with\nKeep it healthy if you don't have good health take this opportunity to work on your own self ... because you've got the time and you've got the ability and really the least expensive thing that you can do is go for a walk [laughter]\nI mean really all it causes your time at that point you're paying yourself anyway so make sure you're staying healthy so you can enjoy that I mean I think I even saw that on a sign\nDriving by the premier investments of Iowa officer over there the other side of the talks about specifically that whole idea you've saved all this time to make sure you enjoy it right\nYeah it's your retirement now enjoy it you know it's kind of one of those tag lines that uh\nUm yeah I think that was from several years ago and and I I think we still use that I'm a little bit on some things that we do but you know in in I I actually I think that's a fantastic way of looking at retirement\nRight and this is the same thing that Rick I'm you know kind of what we're talking about with you\nUm when you're walking into this retirements ... um you know and again let's let's go ahead and assume that the money piece of it's already taken care of that you've gone through the the planning process and that you have a very high level of financial confidence is you're going to be able to do the things that you want to do", "year": "2018",
