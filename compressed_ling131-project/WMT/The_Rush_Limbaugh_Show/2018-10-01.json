investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last she's not the least credible witness it all of this and yet there\nIs automatically\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened\nAll those years ago you can see yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend Harvard or Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both verbally bubble if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent or fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who fought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question\nIf the FBI after a wink agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is Justin Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWe showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're going to have to show up and many germs are ...\nGoing to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats are motivated Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\n\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they could get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the plural evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow look you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive by media that's why\nIt's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican\nDoom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media\nRush Limbaugh's those Republicans guaranteed to lose ... capital not confirmed\nThat production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and set it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want\nTo Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make a case here is one more\nA bite on this this uh CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAndrew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think this whole situation that's really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea is\nIf the liquid isn't shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your free quote called eight hundred five seven three
