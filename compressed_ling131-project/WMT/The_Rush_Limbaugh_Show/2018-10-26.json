everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have\nBlown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this and everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy identifying\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we have the GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock\nSector is taking a bath specifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting today\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light a\nHeadline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I've thought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics\nVery unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat's his tweets\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nAnd if there isn't any knows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bombs thing has come along\nI mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic\nIn the poll Ron Santa's has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal and\nSo ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does\nAffect what people think their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nFact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat\nNonsensical suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nIs tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent through Cory Booker and James Clapper what Trump's tweet well someone nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs are Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to do to cover up any news or anything good maybe have a favorable the Republicans at Trump from being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this and it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating to try to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learned things that I can personally confirming vouch for\nAnd what have no trouble explaining if somebody question about that I'll pass subtlety let's take a brief time out we will

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except the theory is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\n... I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see an or find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless\nLay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them damn attempt to do with you and the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make a ... I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody\nElse while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nIn dress up a van that says notice me and if you want to everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened\nA meeting black Leadership Conference a young black\nLeaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner\nUh [noise] and he's talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody [laughter]\n\nJob by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events\nThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not as on the\nPoint is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... foreign showed up\nAt the at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she can testify I think you know what happened or happened and Kevin are maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it gets himself on record just being proper in the proper way to look at it\nHe was very gracious toward the work done to bring this vile this gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice and I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider\nHim a total fraud that he's calling for unity you might\nYou might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox in a call trumpet total front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and division\nThey will say that Trump was on believe oblique brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit\nThey'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it remember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as on involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the ... the around the Obama effect

marveled at this and how how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nAnd all those lies about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing never called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's acknowledging law enforcement\nAnd they're going to call him a total fraud here by trying to say he's for unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this as if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words

hundred percent right so you're a hundred percent right like it looks too good it's been out there in the sun for as long as it has been people in that state openly can despise the president and probably have a long time and nothing's happened to this guy then it's like\nSomebody just toss this guy the keys and tell them hang out for twenty minutes the cops will be here you know and then you just take it from there it's like how much more to set up in this book like this they even if this guy was part of the Republican Party\nThe guy needs help and he doesn't represent anything but a

see people would notice of and I noticed a bumper sticker on a car in front of me if I think it's looney tunes\nDoes this this man or\nThere's no way that this man doesn't get noticed in doesn't have

him up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet\nAnd we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite all of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what has\nBeen done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so\nCalled foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign you never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was hounding proper or your advisors who is obviously goes out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's email\nWell I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nIs stepping up just you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what\nPapadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigations they'll get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out\nAnd the fastest way to making sure that nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool\nThe cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wedding and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it\nIs true I'm not I have no doubts about it I Believe those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush
