M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station\nIn a synagogue massacre appears in court I mean the Brady functioning is the first appearance for Robert Bauer is he just got out of the hospital this morning\nBecause what it shows is that whenever there is any kind of violence\nAny kind of uprising any kind of ... the first instinct of the drive by media has\n\nAnd I when I drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that's supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I Walk out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and it no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory just said a Republican\nWe're going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that\nIs why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do\nAnd then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person\nThat we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not think of somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about\nThat except to the extent they can link the Trump well I've I for one am am fed up with it I'm sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or\nTrump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we end up being responsible for deaths in print only go\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise]\nAnd you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it it is like your man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend to ratchet these two things\nUp to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops back during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they want to condemn there weren't any\nConsequences for that protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and it literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that ... what the Mike Brown ... first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... whatever they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now is because it is\nNobody believes what'd you say\nNobody trusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it so obviously you're you're\nPassionate about this is what you can deal with it politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is the guy that shot this place up Hey David Donald Trump Donald Trump was too big a Jewish supporter his daughter\nConverted to Judaism before marrying questioner he mourned the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming Trump is saying well a lot of that that Iraq and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that that that they just did that the cover up Trump's real anti Semitism\nDonald Trump's maybe one of the best friend is Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the\nCase of was that it's it's a David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers\nThey're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch in his lab Julia donated funny the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's locked away except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white privilege racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see it\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as\nIll motivated why does somebody think that way what\nWhat make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media\nI submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school were not even a legitimate acts of charity work compassion\nAre allowed because they're not real their relief from racists bigots who are\nTrying to mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted and

we've got and Kavanaugh is supposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised is to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people are

and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things to happen before they realized it more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with the gun that can stop this is\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of death\nThere's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech accept\nYou can't say this you can't say that kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftist [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're

had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd then on to tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as

racial politics\nBut it's if I had the religion airtime but religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think he can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with a disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform of orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it\nBut yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian to do um I don't\nThem as necessarily being Sunni Islam but I you know\nIt's the it's the right guy this that's exactly right and\nI assist wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if\nThere's no ultimate power that can meet out approval to disapprove of ... than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given\nEverything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this event in Pittsburgh than it did it\nAdds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nAnd I I I don't\nFeel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nI'd choose in a way that they would Monica she'd have to bring it on I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because the country it's so good that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish\nI and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that I Am\nGlad you because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm\nRemember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about that\n[noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different which is why I did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has this happens to these two events come along and they ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the\nPresident when he was going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes ... says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponents Congress writes the laws but the idea\nThat Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House that's how they want to use it that's what its purpose is\nWe can't wait to have the best fans of the country

up\nAcross social media speech an anti Semitism are rampant and on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the center and unapologetically incendiary president I'm traveling by traditional norms of civility\nTraditional norms of civility they do another Trump is a reactionary he's reacting to the way they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlame to go around on both sides here but for the media just totally claim they've got nothing to do with this\nIs absurd now here's map you doubt this guy formally and George W. Bush Republican\nNow he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to read us a much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Matt ...\nOh yes he says oh Trump's false all of this is Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but\nThey don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time teams in Congress to me here when they when they get called out on this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search\nWho a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and they're married Jordan the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nAnd he also has a lot of the reason I was a murder\nYou know here's what I ... I think yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump's responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see that map you doubt but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that lead to you\n\nKnow they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying that they pull back and deny it\nThe tight because we're coming right back\nGood afternoon I'm Doug group or here's today's closing markets December corn three sixty six and three quarters closed down one march three Seventy nine and a quarter closings recorders down November's soybean eight thirty nine six sandstone\nJanuary eight fifty two and a quarter a nickel and a half\nDown December we five o seven and a quarter up to December lived cattle one's Seventeen twenty five dollar Fifteen don't\nFebruary one twenty two weighty down sixty five feet or cattle January one forty nine eighty three Thirteen cents higher Marge one forty seven Ninety seven Fifteen cents higher\nLean hogs December fifty eight eighty five Ninety three ... sixty six Ninety or fifty three December recruits sixty\nSeven twelve forty seven cents a barrel down closing markets I'm Doug Cooper bring in\nToday it contained in jail without bond us attorney Scott Brady prosecutor saying they will seek the death penalty against the forty six year old and the ...\nMailing at least fourteen suspected pipe bombs to the critics of the president was in court today fifty six year old says or say are currently facing at least five felonies including threatening\nA former President Fox news\nStation where the news is six hundred W.

happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist and reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international political expert\nAt what have you and I used to think of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his\nBehavior and his ah\nCome Portman just isn't present central you know the usual complaints from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form

hour of the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's kinda understandable\nOne sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about on the way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about them that way but Trump dead\nAnd so they all start laughing they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting and their size\nIs not going to last this quake that\nTrump tapped slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this
