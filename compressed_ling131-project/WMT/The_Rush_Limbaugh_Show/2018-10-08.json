in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval\nOf winning

won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the

honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they\nRoutinely soft sell what they

span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards what does this she was running for attorney general ... is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we've highlighted here and I forgot what it is but it's in the\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez fame and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of this CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Britney Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nWhen you read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed and then in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported\nKavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst\nMen\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men work or don't match the lake guilty simply because they exist simply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that\nKavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss what is\nTranspiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate our youth that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that\nThis is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot who has put so much the on the spider Republican\nUh\n... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was\nWidely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heroes of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nCollar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women are these type of issues but I think largely that the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that\nBut that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by then it ought to be that people can't wait to punish this much ... for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone\nThe Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this\nBut I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have\nShow up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nThere is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month\nOr so ago that the that hadn't happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lotta people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened you know I just as a chuckle\nUm\nSo I can I can see what the passage just be you cannot main fee and this\nRiver passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about\nI'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade\nThere's still a month ago\nThe other side they had been shopping at the bit since election night two thousand

the turning point was Trump\nExplaining to the nation that loves the Ford could not backup or corroborate her story that has not happened that did not happen in the hearings\n... got away\nWith the incredible as far as the hearings were concerned only when when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she can't tell anybody where it happened when it happened what year it happened where the house was\nHow she got home what she said after it happened to whoever none of it the people that she said were there all for the night at the American people didn't know that the drive by

you with us\nOh wonderful to hear from your Rausch um I I'm On my listeners from the earliest days and I'll make a comment about the Democrats the whole process with his hearing and then if you have time I'll tell you how you converted my wife from my mom listener to one of your most loyal fans which is a crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearings what's so sinister and ironic and all this is if\nYou remember back\nTo Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days of my mouth out early but very a\nFaulty accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live ah every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these women they lead follow their looks really on the other way\nThey lost their stories of the faith discredit them they questioned the motives ... factor for where you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have\nVictims that remember in particular leader Broderick the type of place to who what where when with with\nUm and the army is so disgusting and there's no political ... with with a Bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party and that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon use ah and I have to call it a weapon for the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see Schumer I'm a turban on any number of them won't even take a call from ... to ... a member of their own party\nYeah but they said they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe ball the but the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault as evidenced by\nYour recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying it was called the ... rupture in June and it was Hillary and Betsy right Bob\nMenendez Democrat Senator ten point reelection Lee New Jersey was caught running around with one of those donors in the Dominican went under rage women narrowly escaped conviction in a trial over campaign contributions Democrats don't care about this\nThis was just a vehicle was just it was a Hail Mary it was a total surprise\nUm you name it it was just the vehicle they had tried it with Clarence Thomas Anita Hill they got close so they wanted to relive history and try this again\nUm I don't think any of it ... was real when you look at the Democratic activists that were involved with balls e forward I think the whole thing was strategize\nNow it's interesting you bring up the Clintons grab audio soundbites ten and eleven Saturday\nMichael Smerconish has a show on CNN his guests was James Carville and James Carville as the guy in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton years uh Paula Jones sued and\nClinton for for a number of things and that's where Clinton got in trouble by some warning perjury uh and lying under oath and a grand jury testimony lost his law license for a year ah it was James Carville said drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you're going to\nGet out here we are LBJ out your drag drag it out there trying to park and that\nWas it a hundred dollar bill or dollar bill a hundred dollar bill\nRight why they went cargo still proud of the remark\nHere's the question\nAnd what does it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed because then the base wouldn't be so mad so ticked off they all come out to

doing stories on Kavanaugh thinking you know they're going to keep them front and center he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just pick someone equally is right wing his
