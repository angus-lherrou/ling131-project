do people moving north but\nJust rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this was from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact\nThat a bunch of people like me who know or the climate change man made climate change as a whole are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota verbal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham\nHe's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some of your little rag\nOr a penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we're reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school the guy is still ranged this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republican\nIt was causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction under ... so\nThis clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you wanna stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat you'd literally there's one that's what he said in an unrelated story a bunch\nOf ... which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I I I don't know what the nature of the heck is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if it weren't so irresponsible it would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dennis simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking\nThere weren't people\nIn the leftist medium who literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as\nDemocrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing when he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\n\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThe Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply\nThe way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah\nIt's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters it got wiped out the odds are that work\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you don't we we we look at these events are these people do as one off political events some of these people who have been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with I mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives or it is it's just heartbreaking\nTo see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know I densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who lived there ... there were some who didn't evacuate and they made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in a wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how\nRaucous these Starman storms aren't they want to see it and they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw just today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop ... stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message and the hurricanes and go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes\nNo hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how stupidity how unfair to leap politically partisan\nBy the

you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how to do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you breathe and start criticizing everybody else\nSo they get

would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely tilt Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in

is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this was a\nTraditional year party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting hope will turn the hope into reality now before we get too much in the hour\nI Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands nobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie\nEquals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you\nGet money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they persisted and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie at its depicted in in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally\nWell done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraiser you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even\nAnd his trial that was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want the message\nTo be delivered but you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story itself\nIs all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human than a viable tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people who put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain has won\nThe ah the actor who plays a guy sell himself as a as an actor in a I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\n\nOf a job it's probably the finest role that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen\nWe're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking are here so you're not gonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story of the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a\nLot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy or directing\nThis is what the American

cause no movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America so whereas\nWe have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump\nFor inspiring Mohammed bin ... mom to murder a sold a Saudi journalist\nNow we have this NBC piece which is basically saying\nThat what this movie is inadvertently showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble springing up everywhere that guys now could not have become the mass murderer he became\nIf abortion would have been the legal which is a crock he did his monitoring after abortion it'd become legal\nBut they're trying to say everybody you know you better you'd better not get what you wish for here because if you if you ever get abortion we have a roe versus Wade overturned you're going to
