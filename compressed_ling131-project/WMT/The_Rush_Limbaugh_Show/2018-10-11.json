M. T.\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... comments and things here on the ...\nFive one five nine nine nine fifty four Ninety One nine nine nine five for nine one\nTwelve fifty three winding down the big show\nWhen the big show duck goof with markets Andy as well Andy we have a telephone line with us Don rose with the U.S commodities and you've been using dawn in these three big things today\nUm we've been talking about are one of the big things that came out about eleven o'clock was the USDA report ... give us the yeah the bullet points give us the highlights there\nYeah good afternoon when you look at it I think the surprise on the report was that ... year old\nWent down six tenths of a Bush on corn usually it goes up I think the other thing was the acres harvested acres on soybeans went down six hundred thousand acres and the yield only one up a three ten they left the demand\nCompletely un changed on soybeans and change the exports at all and they took the export up on core and so ah are balanced table is uh just over one point eight billion in corn but still a a half the eight hundred eighty five million on soybeans but\nI think the question mark Bob is have we talked into harbors low\n[noise] well it's interesting done usually big crops get bigger and court at least going the other way is that based on harvest results\nYou know I think it is I think when you look at it so far these yields I think number one remember we had just lost the yield already dialed in so um I think it was just probably over shot a and the government did have Nineteen hundred test plots\nAnd it looks like the U.S they harvested somewhere around Seventy five percent of those so um you know a little more accurate but\nUm you know and the government didn't account for the weather issues that we have also a this is the first of October and we although we've had issues with harvest here in the west or mid west so that one it may be out in front of us yet when you looked at the November report\nBut do you think about uh whether losses on corn and beans with some rotting issues or some pot issues\n[noise] well I think I think you have to say that that's a good possibility here that we'll see how the weather goes the rest of the ah the harvest here but uh you know when us know up in the Dakotas when you have a\nFlooding yet down in the delta and you have the big water logged areas of the mid west it certainly isn't the normal a harvest that you would like to get a crop out with good quality like we had last year\nWhat about a non harvest the boy acres is there a possibility with the all the ... that this particular soybean wise that could play a role\nIt could play overall I think we'll have to watch that and the and certainly the government took a Kansas guild ah acres down about four hundred thousand and uh you know from some uh issues down there so it's possible that that those acres usually they have it most of it adjusted right now\nBut it's still work in progress here and you know I don't think you want to get to bound up that this is just a crazy bullish a market\nBecause you're still lugging around eight hundred and eighty five million a ending stocks on soybeans which is monstrous an all time record on soybeans\nBut I think what it says is you know do you have to get real negative here either it's the Kerry and the market that you have to make sure that you can uh somehow capture as you go forward\nYeah I wanted to ask you about this to us you and ask him up today with their I'm twenty eight Tina ... statistics that hundred and twelve page\nUm thing that'll give you a headache if you try to read all of it but it it shows again that the cost of production is below or above the average market price done so a lot of ... on foreign storage is what it suggests\n[noise] well that's exactly right and he and I think what we're saying is this is a crop when it's large and you've got some marketing opportunities basis is too wide carries are too big that you have to try and merchandise your way into a profitable situation I think you can do it\nBut you have to be a you know able to use some of these tools so I think that's the key you know the other thing in this report the government left a Chinese imports and change so there you know sending a signal that the the global World Trade is not going to change a lot on soybeans all these for next year\nYou mean what we've heard a lot of fear and a lot of hype is that what you're saying done\n[laughter] well you know you you can have to read into the government and they are they saying we're going to improve the terrorists are going to ah you know eventually go away or they stay in that lives in the world is going to buy the soybeans from us and sell them or you know in the world so\nI'm you know you have to make them a function but it looks like it's not a completely lost you know on trade\nYeah Hey Don gotta run uh what's your eight hundred numbers\nYou can reach us at a one eight hundred two four seven for Osama bin Laden\nOn rose us commodities ... any what was your cost encore and you say three forty eight\nA average post production on corn three

demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find that with all the charted hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find you know significant trend in even the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exist and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter to the New York times and the rest of the drive by an offer to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to ... and he said why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you are the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong then you can be controlled to make sure that you\nStart doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want this but in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunderstorms\nHe doesn't know cloud tops some club temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Wonder was surely you that these kinds of things no longer [noise] bother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance\nExisting now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed\nThe futures of way too many women it has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences in has distorted the concept of happiness\nVictim ... it has just started the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for\nMorocco same all involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and these so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder was saying what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said\nScrew that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we get them so people's mind God he's out there inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we after stop being a nice guys and stopped taking it and\nHe didn't mean it Obama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\n\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races are over there are polls said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house\nIn their minds they most won the Senate they have the Mueller report and the mullah report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods they can taste it fall fall\nBecause they can scratch their bags with it they just can't aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove that Trump's only election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN engaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing at New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop\nMusic hip hop's class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was the future Kanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump ads is Jim Brown\nBy the white Trump is funding the Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why did you can Trump said you know what you have a point but there were people that\nHave been lined up for a day and a half to get interest either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunk I'm On a number of things in the short little press availability at the White House\nSo now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListen black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft don't ...\nAll of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he's he's an attention horror\nLike the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's a token negro the Trump Administration is a ridiculous\nSays the CNN paddle wider so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population and surrender that is what's happening here\nThey're soft coup failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guy\nYou're gonna wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of the Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration the soft coup if you work\n\nRemaining silent about the skill least shooting should have been a clue\nOf the Democrats depravity and intentions of what I mean by that\nThere was actually a shooting\nUp Republicans and baseball practice in preparation of a joint Republican Democrat baseball game it's a traditional annual thing and a lunatic deranged Democrat fundraiser donors supporter from Illinois shows up starts firing him almost kills\n... and the Democrats didn't say anything about it in the media didn't condemn it there wasn't any condemnation there was there was an overwhelming silence that shouldn't have been and was to me a clue\n\nTo the Democratic depravity American countries and now we've got Hillary now we get Maxine Waters Eric Holder it was the lead directing Democrats\nTo physically attacked\nHave a brand new sun bump with a battery backup they offer that if that's one of your concerns maybe you're just worried about some Sloan drains they can

confused my beef with UPS\nI I Know this stuff is lost that's what it is just trying to cover up for it anyway you know people are observing out there I got another email rush could you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee let me it's ... and I'll be ... if you\n[noise] I'll be glad to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat it is somewhat fascinates name as ... ... the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil now ...\nIs Saudi\nI don't know if he is related to add nan is Yogi not common ...\nIs is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a a lifestyles are the rich and famous\nBut the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer adamant that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... is a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin\nSome on as the crown prince in Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ... he is the brother of the late ... king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and ah oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lotta time an apple he wants to build a\nBrand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky but he represents\nIf he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women\nHe is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without mail it company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\n\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head\nYou don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\nJamal ... wanted to get married\nHe had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey in order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in\nIstanbul and hasn't been seen since\nThe court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they are not proposing in a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're\nBoth the right lose it when we're silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYep threats flying all of that\nAnd and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it show Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discouraging us enough that they could not go up that's the only way they win but Republican conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you

caller said\nAnd of course it flies\nIn the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking aren't\nPulling people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash\nWe were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent it was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter]\nDon't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation\nHe is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\n\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah\nA ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids are there are some\nThat I Am a not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand not even a letter written to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be\nSurprised 'cause the times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first and maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece\nThat memo that supposedly memo written by an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal as the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservatives and we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this and they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first I Would have to go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us somebody ... wrote it but I think this is somebody from the editorial board the editorial staff one of the up and people\nUm even though the left would leave on me and say that I should be feeling that way and I just really I Am so fired up especially with the Koch have announcing I feel like it's called divisive war on man\nI'm I'm so fired up I Want everyone to feel that way um I Am so committed to doing everything I can to expose is\nI'm I'm inviting all my friends to let's see GM [laughter] throughout the week and that that we can't we are going to get together and we're going to talk of I feel like you can't rely on the mainstream media to get any of that for you and I feel like that's the only reason why the less they had much reach that much power I think you\nKnow there's actually that is I'm very that that you're you're ... you're busy as a ... a ... isn't as great a senior you said you're a millennial so you're you're near thirty and\nI'm a yeah I'm On the upper ... I'll be thirty the next\nDay you're right there on the up read it but I I I remember about passion I remember I had it I still do that's the great thing\nA lot of people outgrow it a lot of people grow out of it when they when they don't see as much success as they envisioned when they don't see it happening as quickly or some people it's not that they give up they they just uh lose some of the pack don't lose the passion\nExactly who not lose the passion as you continue to do this\nI Will not I'm so fired up and I get that kind of gave me the more people like him to come out I feel so bad for the audience that sort of like um attack me thing like oh I'm Republican Ron conservative I Can't imagine what it's like for him I think he's doing an amazing thing\nAnd I think this is a really pivotal time and I think I have hope that the left is it losing it and the unraveling and\nI have hope for my generation I think\nI'm so enthused to hear that [laughter] I I I you're you are the second is maybe the third millennial aged color today with the same belief that that that what you're watching on on the left or something and unravel I'm you're watching them come on glued\nAnd I I Hope you're right I I Would make perfect sense to me the thing is well here I'm up against time look\nThanks so much for the call appreciate it keep the passion [noise]\nGiven I Wish you\nGood

while to kick him here and I'm\nLike oh my\n\nGod given the buffer of the [noise]\n\nNew York magazine and look at us Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results\nIs this not hilarious looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you right now that I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the votes\nThey wanted I think what was the objective was\nTo be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThe trouble with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be in the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat an upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up and said no [laughter] I don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nDidn't believe me saying this this is an unwritten so then Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what\nThey should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate with Clinton and October the nineteenth he said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nThan roads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try an forestall a political crisis by validating be election results so\nThis is not funny looking like they're hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ...\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell\nAnd ... rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fond of result as well as the conclusions raged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this\nRussia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're gonna use it give Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal this election\nAnd Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame bulletin she overcame the all the garbage she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nStory New York magazine they think they're doing an ad a boy here they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that\nThere was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome ended up happening to the benefit of Hillary Clinton

have both bought in to the fact that [noise] honors\nDid exactly the opposite is judge jury and loud executioner but a probation officer for Hillary\nJade did it violated all of it so why did he get away with it and nobody else can I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... ... you mean call me going going yes I'm Sorry [noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm I made the same point I when I heard they don't drunk and ... call me exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they have pulled\nRequired her to win for them to stay employed in front of the tricks they had pulled on Trump to remain unknown so she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged\nIn relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in classified data and so forth [noise] see I have the same reaction you ... what do you mean it'll come out in collisions\nI under I understand that that you had to get off but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never in trial\nIt was oh he no wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch\nEnded up having to her she didn't officially recused but because she met was slick willy on the plane on the tarmac out in Phoenix call me said she's compromise so he basically took over the gang of eight gee for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on July fifth did that press conference\nUnder the auspices of making the decisions because the Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just ... open it and say it didn't have the legal right to make a decision so let's start over from where he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why

the real crimes and criminality that's taken place while spending all of this time trying to find the crime\nThat they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to\nIt's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't greasing frustration at the president for not declassify these documents that will answer the question you're asking\nDon't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen's gain the guy who in a meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had had a conversation with\nTrump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfit and they were going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen steam so I'm just kidding I just it was the people in the ... they say he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still inside outing upside down over Trump and I think what every success\nAnd every smile on Trump's face with every piece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds something that Trump has not damaged by saying every effort every things they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it and
