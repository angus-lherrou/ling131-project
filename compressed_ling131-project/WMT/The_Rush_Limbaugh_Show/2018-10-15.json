the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you have to try it again I Know and my hunch is the answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhite and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively in Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less they still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got it in a roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said\nBecause I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussion is in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell them about my opinions of the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'd be really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I\nI think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised this honest that's the word he uses instead of\nBiased\nAnd I can tell you that that is true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of\nIn ways you and I did but now since he

opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind\nSupply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three hundred and some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent so you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... and so the bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid

going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay if other than a warmer serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black clubs Trump these black urban Obama ... sad\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here the son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot pinpointed\n\nMy house in an educated guess are the critical I'm a I'm an educated guess here\n... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side this guy's going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in\nTrump's then you have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I\nThis is the kind of I think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get

talking about the necessity of consequences\nFor illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books but they didn't enforce that line for them that were launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with children\nAnd then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into all kinds how are you going to go back to that cat in the west is Lesley from coming into\nOur country illegally and part of\nMain part of the reason that I have to blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't force separation that just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it than there has to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force than what you mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included attempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that's separate they don't run from the family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise\nSome guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\n\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families when it's a law that he inherited I've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally it has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\n\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their uh their family their their their adult parents cases are being a Jew became there's nothing\nThere's nothing I mean this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more on a smear\nAt the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not back down from it and even as I say ... the magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next\nShe says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nSix hungry W.

much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activist concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you\nDefine that let glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's on a good host I I haven't been there and no one argument thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection now to come straight out of Marxism Marx said that everyone is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later is now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how the press them how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful uh ... intersection out on the next and it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation ths with that with militant Islamic lists that than with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable the says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops at some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old pressed she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore sees impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I can I took a DNA test about four years ago\nAnd of course you don't normally you've never seen me but believe me I'm whites however when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just a minute sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks in okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to some continent than some people really get confused you're coming from I'm from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert\nA which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding\nThe
