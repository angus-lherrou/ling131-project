issuing statements today condemning\nThe use of bombs for any purpose whatsoever and we here at the E R B network heartily\nAnd energetically endorsed the premise that we oppose bombs for any purpose whatsoever [noise] ah in domestic politics or what have you on time we support bombs is during warfare\nA declared hostilities warfare but bombs in politics or caravans wrote we hardly\nWe hardly condemn this dastardly action and what do you know way encourage it or support so Justin a record that's my official statement yeah should release listened writing\nTo um [noise] just got to make sure that we hear the number are included in the list of people condemn 'cause I don't want to be on the list of people who support\nOr are there any is there a list of people support bombs that that is going out there I think the list is only people who condemn them right we want to make sure we are on there that list we don't want there to be any doubt [noise]\nThat we condemn the mom\nSo suspicious packages slash bombs that did not go off\nHad been sent to Democrats before the mid term elections is it real or is it a political set up\nIs it a political stunt and if it is who's behind if it's a political stunt who's behind it and for what purpose I've seen some people today who think the Republicans are behind this detritus scared Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do\nIn fact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning there's the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out\nAs a Democrat and condemning the Democrats centrally said that this is about\nAll of us Republicans just don't have a behavioral history like this so it was a political staunch who is behind it and for what purpose\nWell the capital of thing was a set up but it looked real for a while the capital of thing was a set up from the get go we of course here at the network knew that but a lot of people\nThought it was real on ... it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't covered their bases long\nEnough to\nWant to pull that off Hillary Clinton rumored to run for president just before her certain to be primary intended national tour with her husband\n\nWe have a massive land force invasion heading toward our southern border meant for a confrontation just before election day\n\nWhat if there are leaks from Muller about his report before the elections political stunts or not\n[noise] would Mahler in the media really do that\nLook what happened to the FBI in two thousand sixteen they tried to fix it election for a Democrat they tried to screw a Republican out of the election and I mean these are all things don't we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\n\nThe one thing that we know to be true the Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at\nThis for the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR all of these angry mobs and I don't care what anybody thinks\nThose angry moms are not good for the Democratic party those angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal join us\nMuch as the media would like to portray it otherwise and much of the Democrats would like to portray of otherwise the people of this country do not want to spend all day and all night everyday enraged and angry\nThat's not what life is to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is for your average Democrat today in ... angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they were hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrats mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who I've been caught on tape for rent named Republicans at airports\nRepublican offices\nThat had been vandalized rocks thrown for windows Kevin McCarthy the most recent\nAngry mobs sending packages that claimed to be rice and the two Republican Senator Susan Collins at her house\nWe have seen these angry mobs in the halls of the Senate during the capital hearings we have seen these angry bombs at\nPolitical rallies we have seen these angry mobs come from seeing people in public in restaurants doesn't matter where and they have all been\nDemocrat angry mobs and there has not been a single condemnation from any Democrat like everybody today is condemning these bombs there hasn't been a single condemnation by any Democrat for these mob actions taking place\nThat have been going on since even before that Kavanaugh hearings\n\nReally focused and got synthesized when it began to appear that Kavanaugh was going to make him and that this balls the foreign tactic was going to fall apart the mobs went nuts approaching\nJeff Flake in the elevator approaching Republicans in the halls Lindsey Graham is ... ... if saw that\n\nThis cannot be good these ain't reminds I don't care what Democrats think they can now see it isn't working the Republicans are pulling ahead and the Senate and when we get into the discussion of the latest\nRegarding mid term elections as the program unfold today I've got a couple of pieces today from people who think that not only if they're not going to be a blue wave that if there were it would be cresting right now and it isn't I I got a couple of people been analyzing things who think that there could very well\nBe a red wave not just in the Senate but in the house the point is the mob actions that have been sponsored by undertaken by Democrats and their activists again have not been condemned and they haven't worked their\nPurpose they're mob purpose was to engender author anger at Republicans and therefore in gender angry Democrat turnout but walk\nRepublican turnout in early voting is dwarfing the Democrats in some places it isn't even close and it's a hundred and eighty degrees out of face\nNothing like what the political experts and scientists told us what happened in an off year election this was gonna be the Democrats elected they were going to show up in droves energized\nThey were going to be so excited they were going to be so motivated Republican early voting is dwarfing there's nothing out there other than Nate Silver and a couple of other polling units that suggests\nA blue wave and what kind of blue way it's gonna be if it doesn't include the Senate\nIf some people now that think the Republicans might end up uh fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all of a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us that would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat\nThat doesn't look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics haven't worked\nAnd in fact if you're a reasonable Democrat operative when you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action\nCould be hurting it could be really firing up Republican turnout as in the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabin on the fact that it's going one way pro Republican\nDocument as well what if these mobs\nPointed at Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in airports whatever these mobs attacking people aren't\nSome of the

she said the way to do with that is still a wet cabinet that can bring us together\nAnd of course that means Democrats so you're ... by the way the bomb that was sent to the Clintons and Obama never got to their homes just F why we still condemn them don't misunderstand the\nBombs were intercepted by the postal service at one of the distribution center so they were discovered very quick into bomb that was not\nThe CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work CNN and it was addressed and John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN he was over at at a at MSNBC so I'm\nHillary Clinton right on schedule is now out reacting to this putting on his face of bravery in college she is willing should be subject didn't do attacks like this because America is worth that kind of things\nAnd that you got to make sure they got out there and vote for the right candidates are going to bring this to a screeching halt arms Mrs\nClinton it's your party forgive me that is

I'm a deranged a lunatic Trump supporters and so in the midst of this\nAtmosphere we have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats and it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass\nAnd so far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain of what to make this uh this is just it's it's it's not it's not Republicans that show up for example\nAt the offices of the family or what but it's a you know the pro life groups offices some guy shows up in with a gun and it was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to sue the

make everybody think right off the bat that some\nTea Party or dead or some talk radio fan and did it or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case not one of these bombs went

Evans that in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that themselves but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the

radar [noise]\n\nNo no I mean how how ... or the or the Clintons an obstacle for the upcoming midterm the Clinton ... ... ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar\nExcept they are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens\nIs you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger wife an America is not saying that this is just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you

sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information out there for the masses of pain you know there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in\nCocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more port going it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then ...\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary enemy of domestic beer housewife in iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\n... it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was\nTaking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence\nIs with them as soon as I say this\nIs a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program asking people to never forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to\nGet themselves on the radar but see that's I think they're trying to get\nNoticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some Gloria trying to show everybody he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell
