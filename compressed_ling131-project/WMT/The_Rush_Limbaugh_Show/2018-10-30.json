M. T. [noise]\nBig show [noise]\nThan we're back on the big show and we've got Don rose on the line Andy and I want to clarify know what I meant by\nDr seuss a market book is all these things done are you there\nGood afternoon okay I Want to explain this I found a little hesitant and you're done [laughter]\nAll these things that the ... the you've told us about selling the on by October to put those in froze so people would remember him as you leave through this book in Dr seuss pros that's what I was saying I don't know that it came out quite that way I wasn't meaning to insult\nYou [laughter] well I Know you wouldn't do that to compare it with I think with this [laughter]\nAs accessible as Dr seuss was by comparison it'd be a compliment with mixed things like that to use your remember when you put him in no it is you're you know what I'm saying anyway it was a an attempt at humor that I think kind of felt kind of flat and I apologize well the market has been kind of humor less so thanks for trying to inject some here done it's just that much of anything going on\nIt seems like no well I think a couple of things you know we still have the weight of the harvest coming at us harvest is very aggressive as you know soybean by the end of the week will be wrapped up in a lot of areas the mid west of it is already\nThe corn harvest is aggressive and I think we're trying to decide that end user wants to get covered down here the producer doesn't want to sell here but he doesn't want to pay the storage and the drive down so\nAh the trade right now I think is just kinda leaking low and we pointed out those seasonal allergies earlier this as a negative time of year for corn and wheat soybeans more and more\nPositive but um you know we'll see if the crops get smaller on we're going to have a lot of yield estimates coming out here in the next few days yeah\nWe're hearing lower numbers or corn and soybeans maybe drop off a little bit too\nYou know I think they will a bit you know just because the yields are sold off before and then we did have that raining and after the rain and those big advance it seemed like for some reason we lost three to five to six bushels an acre in different areas so\nYou know when you hear that when you get those it if it's not a consistent crop it's hard to add bushels to it so I think that the issue so I think the key is for this market is don't term negative on break and don't turn to polish on rallies\nAnd we're just kind of caught in this trading range with Brazil to remind is off to a record fast planting paste and they're going to have a beam available the end of December hard to believe in to our early January\n[noise] yeah what is it like Seventy four percent complete versus the average forty eight percent or some ridiculously high number that's a that's going on there and do we know acreage wives down they're what they're expecting\nWell yeah they're looking for the ... not as wild expansion as you might think but it was up about two two per se on um the other thing though that did change as they did have a can a just a new president elected a conservative\nAnd it is a a belief that they're going to relax some of these uh acre restrictions and he could he acres the advanced the bit maybe not this year but next year\nThis is talk some livestock here Don a nearby hug trade is a positive the deferred months or a little lower but with a nice little run here so as of late\nWell it's been a very strong run and I think when you look at it the hard market is pretty clear cut it kind of what we call either a boom bust type of market uh because\nIt's the supplies are large not only in the airport but the poultry and also the beef so if we don't have the big issues with African swine fever that come to a that equals out big demand out of China around the world maybe not necessarily from us but take a pork off the world market\nAnd lead to some big buying we're probably inflated remember the government we're about eighty three dollars on June and July hog\nThose are just three dollars off the top that we had last year on a on a blog bigger supplies this year and the government's playing for the second quarter fifty four to sixty so we're not even close that eighty three from what the government says so\nIt certainly is one that I'm with all the answer is Spanish\nWell and speaking of the African swine fever yesterday it was as long as it stays in China doesn't make it here probably not much of an impact on us and then today Rob and he's got this report that says imports are up ... percent year over year in the past month so who knows what the heck's going on over there\nWell you know and that's a good question because you know are we getting accurate reporting over there were also pick it up that uh that you know they're cutting better scaling back the meal UC severely trying to bridge the gap it to South America soybean\nI'm about to crush plants over there it doesn't show it shows that they're actually they're crushing more soybeans and they did last year in the month of October so it's a little bit of a cross current and like we always say\nTruth is in in what happens in the real marketplace\nWell yeah and then we saw a story that said that cut back in in soy protein isn't enforceable was never going to happen what should be supported by what you're saying with the crush number so I guess wait and see on that in the meantime how do we get in touch with you done\nYour back and reaches that one eight hundred two four seven ... seven one\nDon rose us

Fox News Whitey Bolger who spent years on the runways eighty nine and had just been moved to a new prison last night Fox has gone off scot more line\nIt needs to be addressed every effort the Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to judge this just being ... upset Trump's base that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a classic\nExpression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to get more details on I ... back to my little test so I ran out of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being Trump's you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five feet incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on this is a student at the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first midterms after a presidential election all ways Louis ... seats so forty five seats they cave and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs\nAnd this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on is that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are set up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not going to stay at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called American dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nWhen Robert my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the red\nPeel movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but ... says he's got eight\nProductions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan crisis mailed bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical\nChange at least that has been the case or in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy Heller would argue that Democrats in the media think it is a problem\n\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls\nSurprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was no I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usually the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these wells are prizes and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans were holding the house\nAll of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative red wave\nAccording to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded blue wave you\nBy the way this is what you want a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue\nWave a blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these ... were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nBut the conclusion is it there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple\nThat you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip some blow bubbles are bursting recall the blow bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities\nSo this guy is of the firm\nAnd so they quote unquote took the high road or the\nStomach Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be part of potentially split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that\nCould end up being a net positive okay when we come back to the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City bombing and\nNow me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this

I'll admit it ... I was livid and of course as a lone voice at the time I was a little alarmed can they make this debt\nAnd of course they weren't able to and even now a certain members of the drive by caution everybody and it remind people Clinton try when Clinton was called on it by the way Clinton's hey we I was at talk about [laughter]\nAs talking about that [laughter] Michigan Militia shortwave radio do that right that Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking it blew up in their faces and this continues to to\n[noise] but let's get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through\nOn one of the primary commitments he made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in\nCases it's even worse than that and the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrown from the days of its founding\nTo the left America as illegitimate it's immoral it's in decent because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else\nAnd it's time to overthrow that and change it and it's a serious movement and it's it's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the ... gene seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself\nIt's game against the Detroit Lions will be carried on one hundred point seven the buck Sunday afternoon\nPre game with Paul Allen starts at eleven AM kick off at twelve noon a\nSpecial NFL broadcast Viking life this Sunday on one hundred point seven five [noise]\nAnd it's the same thing that they did on Trump's travel ban and so forth\nBut still despite all that I ... I think it's smart to make it an issue\nThe west can sit out there in the ring its hands over oh my God Trump is just trying to rile up his base it's cold winning an election ... we've got into a dangerous point here where to go left refuses to accept election outcomes\nAnd folks that cannot lead the anything good that has always been the glue that's held us together\nI I ... I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together of the way it has for many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up while it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days\nWhen we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment\nIt derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this and right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election that is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of\nWho they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and\nIt's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right\nAnd that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling the news civility and let's tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody we need to

M. T.\n\nV.\nAnd\nBack to the phones with all of this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame them it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... it it it's we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that about slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restricted the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo ... for citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nUh people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods are Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ...\nDitto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company got we got to do this we got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up as being set in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York building your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that not Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah [laughter]\nLook we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nAnd it was on my door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another\nAnd\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ...\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these

people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states are

M. T.\n[noise]\nI'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent\nCaller I lost her when she just how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that\nThat has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence has the governor the media was outraged and they began to report\nOn this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it and what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for winning and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana ...\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist humble pubs\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral\nSeats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so I guess if if if what media dead ... to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and er and accept it and it's this arrogance\nAnd this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nA the synagogue shooting quality obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks that it is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who knows they are not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating us and them I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but\nThe electoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this in pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
