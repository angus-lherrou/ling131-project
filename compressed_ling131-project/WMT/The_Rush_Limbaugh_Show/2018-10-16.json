{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "They get even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces this\n\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it doing clue in South America when other reason\nThere isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the\nCherokee tribe the leaders will tell you you don't use DNA to the terminal any injured they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story\nI get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any\nNative American DNA by the way this was not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate the future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people to lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed an even\nGreater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish\nCan do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house at a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party who lost over twelve hundred seats\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred\nSeats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more in the end the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a robot shouldn't where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody didn't know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington\nDC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTend the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral process of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has to stop the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats\nSince the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media\nSo says the Democrat Party well on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against that\nIn common sense there's no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave\nIn two thousand Eighteen this is the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying for\nNone of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were very by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six ... presidential election\nThey mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life of a career that passed the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it something you'd never Trump is but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen that Democrats attempts on Kevin on\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out\nIn his career in front of a of a stadium or arena sized crowds\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation dad he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it\nNobody else liked the turtle in our party yes those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment to Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and twenty four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\nIt's scratch bank or said like crazy come to dynamite for help\nEight five nine four to eight one eight five to eight dollars an hour [noise]\n\nI'm

M. T. [noise]\nI don't even think [noise]\nAnd I didn't hear about it I don't think any of the women paying JFK I make the money all went away from him and to them but here comes Donald Trump prostitute pays\nAnd the four women these four\nWomen have one thing in common Dianne Feinstein Hillary Clinton Stormy Daniels she's the one I couldn't think of it Elizabeth Warren\nAll four of them\nAre just raided damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted when the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a Dennis ... of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people find the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied to focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of Native American DNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for native\nAmericans now she's out there touting that it's true is she's an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\n[noise] and there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\n... minutes laughable it is the static\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every out there saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica limit no no no no no not was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be embarking on what\nA stadium tour or yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do in that can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what\nTrump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had I've never really they or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe lake is Donald from you know what this is like is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as but Russia killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it\nNever has happened every attempt to supplant take over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium\nTour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want not you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites are Nate Silver this is the go real data analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox it back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver at election night two thousand sixteen five PM\nVignettes shakes with great service and Warren ... and you can get on line financing so go with the best and get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rhino save dot com rhino safe dot com\n[noise]\n\nWay one of the reasons the Democrats are so angry so ... so in same aside from the fact that many of them are suffering psychological disorders is that they know what I told you is\nThrough they've been losing elections left and right everything has been going against them and now they've lost the Supreme Court seat\nAfter trying this wave October surprise to destroy capital and folks it all makes it there's nothing about this and orders for a blue wave now\nYou have to have some ... which all share with the with the program unfolds I Want you to hear the standing ovation attorney got this\nWould never have happened I don't know how long it's been it's Mitch McConnell was greeted with this kind of love and respect and excitement by a Republican audience anywhere but Donald Trump brought him on the stage\nAt a mega rally in Richmond, Kentucky on Saturday thanking the turtle for standing firm on Kavanaugh and listen to the react\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI guess I'm Talking are we're proud of bragging frog [noise]\nAs Mitch McConnell got that kind of a reception\nAt a political

I I'm not I'm gonna I'm going to go on in the limousine Mitch might like\nEverybody like that especially people that are on accustomed to it and\nEverybody in the world knows that it was the Trump stir made it by the white Trump tweeted you know after the news that the prostitute has to pay him [laughter]\nImagine how that chick some are not even JFK was able to pull that off he still had to pay the prostitute has to pay Trump so Trump tweeted that\nFederal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit Trump is entitled to fully legal fees right now I can go after horse racing her third rate lawyer and a great state of Texas she'll confirmed whether she's not she knows nothing about me a total\nCon he called her horse race\n[noise] somebody has to have to say you should probably be met for news radio do when you and [noise]\nSay folks if your own land\nYou're going to want to listen to this my good friends with my Hendra may have the best Mahindra tractor deal I've ever seen for a limited time get them a hindrance ... twenty S.

M. T.\nEvent and it off it's not not when you send Fifteen people now there's one other thing about this box that the media in the United states is trying to say to report\nThey're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder\nBecause ... show he was wearing an apple bought\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look ended up she had the structures to call somebody didn't\nCome back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognize sort of getting married a fiance that's waiting outside in the family sedan\nAnd she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and married bought something\nCould happen are reporting that here's ... was recording everything\nThat happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone and apple ... even if if the show he had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nL T each service to the to the I watch apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your prepared iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou\nIts its maximum twenty yards is Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think on the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch ...\n... it's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of which will be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\n\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start ... can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be\nAt some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back into close proximity the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting\nIt needs an iPhone and Android remained paired to the iPhone you can't be more than I Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family said Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay if a secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign and Rob Mills out I this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state of what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project Vera toss it Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this very task news have been reported\nSo we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ medium Breitbart News in oak cure report but there's no way piece here why there is no New York times here there is no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat\nEven though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station mentioned I don't know about Kim Alexis St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing Yahoo News nothing not one\nDrive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project berets us every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers at TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project ... us secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the in the project maritime us secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nFamously but I mean I think we can actually who is is is that it was just a minute on on on how many movies are eight or\nNine amassed Brian [noise]\nWere you able to hear of that are you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that\nOr even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows\nHe just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all both house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\n\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity magazine or what what about for an outright ban oh yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way [noise] she'll say fast\nDot com but use my name and you'll get fifty dollars off your first set\nOf sheets [noise] and I think you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna be

retail store would would be close to a thousand dollars is the same shape that you know four or five star hotel luxury suite\nYou use that you get if these are two hundred and fifty and the reason is they sell directly to you and there's no middleman markup retail uh in addition a wholesale advertising promotion budgets and so they're able to sell these at a price point\nThat they consider to be much more reasonable that's why they did another reason for dealing on line as they want to have a personal relationship with every customers so it's bowling branch B O L L\nAnd branch dot com we
