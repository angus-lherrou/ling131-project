use and a ... we didn't get a chance to talk about targets moving forward but I'm the soybean market has been improving right along or what do you think about going out on a limb here and see a little more proven the soybean market\nYeah I thought I'm going to target you know in the November ah around eight eighty eight eight nine ... charter check to say I have that's not a\nNot a real get rich type of sales but it could look at what the report indicates next Thursday\nOn the nearby December corn will get up and test resistance up around three Seventy two certainly for farmers who have story chip at some of your ... the head and figure out a way to carry this crap\nI think futures will be better ... be better significantly possibly by the first quarter\nOf two thousand Nineteen so you got to sell stuff right off the combine use those price targets otherwise she and a range of ban I think story and soybeans from now till next June but I looked at the potential basis appreciation plus the carrying charge out to July night Cain\nCould pick you up a dollar a bushel so uh trying to find a home for those beans and all the events in next year I think could be the right decision\nIn November of twenty Nineteen Alan I'm looking at nine thirty five is that something to be thinking about\nThat really a voice for most people even though they are really manage their cost down I Would hope that we can look at nine eight to ten dollars sometime during the ... going here\nSome of the studies and I would agree with is which cash we could have five to seven million acres less soybeans next year three to four million acres for corn three to four million acres for weight so he went to the contrary you put together a pretty nice story for the price sometime in two thousand ...\nEven with nearly a billion bushels of I'm hanging out over there in the area\nThat we'll see what you're seeing in case on Thursday but\nUh that's not new new batch that's why prices are where they're at right now so hammered prices lower I think we're going to get some\nOther factors coming in also watch the weather down south America looks like we did have an El Nino forming and typically those years and we have an El Nino for me and not get ill or production out of South America and right now we're seeing record\nProjections for the crop size of South America I think twenty percent more corn there last year twelve percent more soybeans my experience watching the software crop is when you get everybody that gun ho about the crop try this early ... inevitably something bad happened\nHistorically El Nino ... have been pretty good for a growing crops if it stays employees who could ruin Susan\n[noise] yeah just give us a milder winter in North America in pretty good uh crops in the U.S but it does have a history of causing problems in Australia Brazil and Argentina so\nIt's pretty early or it's not a real strong El Nino so far and there's a long time but uh everybody so seems like they're having a contest to come up with a bigger number for South America and medical whoa whoa whoa it's pretty early to make those protections\nYeah well sounds like your strategies store this crop I'm Out I I Want to ask you though about a basis and again kind of give me some insight on on what's going on out there which again probably comes back your strategy stored\nYeah we're seeing that thing it's really bad up in North Dakota basis levels vitamin a dollar Ninety shutting elevators are not ... bad typically sixty or Seventy percent\nOf the crop from North west Minnesota North and South Dakota ends up to the POW put a ship and shipped over to China they're not buying any this year\nSo that's causing the whole basis area to walk back up a lot of the elevators or tried to figure out a way to get at St Louis and so like in ... as for the farmers in southern Iowa and Missouri and uh so I think it's all backed up\nA longer term we can work together get an agreement both trying to get some beans going back out of the W. that's where I think you could see some very significant basis of growth but by some time and the first or second quarter of Nineteen I'm I'm not real optimistic short term\nThe month of October quite often and when you put into harvest blows but when you look beyond that I think you could see some

clearing a key hurdle today mainly along party lines not sharing helper and live on the hill\nFBI friend Monica Monica McLean was pressuring legal in the Kaiser to modify her testimony\nAnd statements so as to say that she\nOh you don't want to just remember I was there I remember the capital of it I remembered that's what they wanted her to do\n\nYou thought it was kind of dubious you bought it might've been old sketchy ... forge best friend\nA retired FBI agent we mentioned is through your earlier this week a former deal Jay official may have ties\nTo the FBI's attempt to uh run that cool on Trump her name is Monica McLean again and they were together on July third against when Ford was writing a letter to Feinstein labor in Delaware at McLean house\nAnd leaving Kaiser is that an ex wife of Bob ... a former Democrat political operative Fox News commentator and CNN commentator\nThey wanted her they pressured her to revisit her statement the wall Street Journal has the story or has the story today this was witness tampering this was this was asking a witness to lie\nSo as to buttress the story told by Dr balls the Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the beach buddies\nOf Dr Ford's if this isn't witness tampering somebody needs to tell me what it is\nCharles Grassley was on Fox but Grassley as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been an fire some thing has really\nSet him off\nI Would think that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face of out writing bias he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate wanna grass leaves points is ... and John Cornyn two if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all a nominee has to be is accused\nOf something and that kills the nomination then where are we hadn't we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nJust to refresh remembered bossy foreign and leaving Kaiser worm worm ... some of them are living some say best friends at the time of the alleged attack by Capitol\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls the Ford attempted to just credits her\nBy saying what she's got health problems can't ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad for her\n\nTurns out that Leland Kaiser is a former pro golfer she does have back and neck problems but not mental health issues ... Monica McLean again multi boards lifelong best friend and the woman balls the Ford allegedly coached prior to taking a polygraph test\nIs ... Monica McLean is all over this story we only learned her name in the past week or so\n\nAnd according to reports Monica ... plan was bowls the foreign side and the hearing room before she testifies she was I have now seeing\nPhotos anyway Grassley said on Fox in France this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on by allies of Baltimore for it as well not just legal in Kaiser\nOther witnesses were leaning that means every senator has seen that every senator just read the report his seen this\nAnd that apparently isn't changing any votes of the vote was fifty one to forty nine\nMansion flight and Collins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule\nBefore for forty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after this vote was taken\nNow I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by it Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now gonna not going to change I mean if we have the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comment and it's not just on social media but so the officers that so many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used\nTheir entire families are being threatened\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous it\nIs never ending the funds don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in his ... it is vile and it is evil and it's not just flake\nAnd Collins and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins I think they have to be\nCredited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mobs squad on the left but other Democrats\nAre in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted and they're still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this is his final term\nThe easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine\nI Can't describe for you you might\nHave an idea you probably know the things that are being sent to these people the rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\n\nIt's unhinged much of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute and how the mainstream of the Democratic party the protestors are paid their signs\nAre all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ...\nBy them but if you have an if you believe them they can on an interview and yet flake\nCollins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't\nWhen I\nDo not have to wait until I saw I feel very encouraged that\nActually people around the country I Believe that we're stepping over the coming summer here we can't find the first night he went down in the elevator with me how far flung elected official ten minutes before we celebrate talking about how the\nGoing to try and see CNN sitting outside planning this

M. T.\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs as founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration wants to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so what did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nSome of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack looking is a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance self reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets that the masculine\nAs they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even

around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just\nTargeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\n\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence\nBase here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up\nA guy

an announcement three o'clock you voted yes\nTo continue the process you voted yes on the procedural vote there can be the only one reason to call a three o'clock announcer say you're going to vote no after after suggesting that process go forward you shut down the process a I realize a lot of people think that that's one so that that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing is going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing\nThat she's going to do this after this program and was mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly has absolutely things that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I Am going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone through many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nYeah however that rush a good to talk with you [noise] um this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted\n'em as Kaiser on and trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA sheep those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah and that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your chest with those two stories have not been\nReported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times associate oppressed people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the test of mine she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yeah it was a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... a Delaware with my client yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet [noise] I I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out\n...\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all of this is about to come out\nNext not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that end Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate both\nDemocrats can't delayed a vote anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\nWell the question is why wouldn't Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy make better ever took up a um [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report\nThey discovered that my\nMy to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the

alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animate I've never seen the turtle is adamant\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might've Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you Charlayne when producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucially Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed away and we want to see it\nThey won't let them see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must be you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick BJ's my and

how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this was the kind of ... out of the violation and I\nShouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't have been to the senator or the the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not

she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if\nDemocrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump presents an amazing display\nOf

get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms of the words in her study of things\nMcLean is lawyer\nIs David Yalof men from the archives the Washington Post February ... this guy was instrumental in the process the way it was the
