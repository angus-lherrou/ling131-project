I'm\nNot\nIgnorant about this I Know they're unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unify behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes fears head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\n[noise] it didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA head of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and\nI still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by immediate isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not at all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic it is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for\nIts all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective and the the obvious that there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody is exactly the threat to this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with seven thousand\nPeople that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claim they're walking\nThere not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible so when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody\nSet this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of a leftist set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder\nWhat it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me not only\nExamining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentments\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it ... or ... or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of\nStories today on the polling leading up to the midterms because it is all\nOver the place\nAnd it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver who has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning\nControl of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five thirty it's\nForecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency\nAnd Trump pan what twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes\nRaces individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way\nThey're going to go the cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecasts there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts\nFollowing the party's massive\nFundraising haul in the third quarter of this year\n[noise] so those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News in the wall Street Journal blue wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key states\nIn\nThis story is even is even prepared and written as another sign that this so called blue way am eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all [noise] NBC News\nHas looked at early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina GOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have Democrat\nAffiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in the early voting the latest data from NBC suggest robust in a fool's Yaz among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have an advantage with in person early voting so for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are growing up in the early ... because of early voting\nAnd the Republicans have to then make up for a bad on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News so\nThe question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat's why we spend tens of thousands of dollars targeting and attracting hundreds of qualified buyers every month\nThat creates demand in our homes and helps himself faster and

Trump spreads lives in stokes fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about mistakes are there is no body in Morocco Obama's league in terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average and you won't premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turned out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote did the media run\nBanner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Ben ... just after with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of caused the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protect himself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision\nAbout the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand ten minute germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody well\nWhere did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember who's\nIn the ad is faced in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is ... to ... for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances have his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stabbed aside and like government take care of things this guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons and open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes and our stockpiled then I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay\nTo vote against the interests of the first African American president then the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama that couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when it came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nPut a picture up we got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey'd been lied to for so long about things that the the\nDo they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on able to accept that Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two guys make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally having the president of states where people up into a frenzy ... is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man where has this guy been to the Trump whipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can give you got all kinds of you can go be a waiter you obviously listen well\n\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm going to cut your throat and you know just ... I I went up to him after was over and I talked to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack\nHillary's already done whatever she's done to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor to these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises that guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence they think Trump is recommending and praising ... ... ... ... but they just I I have never seen a group\nOf people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other\nHe goes up to this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're doing I really didn't want to see what you're you know I'm just wondering what the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with you\nSo these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said ... it's great that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand the real life America\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for\nNews radio\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf you're eight Seventy five are older and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger life policy did you know\nYou can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy in the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for\nMany people need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five you have a one hundred thousand dollar or larger life was yeah I Want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy into cash right this number down eight four four\nWe buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever called eight ...\nW E DUI Seventy five that's a four four we buy Seventy five\n... ... do you buy life guide\nGiven I what did you know there's a full service tree nursery located ten miles from your home now is the time\nTo be defined your whole neighborhood and your community with trees from Louis brothers St Louis brothers tree farm is over a thousand trees\nGrowing on eighty acres of Iowa soil servicing all in eastern Iowa Lewis brothers tree farm works primarily with residential and commercial free planning for over twenty five years visit them online and Louis ... dot com liked him on Facebook for fall specials call them at three one nine eight to eight four five six nine\nBy what Penn State one of the big games in the Big Ten this weekend at the Peterson and Justice Roberts will provide the preview on the corps slide comfort care of eastern Iowa bumper for putting a check in with Gary ... read from the forecast food in happy valley presented by pretty frozen custard and for\nSaturday morning at eleven thirty get game ready with of course life comfort care of eastern Iowa bumper to your home\nThe hot news radio six hundred WN\nAnd that's what you want whether it's sunny summer or winter\nThat said damn store dance ... carries ... the number one garage door manufacturer in the U.S and lift master ... vantage the number one garage door opener on the market today\nQualities and defend ability that says it all Jews dance doors in more for the best glow fake commercial industrial in residential doors and lift master opener is on the market today go to Dan stores dotcom [noise]\nYou can't stop ally\nCancel your car when you fall asleep on the medium\nTowers on coming from\n... trial the driving cat off message from the Iowa department of public safety governors traffic safety around in your local law enforcement agencies\nNews talk whether and sports six hundred W.
