M. T.\n...\n... big show [noise]\nI Love about twelve fifty one what would you want a big show clock or by\nWhen the big show Doug Cooper Andy Petersen we're talking insurance right now fellows and uh yeah first shot out of the gun you would think wow you guys talking about insurance a lot of folks cell that well here's a bit of background or talking about today is health insurance\nAnd a member a back to the legislative session the farm bureau was working with the state legislature on a health care program that would be available to a members did so a little bit different a lot of the farm folks have been talking about the need for\nA health insurance and reasonably priced health insurance and so legislature said yup well you can go ahead and put together a plan and we've been waiting for that plan to come out and now it's it's out\nAnd that's what we're talking about today so that's the background that's where all the big hubbub is about here at talk on the health insurance on the big show\nSteve ... with us and Steve you have been a working this morning training or some of the agents is going to be selling this product so I I guess we're going to hear from from the guy who's explaining it\nAnd I want you to explain that to us so ... what what is it that we're talking about and uh the tough Farm Bureau members are going to have a offered to I'm here to kind of start us off shoring\nUp I'd be happy to do that yeah they're all about a hundred and only\nKind of a special place for me 'cause it's about thirty miles from our family farm so it kind of a nice trip up here today but what we're talking about is that when the legislature passed a bill back in twenty eight legislative session which was ...\nIn the law in April which allowed under oath to develop this health benefit plan for its members the you know the Affordable CARE Act created some things in the marketplace help in awful lot of people\nBe able to obtain health insurance but were unable to paint it before but it created some unintended consequences and one of those consequences is there some folks now that that physically because they don't qualify for the tax credits or subsidies underneath the Affordable CARE Act\nI'd been priced out of the market so this plan is really designed to help those folks ah be able to have a a comprehensive renewable benefit plan that that they can afford\nNow are you you're talking about affordable do you have a prices figured in there so if we we call her Farm Bureau guys they can they can quote prices to us\nWell I tell you what I Can't I Can't give you back right obviously that's going to make a difference based on how old you are ... black and all the other thing but\nWhat I can tell you that for the folks that are out there that don't qualify for a for a group plan and therefore they have to buy their own insurance and if they don't qualify for the stuff that we think these these rate will be much more cost effective for them than a\nThan a ... a plant a frankly those folks that are on the the plan that or is he thinks that the subsidies they're probably in the best plan they can possibly be and they should probably stay there but this was really going to appeal to the folks that don't qualify for those tax credits\nNow one thing one requirement is is you have to be a foreign bureau member\nBrecht and ... ... go ahead I'm Sorry not ... I was just asking you that one go ahead\nNo you are correct the legislation basically allowed to offer a plan to our members and says the legislation requires that\nUm we do require you to be a member to apply that hurdle is not ... and you can certainly work with your age and work with your local county Farm Bureau and they can get that set up for you the fairly easy process to do and we certainly encourage folks to do that ahead of time\nWho who's going to be administering this this\nPlan this plan will actually be administered by all while mark administrators and it's just a bit area of Walmart Blue Cross and Blue Shield here in the state of Iowa we work with Wal Mart for decades actually deliver a health plans to our numbers and this is kind of a continuation of that partnership\nNow did you have kind of a a cafe programmer I can pick off a different things that I Need or or do you have different levels or do you have different uh uh you know a deductible price points things like that\nYeah absolutely we will have read different plans available for\nApplicants to look at and make a selection from two of them will look\nKind of like your traditional health insurance plans there used to with co pays for doctor\nVisits and prescription drugs and then secondly or certainly I guess we'll have a what's called a high deductible health plan and that allows folks to ah basically contribute to an age if they don't use those eight to eight dollars to pay\nFor some of that care that they receive so we will have three options out there in in that way the member can select what makes sense for them for their family\nAnd I know we we don't have the details here in front of us but it is it ... is available and all Ninety nine counties and have service there and all Ninety nine counties all hospitals you know things like that I mean that's one of the things we we uh care a lot about out in the countryside is sometimes we're you know we're not near a big city\nAbsolutely and yet it will be available in all Ninety nine counties we're using the Walmart blue HMO network has access every hospital in the state and probably Ninety seven or Ninety eight percent of all the providers in the state you know we know that a health care is the number one priority that our members have\nPulled us was important I Know the ... came out recently over the weekend and kind of said the same thing and the individual health insurance or health care market\nIs only about five to seven percent of the overall population but it disproportionately affects those farm families than a lot of those folks don't have access to those plans do we think this is going to be a good opportunity for to help that group of people who coverage that they needed\nNow one final question here we're going we're gonna let you go we're up against clock too so uh do do you have to sign up at any certain time period eyes got notice here uh we're we're we are that you have a what what do they call the open enrollment period I mean is that a part of this to\nKnow is not the open enrollment period or Iraq plan starts\nOn November one that we ah coincidentally are opening our enrollment up on November one as well however the plans are available to purchase at any point during the year though if folks need something come next February next June whatever it might be they would have the opportunity to purchase that plan then\nWell Steve you've been a world of help to his thank you so much for us spent some time with us today\n... thanks Bob\nAnd we and we'd like to get you out in the field a little bit a maybe a so hopefully things will start drying up for a round there as well about ... and you bet Steve camera with us or he was in training or fellows on the ... going to be selling this new uh insurance program new health insurance program like I said the reason we're talking about on big shows there was a big deal\nThat uh we had been talking about uh that uh uh then the legislative session they want to thank you or to the post ... west commodities also they're one of our\nBig show sponsors Andover like talk about our sponsors and the gang from ag west\nJoined just as a big show sponsor a as well so thanks for those guys actually dug in Andy and Jake for keeping us on time and that the music let you know that to your five minutes away from Rush Limbaugh here in ... stations [noise]\n\n\nReturn on your seat investment from the start within ... protection against past that can cost you at harvest only the revolutionary thrived three D. application system from F.

B.\nI. special agent her best friend for life\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC\nI have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ...

McLean\nNo matter what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\n\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as is the letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she ... about six hundred bucks on\nA\nFord was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel metro have you ever given tips your advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph\nTest never remember when that question was asked I Do think what the hell was this now Senator Grassley\nHas been busy refuting claims made by ... and others Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job as is his staff here\nAt Grassley sent a letter to foreigners attorneys telling them about the ex boyfriend\nSeeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test and has again asked for the therapists notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see\nYeah the polygraph test that Ford took\nAnd Ford's lawyer's have returned that reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to steal the FBI investigation I think they think the case is collapsing and you know what I think\nEvidence of the case collapsing is is New York times story on Trump's taxes\nThat's the first thing I thought when I saw that's New York times story because they've been sitting on this so long the Showtime hasn't been able to prepare a TV documentary on it\nSo Showtime which is owned by CBS\nHas been working with the New York times on this documentary on the supposedly explosive details Trump's taxes and what do we know about Trump's taxes\n\nWell it's a blockbuster story of the day the times reports that Trump's father may have left him more money than anybody knew about\nForty years ago\nAnd the Trump and his siblings set up shell corporations and phony you this is in bad style high and the money from the I.

it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with that this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim is mocking balls the forty\nWasn't mocking are well I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is on except I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find very compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed them out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should happen\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearings committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times has been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story\nOn Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia a tendon for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because in due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a ... storage\nTrump was it Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did was make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names and serve big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now\nActually a reference for somebody somebody and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nThat [noise] a bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people as audiences don't remember the\nClinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all at Johns\nAnd you never know what you do when you got to go to ... what'd you got to come up with what you're not going to you going to come up with the women like New Hampshire not\nGreat but it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kavanaugh protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back\nThis was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting having all where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman\nCassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non collaborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback but it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and uncorroborated charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so that protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\nCassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and that would make sure women heard clearly your care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cathy and I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protester no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically

purpose was um\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what\nShe said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious\nPlaces you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is is it is not mocking Kristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people say this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling I have explained\nThis before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case doctor both before and your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth the other my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump could be that said or I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be critical\nAnd the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held a pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it\nThan will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really\nThinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't\nTrump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did just three years\n\nIn fact it's if it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was the one the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said boy she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nThen be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined can you imagine\nThere was something going on they can you imagine if men organized for the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush\nOr a million women\nOr nor do their search we'd do well\nYeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision a movement of men\nIf if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun of the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nThree quarters November's soybean eight sixty one and a half foreign damp\nDown

Fox News we report you saw [noise]\nNews talk whether and sports six hundred W. M. T.\n[noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the E. V. network books here is the James moved up to the gym and guarantee quotes from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about\nPolitics at all these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting\nThat I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kind of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution\nOr the written baggage is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this uh ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was a and even if it if you can even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party\nLook at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate sick\n... ... in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends it only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend\nOn being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind seeing so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump\nTrump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders\nFrom the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote or what do you think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was skating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not\nThey see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have the ads to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yet\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women the pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this\nThis hold me to get a white ...\n... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was right when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the sex is rape even the sex marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's\nBeen taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine [noise]\nGod if not better right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso right of it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it now that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee\nNeed be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on the lake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know this\nThis may screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate none of blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against Kavanaugh the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hyped camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to look at words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and high camp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even\nMcConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and Cape\n\nBut in their states there's held a pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford and I want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of\nTheirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt the charge here and try not to try and serve a difficult to convey but this is a text chart there is some\nUh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties
