numbers and we're talking about we might get an announcement today that uh could affect either availability or how they're traded guys trade in the renewable fuel numbers there where you are\nNo we don't but I you know I think the issue with them is the fact that you have some a large refiners are them from using brands\nAnd I think the other issue is that some of them are being driven up and people are holding them so the rents are too high so I think that the the real issue and hopefully it looks like we're going to get the house but on a Fifteen and hopefully we see some kind of an announcement on Iran's also so that we get a true\nLevel playing field across the board I think that the issue well\nAnd and and what's going to level the playing field I mean what what do you think we're going to have to hear on that that were inside\nWell I think number one I think that we don't have any exemptions by some of these large refiners that they don't have to use rent so I think that's probably the uh the number one thing that uh you know we'll be looking for at least\nTo start with 'em and so we don't have these exemption so um I think that is it\n... well again that announcement is expected and the next a hour and a half or so and then the president will be following up with more information more news on that I'm sure\nWhen he visits the ... later on this afternoon Andy is standing by there and he's going to be bringing us so all the inside and insight on that list jump back into the marketplace Don rose us ... with us\nDon um what are you looking at is as far as targets I mean we do have big report or or maybe I don't know maybe it's not such a big report coming up this week\nNo it is a big report that because you know what you're going to have in this report a little everything you this is the report that we usually see acre adjustments if we're going to we probably do\nIt is also going to carry the ending a box from last year in this report they were larger remember that\nIt's also going to have to update on yield and then also it's going to give us a better look on what the demand is also going forward so it's got a lot of moving parts in this one and you can get some surprises overall the trades going in with a negative\nView but at the end users are hoping for a negative reports that they can get covered on some of their uh uh supplies at fall harvest so in short term I think that's really the fear that keep the weight on soybeans along with the hope that the weather clears out here we get back to harvest\nSo negative report what kind of numbers you are you looking for\nWell I think the yield uh first of all I mean on a corn and soybeans both a half a bushel maker dialed into the market now so if it would be happened to be over that as you approach a bushel and her um and I think on the ending stock\nIf uh you know right now are looking for the ending stock to go up about fifty million on corn and beans so if they'd be closer to a Seventy five hundred\nUm that would be a issue on the demand side\nI think what we're looking for is the government gonna jump and push the ethanol UC up anticipating that he Fifteen or change we will see that's probably fifty to a hundred billion bushels of a more demand but then look at the world's supply and the once a year for Russia's corn crop comes\nDown and a a an adjustment on some of those things\nWill ... got about a minute here Don or less what what what did you see in the um harvest report here yesterday\nWell on the harvest a you know we think it's

people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this I\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the

and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party cried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acting on concerned on an interest in and would\nAlways say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies\nYou can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it yeah it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing because\nThere's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixty\nIn Hillary couldn't do it ever\nBut certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't\nDraw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you that they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy\nAnd that'll be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got\nTo try it they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even\nGiven it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide\nDamien toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall\nIt's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the actual title of the show\nIt will feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing issues of\nThe day and looking toward the future the tour is being sponsored by live nation\nThere's even more rain let's go over the max to right now if we can and you'll notice that back west of interstate thirty five there is a very very large range shield I'm no severe weather in that but plenty of rain in fact as we put it into motion you noticed that north or slightly northeastern motion to that\nThat's what's moving our way as we head through the remainder of the overnight hours into the morning there's a cold front and area of low pressure to be passing through the area with that low pressure close to us that's producing enough spin in the atmosphere right now to allow those thunderstorms to develop and that rotations and develop when that happens\nThat once again when we find that\nPotential that we could see a tornado in a storm as it moves off toward the north and the storm certainly does have some of that rotation in it\nAs we're watching it across areas in ... county father to the west is just some rain that cold front will move through the areas we had to tonight into tomorrow the heavy rain threat will be done will actually break this weather pattern need a couple of dry days ahead but we do have\nOh probably another twenty four hours or so or to deal with some rain as well as a potential for heavy rain and severe weather from now all the way into the morning hours tomorrow heavy rain will be the threat especially as we head through the overnight hours is a whole range shield moves are way\nAs we take a look right now at a storm reports that we've seen across the area and there have not been many I'm In Iowa as this whole system has been moving through but we'll take a look what we've got heavy rain is kind of the main reports in the last twenty four hours\nOr you certainly see that back off to the south and west of Cedar Rapids\nNear interstate eighty just west of Oscar loose and also notice last night to tornadoes are three tornado reports\nOff to the northwest of Des Moines and off to the south east of Des Moines I'm just north as we can see of highway thirty four I did at one confirmed the F. one in Clark County as that storm moved through last night\nSo again the nature as isolated but it is possible and we've seen it across eastern Iowa all the past several weeks these storms through very brief tornadoes it may only be on the ground for a very short period of time maybe a tenth of a mile or maybe less than that\nWith that in mind I'm it needs to be taken seriously and that's why we are on the air a no additional warnings in eastern Iowa one additional severe thunderstorm warning across areas of\nSouthwest Wisconsin I'm as we cross the cross grand county uh two areas of concern though that we are continuing to watch and that's why we're staying on the air right now I'm until three PM or that storm leaves and moves into across the Mississippi and the grant county we have a severe thunderstorm warning in effect\nFor portions interview county this is off to the north west of the city of Dubuque want to stress Dubuque has never been included in this warning and indeed um has not been included in the warning because the storm is said well to the west in addition we have a severe thunderstorm warning that continues down across extreme south western areas ... county\nUm again this is not include the city of Oscar loose sets off to the west of Oscar loose of moving right along that may I ask the county line right now as it heads off to the north again also about thirty miles per hour let's go ahead and put a storm track once again on that sell 'em\nHasn't moved to the north little pause it here for you I'm Corey as long as I'm getting a storm tracks at any uh reports that you've seen any type of things you're watching on radar right now with particular interest as these storms continue to move off to the north are nothing new in terms of official reports\nHe's had some storms fighters or other people on the ground around the storms that storm interview county still does show some characteristics of rotation especially around the records they'll area right now\nAnd so it's definitely less organized than it was both in the way it looks on the radar and as we're looking at well behind the scenes information\nI wouldn't do stress that that threat definitely continues around the records they'll area help move north end of the accounting toward ball town on other storms across eastern Iowa still looking fairly disorganized on scattered storms across much of the teen I Do an area especially the central part\nUh at this hour up and no signs of severe weather of out of those as of yet\nSo that

cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think then tower got scared because he

[noise]\nThis is for Delaware county if you take highway Thirteen and go to the north as almost the western border of this warning heading toward the east toward Earl ville this does include the city of Ryan Manchester and the city of Earl built in addition we have a tornado warning father to the south that tornado warnings in effect for portions of Benson in Iowa accounting\nThat's in effect until helped me out again kind this warning that three forty five forty five that's against proportion of ... and and I was so this would be the northern port or the western portion of our county the southern portion of Benson county as far as cities it would be boarded them in the north by the city of van horn\n... do you are included in this warning of Blair's town as well as belt plane that storm also moving off to the north the north east about thirty five miles per hour\n[noise] uh right now let's go over to max to real quick will get the velocity data on both of these\nAnd then we're going to do you do is I'll I'll kick it back to you all we get some of the city can dial up here uh this is an Iowa county right here so the velocity data does suggest that this thing is starting to ramp up a little bit here and it's intensity so there it is right there that's the rotation right in there we have the green on one side read on the other\nThe motion on this has generally been up towards the north northeast we are where we got to tornado warnings that are in place we're going to get to Delaware county in a moment\nThis is one thing it's way towards again the north northeast this would put it either directly into the door up or perhaps in between the door and marine go either way if you're anywhere within that\nReally from door to wrangle a this is a a system that is that's conducive of getting these thunderstorms the spin a earlier we did not have any reports on this uh but we'll see what winds up happening with this particular storm sell this rotation looks a little bit more well defined than the other\nFarther up towards the north we've got a very similar looking signature on radar going on just to the east of the Ryan areas Joe just mentioned just east of highway Thirteen so there's the center of circulation there this one a little more broaden here with the green on the right read up towards the top the\nMotion on this is the towards the north northeast as well about thirty to thirty five miles an hour\nThat would be moving up towards the Manchester area perhaps just to the east to Manchester but you know what there is no reason the chance that from Manchester the Dell high to Earl ... you're in the warning or we didn't want you to be in that very same story with Ryan as well uh the way this thing is rotating at this time\nYou want to just drive again kind will go through those two velocity pounders again I'm just going to go to the wall again to explain it was all available to us\nWalls available so again with ... referring to first of all and what you look and we'll go to the south warning for the portions of Iowa as well as Benson county this warning in effect until three forty fives of both the next half hour or just go\nThere you know a bluff notice the low door here's the rotation in the storm itself and ... is going to drive for us right near interstate eighty right now green indicates movement back toward and read indicates moving away so we have rotation in this area near the Geneva bluff area\nThat is right along gee avenue is mentioned that would take it right up to the door in addition a tornado warning is also in effect for\nDelaware county this does include the city of rye in the city of Manchester we're going to move to the north and you'll notice as you look across the other pattern that you're seeing it's all red and as long as it stays that way\nThat's really what we're looking for its way to get the reds greens together and the right direction again very near Ryan right now and it was right here this moving away this is moving towards the heavy rotation in this area that is just south of two hundred and Seventy fifth street\nUh just off towards the city of Ryan shift to the east now of highway Thirteen and again that's just off to the northwest of ... creek just down to the southwest of del high noticed that northward movement is going to take it farther up to the north toward highway twenty and eventually toward the city of Manchester as well want to stress\nWe have no confirmation these or rain or indicated rotation in the store and this is where a tornado could be president or could come out as a result in these areas you do need to be in your safe place will be running down those safe areas but again\nIt was kind of one on her own on the rotation in the area for you\nUm once again we will take a look\nAt pinpoint Doppler radar which again will show us the showers and storms moving across the area they're very isolated in nature we have to sell so we're working on right now one is that tornado warning that goes into three forty five this would be for areas of northern Iowa as well as southern areas of Benton county western areas of Iowa county on does not include this\nNew home fan of warning and Keystone about three forty five and as you heard a joke or would you say on the TV on whether lab they are holding the ... community kids are so they are right around their school dismissal and that means that they're being held now back to coverage from TV not from\nFlorida governor Rick Scott with a dire warning to those who don't pay attention to the guidance from\nLast time we took the camera because it's moving north northeast it's moving this way right here and so\nWhat we're going to wind up doing here is I've got the camera control in my left hand and in my right hand I've got the city can display so we'll see how this goes here but we're going to try and found this here as it goes across the area and obviously it's obscured by and falling rain\nTo an area that looks very similar to what we had in marine do though with a small localized lowering ah we've not had any reports off this either but there's enough there that would suggest that this thing still has some rotation\nPheromone schools ALSO Holding a students as well just heard that let's go back to max one right now take a look at the velocity product and again reds greens important to us read moving away from the radar site green moving toward the radar site\nIn this case the radar site is in Davenport here's where we noticed that rotation has mentioned just off to the west or west of Earl veil\nJust often the eastern city of Manchester\nThat rotating part of the storm wishes along highway thirty eight to stop to the south of the night of the area we're watching very very carefully um that could be an area again that could lead to tornadic formation I Want to stress at this time and all the warnings and we've had\nWe have not had any tornado reports normally a damage reports which is exactly what we would like to see however you do need to be in your safe area if you are in these spots because that rotation is there and as we showed you\nI'm very quickly you can see followed cloud develop wants to touches down it could certainly be causing some damage the certainly something we need to be aware of quick revive view of the safety rules once again nominate will take a look at our city cans which have been following both of these storms very very carefully\nTornado warning situation for areas of Benton county Iowa county as well as Delaware county stay away from windows and doors lowest floor you can get to under something sturdy cover your head with a helmet pillow or blankets\nAgain away from windows and doors I really want to stress that as many walls between yourself and the storms possible get to a closet a hallway or bathroom and again cover your head as best you can\nMany ways to follow us for severe weather coverage that includes of course the TV nine first alert whether apple we're streaming are severe weather coverage\nIn addition we are also streaming at ... dot com many radio partners as well pick up our feed and we'll get that out to you as well so there's many ways into a storm shelter you can take that information with you so you can stay informed of course Facebook Twitter will have a lot of information on it as well including\nThat possibility that we could see some damage reports we do appreciate those damage reports but certainly be safe as those reports are moving through wanna run down once again for your the warnings that we have an effect that will jump back to the weather lab and check in with\nMeteorologist Corey Thompson to see if anything that we found a continuing to watch there is a new tornado warning that just came out this is just outside of the TV nine viewing area you noticed that's just the southwest new city of ... so again looks like it's going to continue to be a very active afternoon to warnings\nNorthern areas of Iowa now into southern areas of bent and county will pinpoint that warning first it is now crossing highway to twelve just off the west of the city of marine go those of you just to the west a marine go and Blair's town certainly be on the lookout for the storm as it continues to move to the north\nThat north toward movement will take it right along the twenty first avenue in El lane a very new lose earn as well as crossing Seventy seven street as we head up toward Blair's town movement on that storm has been off to the northeast at about thirty five miles per hour so let's go ahead and stop the radar for you and let's put a storm track on it\nAnd we'll go again north in about thirty five miles per hour skiing when those communities will be affected as that storm continues to move through the rotation itself as we said just west of the city of Durango we've been following it very carefully on our Ringo city camp hum and continue to follow it will certainly give you an update on our city came coming up and just a minute\nI'm heading part about three forty Blair's down about three forty six van horn it would be in your area at three fifty seven again and eat in about four twelve that's the first tornado warning in effect and that's in effect until three forty five\nIn addition we have a tornado warning that is also in effect farther to the north this is across the Delaware county and as the weather service Washington these storms move through your latest a shape inexpensive that warning is changing that's the piling on warning system that we've been watching it looks like the rotation and this storm now\nI'm just off to the north\nEast of the city of Manchester also just off toward the northwest and the city of rural ville that's the cell were most concerned with right now this would be along highway thirty eight\nMovement on his cell has also been off to the northeast right around thirty five miles per hour we'll go ahead and pinpoint the storm for you as well um give you an indication of exactly where that rotation isn't very narrow night it right now that's a kind of the area you want to really be really be watching for I'm On a hundred and Seventy street\nI'm up to about a hundred and fifty a straight as we head toward Greeley swimming very very cautious in those areas that's where the rotation as in the storm that again can lead to tornadic formation as he put a storm track on it for you\nUm again just south of Oneida will move off to the north again in about thirty five miles per hour that puts it you know night at three thirty seven so that's pretty close to the next couple of minutes ... three forty to Alice park at three forty seven twin bridges park at three forty nine would that arrives at three fifty one again\nScattered areas of showers and storms dominate the weather picture right now across all of eastern Iowa this will be the case as we head through the evening hours and with that several of the storms heavy rotation in them and that's why the tornado warning has mission here I was just calling Thompson is back in our weather lab and Corey um what are you finding out there right now\nOnce again it's still not a lot of reports but seeing the same thing that you guys are up there at the desk a lot of areas of rotation in Delaware county that storm still looks pretty strong near Oneida\nNorthwest of Earl ville that as if you're a question just to make sure to know that are made sure that everyone knows what we're talking about when we say a tornado warning that means that the storms do have the capability of producing tornado right now so if you're inside of tornado warning area\nPlease do get here safely seek shelter don't wait for the sirens go off those are there to warn people that are outdoors about conditions in their area but if you are seeing that's on TV Now in your in these areas under warnings please do seek shelter in the basement or the lowest area of your home that you can\nAh let's take a look at our Manchester City can because we have to city can that have been following these rotating thunderstorms a fairly fairly rapidly here this ... this afternoon\nA Manchester looking it's way off towards the east north east of what we're seeing right here [noise]\nUh this was looked like a pretty broad lowering earlier right in here and this has come up a little bit what we're seeing out in here that torrential rain fall there off towards the east north east now the other storm cell that we've been following very carefully has a has been in the ... area and a quite an interesting feature now to a moving just to the west at marine go here\nAnd that's still continued lowering I write in the center of the screen there it's moving north it looks like at least thirty five miles an hour and that this is the same area of rotation we're watching earlier from the other side\nOf where the cameras site was at so now we just kind of flip that around and follow this and they continue to some of its way off towards the north so uh this is an interesting one to watch this has had a history of producing a brief funnel cloud we caught that live on the air a little while ago and uh if it's going to do anything it's going to happen right in this general vicinity here\nWith the marine corps city can a pointed the way that it is to keep an eye on this as it moves its way off towards the towards the north northeast here this afternoon\nThere's also a ... I think we have an additional tornado warnings [noise] let's see where this is for I was just going to say maybe watch for extension an ex extension there it's coming from a senior at the same storm you're watching right out of it as an awfully low\nCloud based right there and there's just enough rotation here and this has had a history of producing some finals and I want to walk everybody through where that one's going to go here\nBack on max one we now have an extension of the tornado warning this will be an sex in effect for far northern in North western areas of Iowa county\nThe good share of Vinton County this includes Blair's Townes van horn as well as the city of Vincent um you notice that box has now been extended farther off to the north end it or the northern boundary was near van horn now the northern boundary is the city of events and how can use check movement real quick 'cause it's still a movement at thirty five miles per hour\nUh yeah we'll get the number here in a moment what was that of course [noise]\nTwenty five miles per hour so slow down site and so I Want to give you an accurate depiction of the a\nStorm itself and kind of when it's going to move through your area you want to let you know that whirlpool employees are are being held as well I'm against the storm passes through the area's just to make sure that\nEverything is a is fine for them to get out on the road as well as remember get on the road at these storms I'm you're really going to have to be watching very very carefully as well as those storms continue to move through because\nUm even if they're not severe they could contain some torrential rains and something we certainly need to watch for as all these slums move through just want to pull up the velocity proud of the kind of give you a better area to\nTo pinpoint of where that is\nUm how's it looking at them Ringo city can right now\nSame story as it was earlier we can jump on a ... to real quick here and this is the tornado warning extension that was out and so now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "09"}
