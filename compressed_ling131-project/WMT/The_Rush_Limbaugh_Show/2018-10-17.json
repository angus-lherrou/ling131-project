because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool he didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\n... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about the show he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it has ever watching here you come\nBlowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible there is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to

people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know that watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone or the watch can access that I find that

just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's most of the day they say the show was recorded the events of after recorded on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the\nDissipating blue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary\n[noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open are mentally and he had done it Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ...\nBill and I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nIdled scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming there's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here exactly my point the impact of the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republican\nSo the media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nRock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned them shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what we're rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou'd think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue wave or why are you still hear me [noise] oh yeah I got a ... couple stories Democrats worse Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because of the blue wave is not a walk\nAnd that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mom and doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have coattails it's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in the right he campaigned for Hillary two thousand sixteen remember how he did it do you want\nA third term of mud ... if you want me simply couldn't turn it off do you vote for Hillary at what happened did\nAnd all this Trump was the ... not Hillary Rodham running them and\nSo he's not there\nAll falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's\nI don't know I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the AP pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they do about\nIt here's how the story begins facing the prospect of rules electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is\nThere any other kind of interview the wide ranging you think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever have one of those [noise] [noise]\nNo they're always a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor did for mid term losses\nOr view of the outcome is a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcripts of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one\nHey Pete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that\nNo I think I'm helping people look I'm forty\nEight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor many many races and I will say\nThat we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people I've endorsed have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in no way in that state does Donald Trump say he doesn't even addressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that premise a pie offers it\nFamily him excellent moon I hardly ever buy any groceries and the employee on there and yes just as normal nicely\nIt's a good life at Windsor manner

Don moment is wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I got to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's though the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms would lower it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nFor ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one reason was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that\nDemocrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself he put in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn your preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can ever remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I don't I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even\nTry to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shock geo right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nFrustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're real\nA ... you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national oppressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who were doing their best to hide out and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it with me it was me other countries so [noise] so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and that you know like your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a law why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nTo you [laughter]\nYeah but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs are in a ... wage is going up or my ... my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not cherry coke was surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nTo take a break but there has to have to say rush probably ... being met for\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one

I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in\nAny editor says you don't run me you don't control me\nAnd it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it and the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you would have to be if your job is destroying people no conscience\nThe belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this is the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor now I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much\nUh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm that Peter file story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't\nHave the guts to run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it just

going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's faster because it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's bad hit everybody everybody as a rubber made including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um I I

O.\n\n\nWelcome back okay back to the phones we go I I I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of like here\nIs that CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back for Strategic\nReasons and still think there is going to be what I Am I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this\nBut we'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi in a Damien nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me when I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms and not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh\nI don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the flight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell\nYou is for what it's worth there is\nIn in the in the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections I mean ... even five at this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did\nIt out I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written the regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman lay procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales up justice arm line the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election\nNow the Hillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures depending on their careers dependent on it and she was a democratic nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again ... seizing the unwritten regulations not impacting the elections so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler Remy to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian\n... Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what that is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not well let's play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does\nThat's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion I don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen\nNever Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the garden yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIt would love to be able to uh to\nDiscredit a whole bunch of like the tariffs and what it's doing to trade the problem is reality the reality on the ground if the if if if the if the numbers are\nAre referring to that extent it just isn't going to jibe with reality\nAnd it's and it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises they've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing double crossing porn star is that they're calling a horse

wanting perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\nIf you all women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about a duo at ... ... what porn star double crossing\nBack stabbing\nWoman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to him\n\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning pure as the driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like\nOne of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term\nHorse face when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find that to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick take ... take your pick any left wing or on media griping about\nTrump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the\nPresidency [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way\nMy point is they can try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters Shannon in fact that there's so much good\nGoing on here focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut he did\nOr also gonna they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists is in the Saudi conflict is ...\n... a ... a shaggy they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here\nUh it's about Trump's approval

of a Saudi journalist we've asked for it if it exists adding it probably does and insisting he's not trying to provide cover to the Saudis but\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys have not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places\nPeople there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her\nMocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence\nAnd it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump did that and cause the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan a lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is she has no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it just started ... she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend\nOther than by partisans and that\nWas the turning point in Kavanaugh came in and of course his his re testimony is ria parents was a subtle factor number a whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels\nAnd the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the\nMedia invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around that Dr buyers were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit so\nIn one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not\nGuilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her in fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\n\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring\nThat the stripper porn star andme in order to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse race in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump\nIs embarrassing goes they stopped talking about people that way so it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tank or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says well if you were reasonably so that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible American public shame township rising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she knows no evidence blah blah by\nThe Trump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not\nReporting of being Trump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to

[noise]\nThe so called Washington Post journalist Jim off your shopping [noise]\nMy question is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what has it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed\nNot confirmed so much they'll likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recordings ... knew what was in store for a minute ... watching the recording this stuff and it was somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern\nAnd remember Hillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world\nFor Americans were allowed to be murdered in ...\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for his CNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here\nAnd again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is to people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front\nDoor with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors\nDid you know that\nDr ball the foreign had two doors that something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nIt had to do with the Google employees reading this\nWait a minute it was a five hundred square foot plates and two front door is ... ... ...\n\nI've ever Google employer's going back and they have their own separate front door oh well that's that's a big difference than meeting at four claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years\nWell anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door in every window is what's important\nTo feel safe inside now how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was his name was fairly expensive and then simply say palm security came along offering a solution\nTo protect all of your doors and windows and the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology and the systems they make\nThey use wife ... folks to connect all of these components together the sensors on the doors and windows the HD cameras the motion detectors the glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary base station in the house my wife I certainly wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to get I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife I connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their centers in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals when doors and windows are open\nAnd if you arm you're simply save system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or are there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested in pre configured\nAll you have to do is installing or get something they're happy as no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not
