harbors progress reports come out weekly or what what do you think ah ... how are we doing out there are you surprised\n[noise] well I I think we're going to see a lot of improvement a lot of progress this week if you you were to wet in the western corner eastern corn belt was cruising by law all hard for us to see 'cause we're sitting out here in the weather area but\nAh yeah wheels turning today guys when they actually were going for like around but uh the longer this a dry spell continues they'll get down into low grounded I think beans will show pretty rapid progress once they get into\nYeah Alan and you've always been told us is the same thing is don't look out your window and think that the entire world we and we we get that but uh how are things come along in the Dakotas they've had to been rougher whether we maybe even than what we have in mid west\n[noise] yeah they they've got some reports of beans are flat and on the ground because they got too much though on them but ah I've also got clients up there say no but are you a potential still there uh\nYou know they're they're looking at some record deals in some cases so again it's it's getting it out the the problem up there of course is the the case biz are terrible the basis is horrible because you know get the west coast market just doesn't exist right now without China\nYeah a talk about that that bases map I was watching looking at that the other day and I thought holy cow these basis or a huge cheer you think we're going to see those a narrow down a little bit\nYeah I think you'll see improvement your typical post harvest improvement a nationally you'd expect about Fifteen cents on beans or at least ten to twelve cents on corn between the October low in in the first of December\nSo uh I I think you'll see that I think the bases will uh beans is going to be worse than your ego all year just because of the carry over if I mean if we're looking at twenty percent stocks use ratio\nYou're just not going to see the typical basis uh it'll be fairly regional though the the uh the upper Midwest still have to drain down into the Gulf just like everybody else is trying to do\nThat until we get some kind of resolution on that Asian trade\nWell yeah we're we're draining down I understand going out the Gulf but I think some of those being going out the Gulf maybe back door on their way into China I don't know that for sure uh like I say I've I've only heard rumors that some of the south American beans may have an awful lot of American taste in so\nUh hey what what are we looking at for targets Alan what do you think about the core and going forward here and soybeans\n[noise] but I think the short run a resistance on corners three Seventy seven we we still think

that George Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way\nAnd the magic of the Taliban is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan\nAnd that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I haven't had one made the baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had\nOne of those made than those bother you baby ... rush maybe\nOn ... exactly when a rush maybe on board little inside ... yellow site we made it up and it was

we have the\nMueller report as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd this former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what helped Democrats\n\nThat's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting the man I go there has to me what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of\nThing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nAnd it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just thick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them an entry or to separate the children from the adult\nSo that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can where these people will say they're shocked that came to America to save their lives were their children and do improve their latest days of all let the man is is unlike anything they ever heard about\nThe costs of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats\nThink this\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nWe don't have anybody on either side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt just making patently obvious what it is is there a lot of people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated its plan this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother\nReport that\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go I went through yesterday what the what the hope here is\nUh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nBy the we can't do it before the election because of regulations in this instance of where we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go and watch them all up and doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if mothers ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the\nJustices refined lease sounds I hear [noise] that puts this in perspective hang on one look at this [noise] it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd\nHe is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\n\nHe's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from other going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the diagnosis I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nOkay so this\nIs where is this going the ... report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump\nIs none none of which is probably going to be in title none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt for ... not the indictments\nWhich\nThere's nothing left they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that\nBlamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being sold in over his head\nThat it looked like the Russians have worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing

recording\nOf the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friends this is\nItem number one but a rousing as my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ... out there called apple insider this tech blog\nHas been misappropriated as a source for this in certain on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story\nSo whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by a show these apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name hasn't been\nMisappropriated and has been falsely\nAccused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly and here's why the the apple watch angle of this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago when apple at well actually a fourteen month when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the ...\nIn the habit operate it would still get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self certainly didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch failed to do that just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to\nAnd why fight\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch in data can leave a watch you take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey that there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watched they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there was only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his wheat by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against\nOther nations being able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protection is that an embassy would have to protect itself from just like there's no is it that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\n\nBut that one only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on one\nJust because the phone connects the wife five when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fi network because of the phone it's parents who uses it then like if you're at home or your ... your your phone is\nInside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think the show he did that like he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they wouldn't give him the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi constantly wife I Know the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the

should've said that oh darn it why didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something on a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a\nCall here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs we thought Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well back camp that camp that does it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs\nAnd that's why yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left are crazed or\nMaking doing good job of making themselves look that way so I have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that would have papa pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video\nTaken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose\nAnd there was this guy\nDemonic looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then the ripping it to shreds\nAnd at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera and got this demonic for ... look on his face\nStarts shouting to the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken still shut up put it up there and this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards\nAnd this still shot here storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera he actually got within two inches of the camera I did is still shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow\nAspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion\nIs all too real so I'm trying to wonder why when the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion they want you to know\nThey want readers to know this western is by
