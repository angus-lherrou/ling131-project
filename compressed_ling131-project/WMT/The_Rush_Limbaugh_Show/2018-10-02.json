Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nMe remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race you had videotape of a horse race that nobody obscene and it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave bats and wages on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that want to check stopped sit at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets has the final turn ... stops the tape but the horse racing again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of\nOnes they've made players do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you're doing you're making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time third quarter and do your job\nSame thing here holes in January\nIn front of a November election doesn't mean anything\nPolls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been\nAnswered none ... zero NATO\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they have all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave\nIn the Senate but wave red\nWave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine\nWent viral and drive by loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting on Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\n\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that be limber on just said they were gonna lose they are totally\nTotally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that'll fire buddy I Know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning\nThe capital nomination now let's go to further news at ... some of this from the hill dot com red state Democrats face nightmare scenario on cabinet\n\nThis article shows beyond doubt that Democrats are brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce cabinet\nYou realize the latest defense the New York times has run the story saying that Brett Kavanaugh through ice on a ... bar patron back in his days if you ate all\nHe threw ice this\nGoes to show just how on fit for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is of course the New York times when learning that Bill Clinton told Juanita Broderick\nPut a little ice on your lips Bab while walking out of the room after allegedly raping her\nThey thought that was not worthy of being published are printed that was enough to that I mean put some ice on that live there that that no news there\nBut Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly on a ... page would stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualify\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope ultimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have just just like the mother investigation\nMurder investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers that Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support\nIn Washington by Republicans have they can get his approval numbers now that the twenties because they succeeded make everybody think Trump treated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there's no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the mother investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with him\nWhat they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign\nFrom the nomination withdraw or the force Trump to withdraw that and the way they still hope that they can force capital out\nA second Democrat is from the article here to heal docked on the second Democrat

going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I show you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against it\nWas only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but CNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still at four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed it angry voices on the road for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge in the White House automation a correction claiming no we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't the by the way\nMore evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick\nThat was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nMaybe there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine an artist than his\nCartoonish interpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fire was a no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public at the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it\nSwitched that show this to the people watching other that'll camp this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the

do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually a Rush Limbaugh dot camera if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for

despicable ended sick and of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people have seen it people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\n\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabinet his daughter says another prayer\nDear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some\nPoint in their
