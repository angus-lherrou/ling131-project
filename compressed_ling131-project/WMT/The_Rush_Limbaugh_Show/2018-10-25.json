say to your daughter you know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily

decency it's something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something that feels very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis\nThat matters we simply can't take out and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and\nHe says uh you know ... they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it
