Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation starter is all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does mean\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing we have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the\nWay it was founded in the snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nHell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced\nThat Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak or does that would be some kind of medication and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is if somebody is running a scam or name a sex scandal of something that's\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him of some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically and tell these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed Mahler has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nSpite the factor in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant rising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many\nMonths maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story\nThat both sides are participating in the news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there\nSo they're turning they always do do other things we also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advised\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the Oprah is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what was your name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah\n\nYou think she was helpful why\nI Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still won despite what the offer was doing ...

today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can jockey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not\nFor me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary\nEvidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and have been for a while to energize everybody who is\nNot a white man they're using the victim allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be right medic continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that notice\nHow quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nIncidents these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any\nRole in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you in the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nGeneral General David Dinkins ... that are fifty four where are you parity yes indeed that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia\nCNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where did I go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nThat hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when it's time to time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just uh remember seeing them go on Wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last\nPlace out there and uh this was that was pre Trump and the ...\nThe belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is light blue eye balls are below the\nTV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it is a damn thing where is it Don\nLemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that and I'm surprised\nWell okay so ... ... but they they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success\nIs to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what I Want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning morning the headline news headline news\nThey just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program and\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually any ... many people especially it was a brand new planet or\nWhether you're such a brand new playing what kind of play it was a bully what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be one of the um you know somewhat of a and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the streets sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest um upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd\nNot as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed entered the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... or so\nThere's no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nRush

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade\nOn this as one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs it why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great\nPiece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford what her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody the cabinet was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets ... give the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all it just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other democratic leaders wanted to have any credibility in all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt for which they were willing to destroy a man\nWhy they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kevin ... did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeach in Canada where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin all of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually\nTelling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of Kevin on but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made public thing I'm terrified here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it\nThat was convenient his whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office if you have these debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nThis Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted people need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost located we got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways\nJust to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nWhen I when I had I heard them as a as a sponsor and I had to do with official welcome when I heard that because it really is a stunning I have no idea such a thing was even possible but it is now people have asked me to Russia one of the apple watch\nOnly ever watch is going to do the same thing is that they have an activated the feature yet the way it's going to work in the apple watch\nAnd it's only the series for you gotta have the brand new apple watch it will not work on all of them so it's not going to be as widespread as the of the cardio device here can be K.

image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much ... when my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is one ... millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by it the ship especially looking after I used to take a device him like open up\nThe upper islet and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want anyone could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that sat I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one have you on the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will have a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about it kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was hurt because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it he's not gonna learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nA survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in referenced Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so\nOver Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were a much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth\nAnd it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness we we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be American they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nPut you in their lives really are on the line at your vote is crucial on Tuesday November ... please

Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\n\nAnd I got to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mitten terms and her final stretch\nAnd I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone is meant in terms of their final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is and how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and Fifteen majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority\nBut this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that paid the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst enough final week of the election why\nWe just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my words not Mr trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided\nVoters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get the job or a ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's given you every reason in the world is ... ... you can think of where they're not that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec uh in New\nYork's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that's\nJust a very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise]\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but it's never craft run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related are the errors\nMeaning cover liable arms on the lake\nAnd then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we now is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day\nLargely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so we're going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate goal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this not just the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens we are well set up for such an eventuality bottom line I happen to the slightest idea what's going to happen\nBut my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea\nNo idea but dressing up with as much intelligence in analysis you can muster\nOr from Google ... under the under the guy is that what what did they say it is it's\nA it's a [noise]\nI ...
