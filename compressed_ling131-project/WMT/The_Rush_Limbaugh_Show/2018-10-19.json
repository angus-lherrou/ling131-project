connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike Hong Kong is gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women want to see up nobody's saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or

media\nFanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain popular\nNew York post New York post just published headline migrant caravan heading for us turns around and Mexico\nYou've seen this anywhere else\nI have it's not on

their cell phones cell phone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way way back ... back you go\nI I've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income complex caved on and I think that\nYou've done this at this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nAh that that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAs all the time so are you are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that if he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding lose own\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has been on foot wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right on the moon right there that\nWas for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we\nDemocrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nThe leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and that there's a lot of other things\nThat they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of them are in the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea\nThat Trump was not to be gone or a before now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help them because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story\nOn the caravan turning around ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince you flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the messenger ...\nOn the world's number one selling tractor my hand ... six point for nine percent a PR financing now through December thirty first twenty Eighteen senior dealer or major usa dot com for more information\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive a hindrance today at Black Hawk rentals in Cedar falls or visit Black Hawk rental dot com that's Black Hawk rental dot com\nPrices for peace building so he's not a good windows doors ... attention on business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can now save a\nTon of money and own your own building with the incredible sale prices from general steel it's right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting space from others just go eight eight eight forty one steal to see how general steel can help you save money our fifty years structural warranty buildings are\nCustom designed for your needs you can get a forty my sixty foot building for less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty by one hundred clear span building under forty thousand dollars there's a new wasted space in construction takes half\nThe time called eight eight forty one steel strong construction spending in high demand this special pricing will not last long cold eight eight eight forty one steel and get your options pricing package and\nDozens of building options ... eighty eight forty one steel and see how general steel can save your money ... eight eight forty one steal that Haiti date for one seven eighty three thirty five eighty eight for one seven eighty three thirty five\n\nRight down to the concept by Iowa hearing aids centers to talk to you about the football season and all those games on television for which I was having trouble hearing the announcers and how hearing aids helped\nIf this is a problem you're having I'd encourage you to do what I did make an appointment with one of the twenty Iowa concept locations near you and have your hearing checked and perhaps change your life like I did\nHave you just go through your free no obligation hearing screening by October thirty first and you need hearing support you can get seven hundred and fifty dollars off each new concept hearing a plus three years of free batteries\nYou get into a concept by Iowa hearing aids center near you by calling each seven seven to nine old four or five oh I'm telling the old fuel roll call or some job you know it's down to drop its high and offered so far no if it's good ... kicking the\nWinning goal against Michigan the seven seven to nine or ... for five hundred W.

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio salvage ship you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming through your elbow quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing\nAll day long to get people's reaction I still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew that but there's four hundred and thirty five\nI don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively this process if I put you on the spot production that we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite lit up\nThe Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to a famed Republicans strategic wrist and Rollins about my comment than\nDeserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house for very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his or her scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those but I Do I mean I run a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those in the open seats has another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats to replace Tony ... everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that as a result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes those rights and times it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work\nAnd we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a\nPrayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates in them [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop\nRejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done to one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting insanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump\nSentiment in a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went over like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America they have in ... dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest that trend voting against Democrats has reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nCome up no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think that they're coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes of the people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve Hilton who has a week at a show on Fox and he was\nInstrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason when one was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single poll out for the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo for this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after\nNot too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree with him a I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think there's a lot of people not being contacted up

great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call\nUm I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great was probably one that shows that you ever hacked and we're really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their\nYou know start a business is you know small businesses and talk about\nHow they're doing you know and where they are and\nSo yeah yeah you don't you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a that was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and ask what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat\nAnd positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean it was like my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day thinking that that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people people would buy 'em\nWell don't don't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still a whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that\nAn operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but um it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories\nOf people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that\nWeek and I'm not I don't have any self doubt\nSo I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally so don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in\nIn ... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi how're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting a member of these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen these done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get\nOn the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "19"}
