...\nThat it sprang alive as a category one and the national Hurricane Center you know this thing is it's looking very bad nobody was paying much attention to it and then all of a sudden it's a cat

involved here\nUm you know what Hillary Clinton went out\nThe other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted everything I have been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and get her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be unsettled and she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition\nThe Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see in all of this in all of this\nCrazy they're ranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist I haven't heard\nOne elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it\nI haven't heard one be elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back\nI haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in the battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of American not\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted\nAll of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system\nFor themselves and their families and their descendants and they didn't care about minorities

going to be for whatever reason they started to scare everybody get them to evacuate or what have you\nUm\nPeople deal with these in different ways who live in areas and have experience dealing with

against black burn right uh what in the media say the media said record turnout rent current voter registration after Taylor Swift\nHow many people bought that that is such a ... there's no way to measure that that's wishful thinking but the reason I bring\nThis up and I don't know Taylor Swift from a pile of coal\nI don't know that you can put a bag of nowhere in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in ...\nNow a story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in ratings well how\nCan it be if she is generating massive record voter registration\nAnd then the host the television show an all time low record ratings don't miss it I don't have one the other but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of nor I'm saying\nThat's how it significant but I'm just a drive\nBy trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate for you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell what I read that or not he's still in writes pieces for the for they hold uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill dot com had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama and one of the most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in respect the Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance at Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done but\nMostly is already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or reversed myself\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that\nDemocrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue way aims it's a moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible of Democrats again only ... seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republican dominant\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate there's even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\n... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUse the excitement you think you see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies use some house the division\n\nMy point is again do\nNot fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News for a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling\nData that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative\nSuburban women and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six in as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got to dial it back we got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were ... or they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all depressed that Trump quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the track coms are attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nOf ... wants a whim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party that when they try and come to or not our friends at China calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate\nAnd triumph over a ... I don't want to be a part of the Trump Donald Trump\nThere's this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this is done this has\nPut China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you gotta make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the child comes never thought this was going to happen\nThey don't want Trump they don't want to be more of Trump they wouldn't be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democratic Party in America wins\nThat somebody has to have to say Russia's probably ... be met for radio six hungry when you when [noise]\nWhen you put a safe in your home what would you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skill sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure safes in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive beaver network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our age I Am a rhino safe dot com\nThey make the delivery and insulation easy by with peace of mind rhino safe dot com given Iowa did\nStop TV stream out I our Radio Free liberty saves at wholesale price to the public liberty saved from Cedar Rapids now at forty nine fifty jumps in Aberdeen North West open after two PM or by appointment called three one nine nine eight one Ninety One Ninety nine\nIt's your choice you get in Iraq if you're a choice where you get your vehicle repairing\nCatholic religion and there were all insurance companies being repaired straightening experts make it right here in T. [noise]\nBeen put through what do you make of that Hillary\nAnd what message including the president's mocking of Christie ... Ford for her allegations what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one white women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice they don't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd there again Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept\nFor a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens\nThey had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a task\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable\nWay and that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private\nRefuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law\nWhen they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most startling example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is that\nParty has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened to the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nHe is not my you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face that's what Joe Biden ruled the Democrats invented that\nRule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh

[laughter] hey my point is ah today a with Hillary's comments that are facing liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded\nMe of a profound credit came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility for barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or certainly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant\nAnd so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight uh with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violence shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democratic party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy wasn't worth it then\nThink it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word and what not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time there they seek a\nIssue was a labor laws and a win for what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in\nOn militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my boy they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be network\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance tremendous share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bills\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

said about last night's swearing in was a political event\n\nOr upset I guess that's why she lost she doesn't she never did I knew that a long time ago Hillary never got it that's why she lost\n\nHillary also said yes it is that that the sex claims against her husband are not\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation because her husband faced intense investigation\nHillary has a point we have to acknowledge she has a point the allegations against her husband were substantiated they were investigated and Bill Clinton was found to\nBe guilty he was found guilty of all kinds of things Kavanaugh not not enter will not be\nThere's not a single allegation against Kavanaugh that has any evidence or corroborate should but the allegations against Bill Clinton had been proven Hillary's right she doesn't intend to be\nBut she is right the allegations against her husband were substantiated Bill Clinton paid and eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement the Paula Jones\nJennifer Flowers have audio tapes of his come on to her one either Broderick told others about her rape immediately\nThere was a pattern with Bill Clinton and sexual harassment there's no such pattern with Kavanaugh speaking of that did you hear about this Jane Mayer\nPart of the wild Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow writing at the New Yorker from that second story the New Yorker came out with that not even the New York times would print because they couldn't validate any other Jane Mayer showed up\nAt what was it the Atlantic [noise] there was some kind of a\nConvention or festival or some such things New Yorker reporter and Jane Mayer suggested in an interview that she added Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told\nElle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be what the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern and this is amazing\nShe ran on corroborate a story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times sounded so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat is a true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nI'll be you couldn't even substantiate a single goal allegation be from all the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Amman his client\nWas her name is what I mean this is just flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well than use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYeah we needed to show a pattern here is Kristen Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very close to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and wanting to get your thought you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with this novel as it is and that Hillary claiming that they're hurting neatness civility right now I'm\nI guess get worried when the mom and they left as an act and that\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people\nUm it just
