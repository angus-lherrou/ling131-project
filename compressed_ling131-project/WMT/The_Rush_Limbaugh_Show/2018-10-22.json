Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station\nHumanity Brady found sneeze seven thousand migrants still on the news from Central America toward the southern us border\nWe asked about who's organizing it we were told by the organizers who is now saying that it\n\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they wouldn't be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nAnd that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm of what's happening every day and our border\nEvery day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is the Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still mayor ... year about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that led the ... they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has said\nOver and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\n\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden undecided all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see pictures\nOf of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I mean look at random video you might you might see some people's choice but I mean we don't see how this is being handled\nWe don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams that what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street I mean it got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many\nMiles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense\nTo a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those are very real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen\nJust seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand

by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised\nThe stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my goal claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising the stakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind wouldn't want this\nWho in their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who when they're right mind would promote this and wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this\nBecause remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president\nWent on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of house off this country is getting and one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mass the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting ends allowing may as well just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much

the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the

and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob uh seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started
