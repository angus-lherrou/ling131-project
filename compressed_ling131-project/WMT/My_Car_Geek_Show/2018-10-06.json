I Would have made it like ... like I'm self conscious about that\nWill Sheff still the same way because really there's high expectations for us too so we can't post a picture on social media of food unless it's like primo yes and then we're like our own worst critics so I've already torn apart before I even posted it already and like also and so I could say this this and this you know\nI I literally was like oh I Can't post picture goulash because I Gotcha Cynthia all these people want to know or you know I got Cindy was also a shop and like I Can't post this now here's a bowl of cereal a Frank and Barry that's what I have\nA yeah [laughter] yeah but that stuff is amusing you could always go to some other famous chefs site and maybe just the Olympics surely I don't know what I made takeout actually I've been to oh yeah that'd be great yet as to what was your question man from the from the question and answer portion of the program\nI understand from I'm One of my neighbors a Lynette who you did it event for her dad coach land as the other day and apparently what stuck with her the most is a Brussels sprouts appetizer and uh she indicated\nThat it was rather fabulous so these Brussels sprouts I tell ya\nWhen we put them on the menu a couple of years ago I did not expect them to take off the way that they didn't know because it's like the most Brussels sprouts nominee I Love it it's very simple we just take Brussels sprouts we cut them in half we write him and we toss them in what we make a in houses that called the sauce\nAnd it's fifty fifty soy sauce to sugar ... on so equal parts yeah\nUm and then it has tons of uh other\nSeasonings and flavors and it's got a men's garlic chop scallions chili paste sesame oil toasted sesame seeds um\nAnd we glaze brussel sprouts with him top on sesame seeds and that's their age and roasted brussel sprouts appetizer so in this case that party it we've kind of taken a step further and we chop those up and we put them inside of a sesame tone\nAnd pass those around and their little Asian Brussels sprouts homes\nNow what's a sesame cone I'm an idiot I'm ... I'm thinking like a sugar cone but it's just got sesame seeds on\nWell it's like a version of that so less sugar on yeah absolutely it's like a little\nAh wafer cracker shaped into a cone shape and then we just fill it with a glaze brussel sprouts and people go crazy for apparently and it's one of those things I Can't ever take off the menu it'll kind of became a staple and it's it's just so simple what we'd probably sell at least twenty orders a day\nAt least yeah so when I started at the club the only appetizer with shrimp cocktail [laughter] and I was looking for ... for him [laughter]\nShrimp right ... well I'm In an interesting that you went with\nBrussel sprouts it's can I say bastard on the radio while you just did the bastard of vegetables because people are so afraid of it and I'm not sure what I Am garlic I'm afraid of you know it's actually you know I've ...\nYou can do many things I say well it's funny because people are like oh I have yeah I've never tried that and they try one and they're like oh my God I think I like Brussels yeah\nUm and it's because as a kid you'd probably grow up having them and they're like most like\nFalling apart and these are completely different there just perfectly are more refined ride and yeah\nLet me let me ask you um is there something as a chef you won't eat like I don't like this certain sort of food like I don't like seafood or I don't like you know the right thing or you just dropped my pen I myself I don't know why that up a ... that you just will not taught you won't won't have\n... I don't think so I really don't um as a kid I hated mushrooms and eggplant oh my mom used\nTo eat the sardines and it can and like mustard sauce and ... could not even be around the smell of that actually that might be it\nYeah ... and I just brought back memories memories you're going to get sick go over there and really you know yeah I can hear the cancer dean never smoked oysters like all kinds of seafood no can't do it smoke toilet fresh seafood or yeah I I can do to keep it all day but not cancer to you know\nI don't think I've ever had cancer really I've never had I've never been afforded the opportunity [laughter] or ...\nOh I must be insulted you know yeah I don't see them all in one of life's fast growing up in the south I mean my lunch box was a can of the NFL is always there [laughter]\nIn my\nLiving out in the Carolinas ... we'd go we'd go catch a lobster name than going full time when you boil them um is there something your that's your absolute favorite you know besides you talked about the ... it'd be I say I could eat of God it was all day every day uh\nApples I yeah ... ... right so what what's it like cooking in the mid west compared to like back home\nFor you you know it's more similar than I thought it would be and what's really interesting about working at a country clubs I have so many members that come to me and they told me you know we all over the world are all over the country all the time we're always traveling and when we come back to Cedar Rapids when we come back home we want a home cooked meal and we want to come back to our comfort food mhm\nUm we're not looking for anything crazy fancy mean some numbers are but [noise] for the most part\nUh the country club is home to our membership um so my one of my focuses is\nHaving a restaurant be comfort food ... um which is really similar to the south or you know the meat and potatoes and corn and you know hearty meals um that's that's more of what we focus on and then just taking that step further and making it somewhat elegant and see\nThe refined yeah well I mean you could you make goulash elegant 'cause I Love to watch how would you make that element what would you do oh there's lots of [laughter]\nUm\nThat's really funny oh well\nIt starts by changing the process that you can do like a popper deli pasta with a goulash instead of like your elbow noodles ... that's what it is it's part of the fun though were say by the vote 'em I'm Sorry I'm ... I'm dampening your parade I'm Sorry [laughter]\nUm how you\nGarnish it I mean the way but the I don't know decorated with sour cream or\nSo for a pretty good with a red wine or a white one what would you would do ...
