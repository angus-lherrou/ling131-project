John's is suspended for that first half after that targeting call so you have\nA Christian Welsh at a middle like having a player middle linebacker in jama Colbert and variance in a way we could be seeing maybe somebody like a deal in the oil the freshmen from Iowa City west of course Chris ... son uh so it's going to be interesting that line backer and then are\nStill trying to figure out you know who's going to start a cornerback for Iowa or you're going to as I was going to go with the two freshmen from last week a moss and Julia sprint\nOr do you know as Matt Hankins healthy enough or you're going to go with the origin Modi as well and the other side because then he has got some tall wide receivers they got some uh they got one of the leading receiver six foot three they have a one that's six foot four as well so that's\nDefinitely going to be a challenge in Indiana a Ramsey is a dual track kind of quarterback so uh that that's probably going to be the challenge for Iowa um last time they were your twenty Fifteen or they're in that undefeated season even though they won that was a a point game I almost forgot how back and forth that game was so um\nSo you know Indiana's got uh it it seems like a I was going to have\nTo really slow down the pace of that often so that that's definitely going to be the probably the case that game is that that's just you know with Iowa with the injuries that line backer and then just question marks of who they want to start that defensive back\nYeah Iowa or or both of those Indiana receivers rather with over a hundred years receiving all we can go now the defensive line Josh may be the X factor you think in this one pressure on Ramsey probably uh to the extent he hasn't seen yet this year\nYeah I Know you would you would think that that's going to be the big thing and they know and of course had three sacks last week against Minnesota\nAnd do we know people have been begging for more staff from age ... or um yeah I Know what you would think that you know especially if they're going to have a young secondary if they're going to go with your freshman the defensive line is really going to have to step up a um I'm not sure if\nThey're a change and try and put a little bit more but um you know that format rush they're going to need a lot of consistent pressure or today just to help those young guys out tennis um just just to make it a little bit easier because um we saw\nUm you can look at the northern Illinois again we saw you know northern Illinois was able to set the tone a little bit early by you know running right out the line backers and then I made a few changes and then I was able to shore up a little bit but uh uh this could be a different circumstance today at\nA if they don't if they don't do it right\nTo an end Josh Christians in with us on the road in Indiana gentlemen let me leave and Joshua leave you with this thought this is from the daily Hoosier dot com oh boy you go through on the blah blah blah blah blah blah last\nTwo lines on the ... are you in a jazz she is concerned about this is I Am now but\nYou'll find this interesting [laughter] laugh lines on the page [laughter] we're going against our better judgment here and we think somehow the who's yours will find some magic\nIndiana twenty eight Iowa twenty seven oh they had\nTo convince themselves to pick in India\nAnd as I get a I got bad news Indiana defense Josh isn't that good if I Will only scores twenty seven hundred [laughter]\nYeah I think a a\n... there's question marks as I recall him aren't going to be available now and that kind of change how they want to run the ball as well so we'll see but a magic or not I I'm a little surprised they want to use that word\n[laughter] oh well we'll\nLet you go here maybe I'll get a little rise out all\nThe states allowed to use the word magic\nPill [laughter] imagine getting in there today at the Hilton or at a jak stadium finding a parking spot with all the time they've had the magic is getting your vehicle back out that a magic ... evening against West Virginia [laughter] All right\nHey could you could have drawn and worst assignment the audio driving all night and go to memorial stadium at least you know you'll be able to leave when you want to leave exactly\nThat that's true because uh I mean I Know we still got you know three hours to kick off but um if if what I'm looking at you know a boy and he has got a long way to go as far as I'm concerned\nAs far as tailgating [laughter] really passed right [laughter]\nIt would be and you'd be able to get a longer now too so [laughter] gosh I thanks for the time this morning buddy you guys have a safe drive back home All right\nYou bet sounds good\nLooking forward to shame your reports Josh Josh Christians and we can ... from our sports partner ... over in memorial stadium okay served All right now is your prediction time you're going to you're going to go go along the lines of a against your better judgment here are what are your failure against\nMy [laughter] uh let let's see last week I called for a while to attend point gay oh you might like thirty five fourteen or something more than a year or so and it turned out to be much higher scores I did not expect that last week you know I think this one\nUh what's the deal with the uh the way Indiana throws the ball now they've got a lot of questionable injuries coming out of that Ohio State game in fact few that are as ... reading some of the tea leaves here injuries that nobody knows about ah from the Ohio State came yet either that or coach is not shared with\nI Want to go Iowa I like the thirties Iowa thirty to Indiana\nTwenty ... Twenty one [laughter] that was a dark landed yeah and it's called not to go see that far Custer\nThirty and so I Am thirty two Twenty one in favor of the good guys favor the hot guys really something that we some injuries that we don't even know if that's a deadly that'd be one of those receivers ... yeah you I mean obviously you know ... Kelley Martin a retelling Martin then you've got ... filer\nLoop ten men that these are some of the Indiana named one of the way it is oh and by the way there are you or other ... Indiana injuries during the OSU game that we know nothing about beyond Allen indicating that they were not season ending end quote from the daily Hoosier\nYou will see ah I guess we well known dolphins adulthood fans can play yeah I can probably well meaning\nHey maybe it's the David Torn young shows have you been clamoring for a lot of a lot more into war and young too when you do your nails on point I think we could have a great game if he kind of just refined meant to be a fantastic game the vertical asking him look good last week we've asked to news here today we'll talk to you from Hudson\nOutside tap on highway one in Iowa City was sweet looming silky Trevor afterwards game day specials\nInclude have first of all boys were slicing ... head on down there and enjoy the game and then we'll see you\nAfterward Jim ... of the game they show up in their own\n\nOn news radio recovering\nMango motors hurricane soccer jeweler am replace assisted living in rather Holly shop for men\nFrontier future who now implement Stutzman incorporated vilify froze\nLinder tire colonial\nHosted in France has come out for the metal manufacturing carpenters union local swell sixty\n... attachment electronic engineering and leave fire sprinkler systems [noise]\nHe was radio six hundred WINZ [noise] these\nThese news radio six hundred W.

the Iowa Hawkeye is joining us live from\nMinnesota and what a lot of people probably don't know about Raphael is that he is one quarter Native American and there are tribes north of Minneapolis and right now he's starting a brand new job his career is taking him into a federal loan program which provides economic help\nFor American Indians and and you know you and I talked about this briefly Raphael but you know people just get a mindset and they're like oh American indian casinos a you know there's a lot going on there are people here in this country people who are here for years and years and years or trying to keep their culture alive\nAbsolutely and it's it's a you know going against a huge battle\nUm but you know tribes are looking at ways to expand their businesses or a you know American Indians themselves are entrepreneur Z all looking to start their own businesses but uh for history purposes you know having access to that type of capital has has been very difficult to come by so\nI'm super excited about this opportunity going to be able to help uh you know people from my community hopefully\nEstablish themselves as as business people growing businesses for the tribes or that they can continue to to be sovereign nations and hold onto their culture and be able to provide services for their members so very very excited for this opportunity to help\nAnd good luck with that now when you take off the uniform for the final time it's always a kind of a bittersweet moment for players a but after what you guys did in that final season of your senior seeds and eleven and to you go to the Orange Bowl\nYou basically treat the Georgia Tech defensive line like rag dolls\nI mean that wasn't even a contest did you feel like you were like so much better than them\nI think um you know going into any game you you you\nDefinitely expected to be a a competition but I think just with everything that we had gone through that year and you know losing Ohio State um you know I think we all felt that we were the the true a big tent champions that year and we just wanted to go out and prove ourselves and uh there wasn't any team that was going to be out on that feel that day that was going to stop us\nSo looking back on it now you were able to walk away everybody remembers that you know hey you had the skill to play and start in the Big Ten and you know everybody hopes to get to the next level that didn't happen for you all have you been able to just kind of wrap everything up in your head and go\nThat was good now I'm off to the next part of my life\nAbsolutely and and you know the more I get older too it's it's one of those things that uh I didn't have those continuous yours is speeding up my body\nUm financially of course you know who's going to say no to that but what's what's fun now is being able to watch all the guys that I used to play with or other guys that come out and play on Sundays and uh you know it's just we're all still part of that family and uh\nIt's always fun to cheer those guys on\nAnd of course when you walk around Minnesota you're like yeah I Know Floyd I Know him personally I picked him up and don't tell me anything about you know the guys because we'd be four years in a row you got you got major bragging rights going\nOn ... it's the best is the best I mean it's I I remember one time I went to a
