course they hope their auction wrap up their six when all of the campaign that come in and\nRead it for the first time all year number Nineteen joining us now is the man who talks about our game sponsor we can't do the show without our game sponsor\nThat of course is Chris ... senior brand marketing manager with Wal Mart Blue Cross and Blue Shield Chris I feel like we've been doing this for about a decade of my close we've been doing it for nine seasons I'm sure it's not hard to believe that it's aged us a few years yeah no\nIt's great you guys came up with this three point play All right which is a unique partnership with the University of Iowa\nAnd that's not fans in their driveway shooting the three pointer that's like a three point playing basketball and all kinds of things explain how it works and where the money goes\nAbsolutely so the Walmart three point plays all about eating right moving more feeling better pretty simple right keys to better health\nBut we partner with the guys that means that were sponsored in every field goal throughout the football season and then every three pointer throughout the men's and women's basketball season\nSo we just actually make a charitable contribution forever successful field goal and three pointer and that goes into kind of a charitable bank and then we actually asked fans we need hockey fans to participate and there'll be the nominee of the community to receive those funds seasons and\nAnd then what will do with those funds is is really invest in the health infrastructure project I could be a park playground trail cool so so far we supported over nine projects really throughout the state a courtesy of well marking the Hawkeye so it's been an absolute when when partnership\nSo I'm driving down the street and I see some kids actually not staring into a screen and playing at the park and throwing a ball around that's ...\nThat's the whole idea yeah so we really thinks\nSuccess on the field kind of begets success in the community so that's the design of the of the partnership and and like I said it's been a win win it's been great for for both\n... and you mentioned and we've been doing this for nine years now how much cash in the till\nSo that that's really the the point and that's what's incredible to ah to come here and talk about solar over nine seasons we've already raised a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars flop we'd reinvest tobacco with community courtesy of well marking the hawks\nAnd that's including twelve thousand dollars last season alone so you can see an aggregate over or the or the span of this partnership that impact has been pretty tremendous similar works out of talked about\nIt's amazing you mentioned a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars because my daughter just got engaged and I'm thinking that's what the wedding\nIs going to cost a little bit about that yeah you're probably right that the going rate is right let's put that in a park a playground something a little more well you know they ... they're both going to be permanent gym so that is that you're right it's a lifelong commitment to wellness and to love buddy\nThere you go

Lions coach head coach of course uh\nPlayed with the Iowa caucus back in the Nineteen seventies so you into the ... you guys are good friends assure you talk Tony ... says hey man I'm going to retire or I'm going to say that you should be the coach because you're you're my sister that go to any way everything goes smoothly so smoothly in fact\nThat you when the first fourteen games of the season\nAnd then your general manager calls you and says\nHey Jim you don't think you should play anymore starter for a couple of games and what was your first reaction\nIs well you know I wouldn't put all on bill you know it is one of the things that ... something that we had always done I mean you look at the previous season so we always those last couple of games if we had the playoffs solidified home field advantage solidify that we would and indeed restaurant players\nThat was different because we had lost the game of surfing records are there yeah there are several times when they lost a couple here and there\nUm so but nevertheless we want to deviate from our formula and I and they got us where we wanted to go when you finish it off you know that was that was the key\n[noise] let me ask you what happens when you get a call now you want to Detroit and we all know Detroit is kind of a graveyard\nFor NFL football at least has been after the fifties you win more games over your tenure there than anybody is one since like Nineteen Seventy two\nBut still they're not happy and you got to go [noise]\nWhat is your you've been through this so many decades ditch you kind of laugh the yourself did you say whatever I mean there's nothing I can do about it\nYeah you know that's kinda the way it goes in our business that one of the things I mentioned earlier that I'd always work on the one year contract when I first started working on a one year yeah and as a player I thought it would just come and go and I thought it would be no different for me when when I got started so you know those kinds of things happen\nAnd I and I think without question it's they're good people they agreed on a ship and and I also think my Clinton wanted to get his guy in there you know that was I think what he was comfortable with and um [noise] and uh you know and he has a right to do so [noise]\nSo what would you say all the members of the media who\nWho covered you so I'm

against these\nGuys out none whatsoever to be honest with you um the number one and I'll tell you this and and I know it will probably go viral here so [laughter]\nI've never read an article written about a team that I've been coaching ever my entire career I had ever since Nineteen\nEighty seven [noise]\nWritten about me borrow team win lose ... whatever it might be so I could see objective in

I think that's um you know there's there's lots to only four more jobs more young men to have an opportunity to play the great game\nAnd um you know I don't think there's any question about right now what I've done and really only been to very small amount of this fellow consulting for them which has been a lot of fun and I think they're on a a great Jeffery if there's time\nJim is so good to see you do have to ask a the super bowl rings now I I Know you came up short against the New Orleans saints and that was post Katrina and the result is a motion and everything but when you lose the super bowl that's got to take a little time to get over it\nYeah it certainly does you know it's one of those things that uh it takes you a month or two and then you obviously you're back to business again
