hunters\nYeah saw interestingly a we have a A R wildlife guy sent out to Iowa ... hundred survey or in its fourteenth year um typically you get chosen to be in a in in bald with the survey if you've purchased a bow hunting license for for archery deer\nAh three consecutive years in a row you can you can be picked to be\nA in this survey about nine thousand both hunters are selected to be in this survey and I got mine in the mail the other day and and I've done it a couple\nSeveral well some several years here and uh basically it's an observation survey and you calculate when you go out and sit in your most and you keep track of the number of\nHours or minutes or whatever you sit and you're both ... and then you count what type of animals that you see and when you get done I come back home and I sit down and I fill out on a bubble sheet you know how many of these animals that I saw 'em or seen\nAnd so we're looking to attract deer badgers bobcat coyotes gray Fox red Fox house cats um possum\nYou got to go to the ... house cats you'd be surprised how many house cats are\nAre out in in the timber um auditors raccoons and skunks and then turkeys and what better people to utilize for this type of survey than both hunters who spend countless\nHours sometimes sitting in a boat stand wildly observing Mother Nature mhm and uh and I've seen a bobcat I've seen auditors playing in a creek you know and so you calculate all that and then uh\nYou calculate that information up until the about the time that you either harvest an animal and you're done bow hunting or until a certain time on the survey ... towards the end of the season and then you send that into the wildlife\nA bureau in and then they calculate that information and use that for population analysis and other men use it for other management tools for our wildlife in Iowa so it's a great great survey\nSo you have to sign up to get it or is it going out to although\nI Know you don't have to sign up um I think that if you want to be involved and you can contact our wildlife but they select nine thousand license buyers and they mail these out to him I'm it sounds like um [noise] we get about\nThree thousand surveys ... and so it's not a hundred percent a return on it but um\nYeah if I if you get on the wire and yeah she could be very valuable it is very valuable\nSo don't throw it in the ... in the garbage in and fill it out and help us out\nAnd you mentioned earlier driver alert as a boy but they're everywhere in fact I had one hit\nMe the other day did you really are we out into the side of your front wheel yeah no kidding yeah well minimal damage which I'm very thankful for what they are moving\nWell the campaign a notice side of our department is don't fear for deer right so it's that time of year dear are moving farmers are out harvesting their crops um [noise]\nWe're a little off to the mating season yet but I have seen some bucks moving pretty hard um the main rut or mating season is going to be you know that last week in October through about mid November So that's when really the movement really starts but\nEven these farmers kicking the deer around we want people to be aware I'm\nYou know the deer numbers are stable\nWe uh after the Nineteen nineties when we had a higher population in in around two thousand five two thousand six we did a an extensive do harvest which reduce the numbers\nUm we we reduce those numbers to a stable a level now are actually roadkill numbers or wrote roadkill reports are down thirty five percent and so uh but still a there is that possibility out there so remain alert\nA slow down um\nDon't fear for ah for dear you don't want to drive out of your lane and end up in the ditch um uh that's not a good thing so slow down be alert look look up ahead you know\nDon't just look at the front of your your could be asking up ahead and be watching those bitches because that's where they're going to bounce out of and you see one
