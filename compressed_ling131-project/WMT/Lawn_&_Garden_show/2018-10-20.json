I Know the harvest is probably going to\nAffect some of that a lot of those birds will still be out in the cornfields and things like that but as the farmers are getting out in the field in our own Jason I'm a yeah the the birds are going to be readily\nAccessible so just a few things about safety um while we're talking about the pheasant opener is that you are required by law where an article of clothing external clothing that's a fifty percent blaze orange hat\nA coat shirt or something like that sweatshirt whatever it might be long as it's fifty percent believes orange is required to hunt upland game birds in Iowa so the pheasant presents are up one bird so you're going to be required to wear that blaze orange\nUm some other safety tips is that with the harvest I'm being behind a little bit here believe that uh\nUm corn may be standing and so if you're going to be hunting standing corn or remember to watch for that believes orange and uh one of the number one cause of a pheasant hunting or accidents is swinging on game because they fly right [laughter] so once you pull up on them and they start flying and you're swinging on that game\nYou tend to focus on that target and not what's in front of it are beyond that so\nSure that when you're swinging on game that you'll be me and careful of other hunters that are in the area where he plays orange and and a and B where your dogs do a shooting pheasants on the ground is not illegal but it is a hazard which you had a bird dog this right behind them some um be be careful those a furry friends out\nThere to absolutely um you were mentioning that they're to me at least that there was some upgrades Mississippi River wise\nYeah the uh popular village creek boat ramp up by Lansing on the Mississippi River a is reopened uh and had some improvements\nAh some of those improvements were breeding uh and re paving parking lot um boat ramp extensions in in a restroom that was a put up there so up there on the Mississippi River um that are popular village creek boat ramp has reopened now so cool\nAnd then it's the time of year where we start to turn and things get really gorgeous or in a lot of Iowa State park\nYeah so a lot of our state parks are still being visited during the fall time for this this fall colors and and uh we just want to let you know that I'm most of the facilities in our state parks are going to be a winner raised here really quickly\nAnd so that means that a lot of the shower facilities a lot of the water or a ... and things like that are going to be shut off for the winter\nAnd so but you can go to our in our website I guess in the uh check the website for parks that are still offering water or for that fall camping and just remember too that are camp grounds are you open\nAll year round or they're just limited amenities uh as far as water and shower facilities and stuff like that but feel free to can't be around if you want 'em and visit some are beautiful state parks this fall\nAnd pat thanks as always yeah you bet as your audience in Iowa DNR in with us here this morning on outdoor I Want to thank you for being with us and imagined next Saturday we may have\nA few of you listening or from the open air pheasant harvest and says in season so we may talk more about that probably will then All right we'll talk about an hour now from the corner Melrose and bell rose before I went in Maryland on homecoming here on these radio six hundred W empty\nYour morning Saturday morning news radio six hundred WMD team we're talking with Tina Peterson who's with magnify from MCS America to morning Sheena welcome to the program and\nGood morning Mary Louise thank you for having me sure outlets tell tell us a little bit about the egg management tool that a MCS America just introduced the sheer\nYes correct or the name is magnify and we launched it in January it is a new software developed specifically far crap and livestock producers\nAre not only performs the standard accounting fact functions but it also translates data from the operation into higher level of reports and analysis which turns gives the producers are better grass on their break events their cash flow and their overall business performance\nOkay now do you have a ... for example Powell producer might use magnify\nYeah we have some of our producers who um a track inventories weather and the operating expenses\nAll the way down to their per acre level um so it reveals what field are most profitable and also helping them understand their cost of production which in turn is allowing the producers to make better decisions when considering rental agreements or land purchases or anything else for the operation\nOkay is magnify built for a certain type of producer do users be time for like a certain size operation or meet any other criteria\nNo magnify is for all crap and livestock producers who value having dad at their fingertips\nTo make those better management decisions whether they currently track those records on homemade spreadsheets I use another record keeping system any producer can benefit from magnifies agriculture specific platform that features combination terms it also allows them to have their farm advisors collaborate and a centralized environment\nA lot of times are getting up and getting going in the biggest challenge how can producers get started using men to find\nYeah producers ready to take their fire management to that next level can start by contacting their local farm credits services of America office we have a dedicated team of magnify specialist well you're not only assess what the um boarding process are they account set up but we also provide on cutting service and training\nNow technology gets out of date so quickly I mean it it's been a a moment's notice and then all of a sudden it's a when you were on the cutting edge you now a bind\nWell but it's all the FCC is America worked to really keep magnify up there on the cutting yup\nAbsolutely Randy so we're always working on software updates and enhancements the butter meet the needs of the magnify users to true to our ... cooperative model we actually value um customer feedback and base or updates on real life user experiences\nNo to hear anything you'd like to add about ...\nYeah I just want to reiterate that in many operations one person usually is responsible for bookkeeping while another is responsible for making operating decisions\nWhat magnify will do as you'll benefit both of them and have that multi access to support the entire farm operation plus look really cool thing is that can be accessed anytime anywhere whether it's your desktop your tablet or even a smartphone\nWe've had customer say that it's drastically improve the overall communication of their operation and just lastly to reiterate that farm credits or America works to be agriculture's most valued financial partner and magnify is just one way we hope to continue to do that\nOkay that sounds like it's a very usable I'm very accessible to so thank you for talking with us about magnify\nJust thank you for the opportunity Randy\nGina Peterson with magnified through MCS America or just this morning on news radio six hundred W. M. T.\nCatch gotcha him I don't know of a Gen is there any rushed out you know she's still working on getting back in here\nAre three six five zero six hundred locally eight hundred and three three to five four zero in anywhere else star six hundred in the usa the hero line\nAnd a Gen talking about amending the ground the dirty around your home sometimes it can be difficult it\nIs I guess another thing that I was thinking of too is that not only can be difficult\nDepending on where it is and depending on what time of year it is it can make some maybe some difficulties if you're doing it around in near your foundation and all of a sudden you just get a ah golly washer yeah that is not a really good time they had that happen\nNo no and you know I've been talking lots of people coming in and a customer's wanting to do things and everybody's complain you know it's just yeah just to wet to do anything\nYeah well that is a very unfortunate where do you you end up in there so many new developments as well that end up with um the uh the clay is rather than just the regular dirt\nYeah much clarity I and you know new construction areas you know that's a really huge problems that are trying to get to your trees planted in and they won the some of your the ball to plan to just\nLet yourself can be amended in ... you know keep doing it year after year and you'll get some good soil\nAll right we've got a question from the text lighted Ninety three thirty four Ninety eight and uh they want to know if ah that we can discuss drew keeping geraniums over the winter well is it possible to do that\nCan and I have done it I don't normally suggests it but\nI'm used to be that people would uh you know put them in a brown paper bag hang him upside down put them in their basement but modern homes these days are too warm for that towel yeah it does me more root cellar kind of yeah that's right that's right\nSo now if you try to do that or you want to keep them more on the active or level right them in a sunny window but\nYou know the [noise] the problem with doing that\nIs that they get so weakened during the winter and you plant 'em outside and it takes so long for them to to get a straight back to bloom and deliberate but you know you're better off just buy a new ones in this\nCountry the good morning walking with the Iowa alone and garden show what is your first name where are you calling from\nI'm Joanne I'm invent and I want to know what do I need to do this fall for my knockout roses\nOkay we'll knock out roses I Would suggest covering them little slightly now you know you read articles are advertisements and they said oh you'll have to do anything to them but it is a good idea no pruning and the fall mhm just leave them all a tall\nUm as far as when to cover them they need to drop their release before you cover him and then you know good pile soil up around the crowd and plant and rake some leaves or something and on top of that\nGotcha there we go Joan Vinton thank you for your phone call we certainly do appreciate it I'm three six five zero six hundred eight hundred three three to five four zero one anywhere else darned six hundred on the usa here line that's the phone number to get in touch with\nA Bob in June from corps what's going on over ... over his right about now you've got the fall that his bullying swing and I would imagine all your Halloween Thanksgiving stuff is just going crazy\nYeah we still have some lungs moms left a sell so if you are still doing some decorating sum up pumpkins and\nA gorgeous that type of thing [noise] um [noise] moms are beautiful still ah we have some nice little yellow as some paint in some lavender one view orange ones left some family that does come out and get them to buy one get one\nOoh wow Enrico Jen Jen what about [noise] excuse me Gen what about some of the things that are ah some of the other things are going on over recovers\nCherish that we don't have any other things and hell no fans are on the seventeenth or Eighteenth as our holiday open house and so I'm like that on your calendar because that is that day that we really are Culver calendars okay\nUm so what that means a chip on for the next year yeah\nWell the available in\nPictures as well yeah yeah\nI mean it's one of the most gorgeous calendars you're ever going to fight yeah so you guys produced set in house don't you mean the Dick you're all that stuff right I mean\nThe fleet do sell 'em all of the pictures are the ones that I've taken or I'm Danielle and then\nUm [noise] the rest of it as the same format as last year so I feel like that one come out and get it but at first come first served um free but part chess\nI Know a lot of people are just plain last year because they ran out a little bit earlier than normal shop and make sure you marked that weekend on your calendar okay and then come out\nMakes our holiday up and how\nIt makes sense seven sixteen here on the uh I Will on and garden shows go into the text line again how do I still store my elephant ear bulbs over the winter I'm In the ... these ... and then there's ... like firewood on the bar and my my personal outside I Would imagine it's gonna be pretty much the same thing you well yeah\nYeah and depending on if you haven't in a pot or in the ground if it's in the ground just stick it up leaves some soil around the bald um beans the ground is so moist\nOutlet that dry a little bit and then pack it in a cardboard box of some newspaper around it that's what I can is to the test they're wet let them try a little bit from ... and with\nOkay but some of the other stuff that's a perennials that is that are more hardy and they had their more stock\nYeah things like what comes to mind first or like a pretty hot out selling flowers are home two hours of leave you know I don't have the little boom heads up there right ... ... feet off the seeds\nShould should you like if you have ... hours that are that are out there did you try to mulch rather base or do you want to do anything like that ... to protect the route loose so you\nDon't want to pack anything around them because you don't want it to hold a lot more moisture and then again a kind of compact\nRight and rot yet this though which would be okay that makes sense makes very big sense [laughter] hey I'm when do you start getting your first Christmas trees engine you ride on top of your head you know ... roughly as\nWell have Christmas trees and a week of Thanksgiving okay I'm hopefully it will be sooner but it kinda depends on the weather last year we had to tell a tree the week 'cause that was actually pretty warm and November So hopefully the week\nOf our open house holiday open house right on the seventeenth Eighteenth will have some um that are greens like just regular ... grains will start coming in the first full week of November\nFor some reason I don't think it's going to be warm yeah last\nYear and it was like\nSixty and sunny and ... where I feel like a call\nFuzzy caterpillars and chubby squirrels are the two things\nThat we asked and ... of acorn yeah we well there's ... and all the fruit trees and stuff had a ... thinks but I did hear something the other day I don't remember where it was but they said a warmer than average\nTemperature low precipitate yeah the national weather service put that thing uh yesterday yeah I was who knows um who knows what ...\nYeah just a farmer's almanac and that they are supposed\nTo be cold yeah is that what it is said huh yeah I I don't know I\nSaw that somewhere but maybe it wasn't for Iowa\nYeah so there was this uh this is really interesting because you were talking about acorns there was a a post that was out there ah on the Internet from a it was it was out of Minneapolis W\nThat do you saw that one of the acorns yeah\nIt says hey ... cars up in Minneapolis they they've got a section called ... he'd already stirs a lately I've noticed sidewalks been literally acorns is a competitive barefoot Roeder says makes my training sessions very difficult\nSo keep your sidewalks clear of any acorns are other things that might injure those who are active members of the barefoot running community turns out it was a joke but I was thinking about this like\nI remember he's red notice so many acorns out there in so many other like the big black walnuts is well I\nThat's one of those things that just is it does it come to a point where people need to take a look at removing stuff like that\nYeah some of those things you know it doesn't happen every\nYear right so right right but if he was like if you get those big means massive big black walnut says\nOut on your lawn yeah no I don't just let them do their thing yeah okay [noise]\nJust like
