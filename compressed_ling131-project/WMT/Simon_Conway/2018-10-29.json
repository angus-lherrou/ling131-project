and his clients may through our community are committee asked to do a lot of follow up investigating it took a lot of time it's\nA a one or two hours in one or a structure of a cold is a fellow NATO

discourage other people in left field jerk\nOr do file a petition with us under all is that\nUh that aren't true because we got foreign foreign things is found her time off right\nWell you know I mean it led to even more contention and otherwise might have existed alone it's hard to imagine now um you know I Know NBC didn't testifies your committee but they did we hold information that was really relevant to you hearing a is\nGoing to be looking at them\nI doubt if we can I sleep it off to a lawyer to tell me whether or not we could but I still that are\nThat they were operating under a First Amendment right and I'm not sure that as long as they were uh being contacted by a they could have been helpful to us\nBut the fact that they weren't helpful or we can condemn or but I don't think where you can charge more they say\nAll right well I kind of light now so I think the first amendment should should Trump pretty much everything uh so uh I'm On a quiet line that also but I have to say that I think that'd be a man when they had\nInformation or discredit seeing an interview that they add and they didn't tell the world about it to me that is a really quite disgraceful or over the last few hours or sending that we've discovered that the president is sending approximately fifty two hundred\nActive service troops to southern border or to uh meet the so called caravan or what do you make of that\nOr what is the number that are being found there five thousand two hundred\nA I think it'd be going through a a\nPowerful for all the way he suggested that\nNone of these foreign companies do ah our country by breaking our laws he would have to be very forceful or be just like Obama\nDrawn a line of sand on the line was cost and there weren't any consequences if a president is going to make a decision I Try to stick by and you got to be able to enforce but\nIt's more of a number than I thought was there a is that fifty two hundred and two thousand people that have been down there\nYes so so we've got we've got the two thousand National Guard the initial group of eight hundred active duty soldiers are have been heading to Texas oh from Fort Campbell\nAnd full notes but now the defense department said this uh by the New York times by the way that they will deploy at least five thousand two hundred active\nDuty troops to the southern border by the end of this week uh this is an official\nAnnouncement today and ah so are we going to assume that that so that's the reality and uh that's very interesting number because the caravan has officially shrunk to about thirty five hundred now and is expected to shrinks new for us so we weigh outnumber them now that's going to be a good thing\nYou know um we've got a a ... mile border we're bottom Iowa\nOr or uh yeah I guess in Guatemala only two hundred mile order so you can see why it's much more\nDifficult for us to defend our border that's why we need the wall and I think this whole thing's going to bring emphasis so the fish that has to be made by December for ... for the money is that the president wants for the wall\nMan you know we'll we'll we'll see what happens with that ah how much of that\nWill be a determined by uh the result on a member of the six or how important is it a rough so Republicans are too I mean I Know you're going to give me the political ... been there a long time but I also know you get to be an honorable man so you're going to give me the real answer as well uh\nI I don't believe the Senate is even in play anymore so how important is it for Republicans to maintain control of the house if you all to deliver things like money for the book will\n[noise] can I can I answer your question beyond just the immigration\nI can answer the question is when you liked Senate\nYeah sure uh this is\nThe way I Want to make up their answers and speeches purple arm and for young or two people I'm trying to help uh still mean Jane goes and needed help and I don't think he does so I'm trying to help those show and I started off my conversation\nWith a simple answer to your question if you are longer and so I'll give you there are ... ... but uh if if the store reelected we probably won't have all the speakers out and then I go on to say that if you like the way this president\nUh is uh hurting the economy around Europe\nTo pay more for their own the fans are finding your crane against twice you're\nTrying to uh ... have a new career as they should have North Korea or and if you uh uh uh like the on employment rate will like it has hasn't been so I feel like the nine and a hundred other things you ought to be able to stay and boating too conservative\nSupreme Court Dr ... if you want that to continue or it's going to come to a halt if only if the speaker of the house and so that's the reason that you should elect a Republican or through the Congress and keep the Republican control\nAnd they could I mean ... if I really do think that if uh the Democrats take the house are they going to spend a fast amounts of time or trying to investigate anything that has the word Trump next to it\nOh yeah and I would say it this way\nBut basically the last year the first term of this and that will come to an all or if if the Democrats take control out\nNow costs history is against ah the ah the Republicans maintaining the house\nUh it's very unusual in the ... midterms a full the party in power to maintain that power is usually a switch and uh uh ... the the fact is we have\nAn incredible economy right now even the people that are trying to attack the president are not saying anything about the economy unless the bronco bomber and trying to take credit for it but the human side not many people are saying much about the economy but

right state of Iowa is Simon come my show is a plot to come out of five thirty eight on a Monday and uh we have a man in our studio who wishes to be out next the secretary of agriculture at Tim Gunn you all very uh very welcome Elissa doing well great to be with you\nUh so I asked the same question pretty much of everybody who's ever running which is why\nWell I've got a love for agriculture in low for rural Iowa farm with my dad and a cousin a century farm just outside mango grew up ah around it and were spent eight years working for Secretary Vilsack USDA so I think I've got the right combination of skills and knowledge\nAh and if the economy is is soft going into the next year due to low prices because of the trade disputes and biofuels policy\nI think we need someone who's going to be put partisan politics aside no matter who's in control in Washington DC and stand up for Iowa farmers in Iowa's economy\nOkay so why does it matter if we have a a a a Republican or Democrat or libertarian I don't think there's one running actually back in this particular a regular there is there is a retiree restore if no and then in such you may have been on stage with him a couple of taking a\nBut why does it matter if it will cause I agree with you I it's hard to see what where the partisanship comes in when it comes to Iraq\nWell I think I don't know if there's a a tremendous amount of partisanship a in agriculture but I think I I don't think I Will farmers are being served right now a buyer elected officials who are not communicating strongly enough to folks in Washington DC that what's going on with a preferring the\nOil refiners over biofuels producers and farmers are is hurting Iowa's economy what's going on with the trade disputes even with the aid package that USDA has announced a it's not going to make our farmers whole\nAh there's a whole lot of kind of a whole lot of concern I think ah when you talk to folks in rural Iowa all the way up through the folks in manufacturing okay that agriculture needs an advocate that will put partisan politics aside\nWas talking about China for a minute then showing what should we do these are people who quite literally dug up seed from Iowa ground\nTo ah to steal from us and then they would have stayed in the city they were stealing the technology so what should we do we just do what are leaders of both parties is to get totally ... done up until now and said that's really terrible you must stop it well he was pretty much was gone I I think", "show_name": "Simon Conway", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids",
