M. t.s Cedar Rapids and I heart radio station [noise]\nString suspicious devices and stocks\nTumbling and the ... uh recap on Wall street in a moment first the latest on the package it sent a multiple locations including a CNN office in Manhattan but mainly appearing to target top Democrats Fox has gone off Scott was more a lot\nAbout it is a serious issue and I\nThose numbers are the highest I've heard you every time I talked to another reporter or needs caster the number grows and I this is really concerning that people are being tied to join this group like this and\nWalk I mean they have another thousand miles to go to reach the U.S border off but I don't think their prospects of of getting in a very good\nUh it it is a problem because if the United states simply allows people to enter show up in this way than there are going to be more and bigger caravans all the time and I'm actually surprised it took\nSo long for this one to form after what happened in the spring when the group smaller caravan was allowed to enter and make asylum claims but it's clear that this is not the result of the humanitarian crisis you're not refugees this is a political\nStatement or dont really organized to make the case or open borders and challenge us sovereignty and people are joining it because of the opportunity not necessarily because they're lean on last or persecution\nAnd so we need to deal with this early there are a lot of things that\nThe U.S government can do first and foremost would be at this point to work with governments\nMexico to try to break it up and and we've done this in years past\nSuccessfully on Mexico is not interested in\nJust in encouraging this if people are not going to be allowed into the United states you know I've spoken with Mexican migration officials before and they don't care about these things if they think people are going to be led into the United states for this is different now\nAnd uh so we need to try to find a way to work with them but\nIt you know there are going to be people who break off from it at ... at fourteen thousand people a lot of them are going to go out on their own and pay smugglers to come in\nAnd we're gonna have to turn them right around that's the only thing that's going to dissuade people\nYou know I Want to run on an just pull up number out of yeah uh I run a ... I read a lot of stuff this morning\nOr those were the highest numbers I read and I don't want a tribute to a particular ah organization because you know I read Fox and then I read CNN I when I get to I Want to get the equal a bias from both sides my all time no I\nDon't mean nothing new I ... just that it's growing it really is grown\nI understand you know those are the two highest numbers I read this morning in fact I was doing a Poland or the second one was a thousand and then I read something somewhere else where it already grown to an off thousands I'm just a recording what I'm literally reading a that's out there on the Internet from from what should be reliable ... let me put it that way\nOr the way they are I'm sure at all but I Do we live in now so yesterday we had a long discussion of the day before yesterday I'm Sorry on my show me that quite a long discussion about what the president could actually physically do\nIf ten thousand people showed up on the southern border ... us on on on I'm like I don't think there's anything that you can do because we we don't want to shoot anybody out of the girls the president's going to give ... I Hope not a ... I Hope not one that has one too many ah\nSo what kind of he actually physically do if they get the it's interesting what you say about Mexico because it goes if Mexico really believes we're going to turn around and suddenly becomes Mexico's problem\nRight exactly and that's you know and I I think that they do have an interest in helping with that but with this large number\nSome of them are going to get to the U.S border and the the really what should happen is we need to announce loud and clear well before they get to the border that\nPeople who cross illegally are going to be apprehended and detained and we moved quickly under an expedited form of due process\nAnd and ... and if you want to ask for asylum\nThen make the case they should apply at our embassy in Mexico city and if people show up on math at the legal ports of entry then we may need to close those ports of entry and of course that would be disruptive to legitimate travel and trade\nBut we cannot have a huge\nGroup of people like that showing up and asking for asylum because it it is clear from these reports that this is not\nAs I said at a um a humanitarian crisis these are people coming here because they think that they will be allowed to stay they've been led to believe that they have that realistic\nBelief because everyone else before them has been allowed in and but but you know we can't sustain that we've got to stop this we can't have our policies encouraging people to take this journey like this\nSo hard it's too dangerous and it's not they're not going to succeed and it's a huge burden on American community that they are led in so enough is enough it's got ... we may have just simply close the border and get support for patrolling the open parts of the border in South Texas to make sure that everyone is apprehensive so\nI'm not sure how much power does the president have or does he need to recoup Congress to DC\n[noise] no I mean there there are things that I Wish Congress would do to fix some problems in the law but we can't wait for that um the the president has the authority under immigration law section to twelve F to deny entry to any\nPerson or group of persons that the president thinks is I'm a a problem for the country that should not be let in\nFor security reasons and this is a section of the law that he relied on for the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court so he clearly has the authority to deny them enter you simply say anyone associated with with this caravan is not going to be\nAllowed to come into the country and yet\nThere are other emergency authorities that the president has such as you get the tide local law enforcement agencies um that have been used before for example when people came from Haiti in large groups by boat\nOn there and ah our border agents the could quickly set up facilities we have a mass migration plan that's been devised ... it was under the Obama administration that says that the H ... should\nStand up ten facilities to shelter people while they're being processed but that way they can be kept in custody in the vicinity of the border if necessary if a lot of people try to come in legally that's what should happen\nAnd got the you know the catch and release policies\nAre causing too many problems that need you know need to be ended and this is a good solution for the short term in the medium term Congress is going to have to act and in the long term you know of course we would be happy to work with Central American country than Mexico\nDo you know improve their economic prospects but that's a very long term solution and that's not going to help with this particular crisis we we simply can't have people can encourage people to do this\nSo the president has said who is in ... he began to do it or I don't know that we go to the evidence of that yet or that he's going to stop cutting off aid to these countries of origin or for a for allowing this to happen\nA that's a century what he said I'm not a solution I I don't know there is\nI mean I I can understand why people are talking about that and it's something that we can look at but the reality is that\nThis aid is peanuts in comparison to the amount of money that has sent home by people who are working illegally in the United states and they're more interested in that as much of\nA much larger amounts and so you know cutting off aid is really I don't think going to be particularly effective maybe we can tailor it a little bit better off but I I don't see that as a long term solution either and sometimes that\nHarms the very people that were trying to help and keep in touch\nWith talking to a Jessica Vaughan a she's a friend who the smartest person that uh uh I Know when it comes to this subject so we're always pleased when we go on the\nUh Jessica you're just taking on another role because we understand that some of the angel families are people who've been on this show in actual fact a rubber planning to go to our southern border or to come from these caravans\nThat's right wow you have good sources\nAnd all my ...\nYear old ... is um a\nTo do with a a a really ... we're going to mess up
