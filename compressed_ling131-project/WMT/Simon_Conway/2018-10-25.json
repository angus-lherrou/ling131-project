the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it\nYou have a house like let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that I'm just picking a number of every one of those things are gonna have to have a wire\nRun into what you want to do that you're not going to do that you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire steam so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that\n[noise] and then when something goes wrong with wind up those wires that might trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got attracted to [noise]\nYou don't

federal investigators try and narrow the surge in the ... can suspicious package it sent a high profile Democrats Fox has gone off scot more live\n... ... people who seem to know about explosive devices do not think this is a serious attempt to blow anybody up but he's still as far as I'm ... ... is still terrorism what do you stand on this\nWell look at the optics of it you know and I am a bird a proponent of why we\nHave to look at the Y. optics behind us but we figure out why which I think a lot of his already know that and then you can get to the who who did we did and I'm not worried about how does it it kind of\nEasy out there in the security world to see how this was put together but why and that's where the outrage that the um you know let's throw everything aside for a minute this is very different than in Austin where we had the explosions where we lost like ... what I'm looking at your this\nAgain is all the optics of really tried to subvert our voting process and the next less than a two week into the elections\nSo ... you you as I pointed out of a protected or presidents and are indeed a former first lady Barbara Bush if if one of these ah was addressed to ah want to protect to use ... what would you what would you um next ... be\nWell I mean I've done it you know most of us\nA lot of the secret service or have done it you know where we had X ray packages\nAnd so there's a whole set protocols not everything but basically we see something suspicious um you know you get more than one I look at it and then right away you would call the\n... thing it's called the local police and usually they have the bomb squad come in if you're in a major city and then the FBI or to come in\nBecause at that point you know you're looking at the federal nexus and eventually the secret service would turn it over to the FBI and the ATF who are the best in the world at the\n[noise] um so we're hearing that there's a a Florida connection the the envelopes ...\nReally bad and we put together a there's a whole bunch of a postage stamp some but they don't appear to have gone through a poster stuff is some reason I'm ... that seems to be deliberate misspellings who's not designed to throw you off to make you feel like dealing with an idiot\nWhen maybe you're not dealing with an idiot Florida was spelled incorrectly for example uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... incorrectly a Brennan was spelled incorrectly and Brennan doesn't work CNN do you think this is all deliberate I mean it looks like they were designed to be found not designed to do any home\nCorrect I think again it all the optics behind it and\nYou know when you look at the misspellings but this is typical of very in the class of going online it's almost like a bad movie you know first of all I Want to throw out there that thank God nobody was hurt but this time I look at a movie\nOkay where everybody has seen some type of packages like this before and whoever is doing this is copying it from a bad movie it's really you know put together ... and this is what we're getting again the optics less than two weeks out from an election [noise] so\nIt it strikes me I'm not I mean it's almost like they're telling us what we we always forensic ... hinting at least that's my feeling is hinting that they've got a ton of DNA and they're going to get this person pretty quickly um [laughter] do you think that's likely\nWell I I I think that will get somebody I don't know how quickly and when they're saying a ton of DNA you\nGot to remember whomever touch this besides the bad person or person may have left DNA so you have to sort through all that there may be some fingerprints on it you know it has been handled by the post office you know there's many different hands on that and so they have to sort through all of that but you know they have ideas\nI think you know when you're trying to practice down the same\nWay is that you know when we just saw deniro Robert Deniro receiving this package was early in the morning down and so a whole New York you can't walk around New York city today without a camera was it who delivered when was it delivered\nOh there's a lot of clues that left behind but for the DNA part I I'm not too sure about that yet because there's so many people that may have handled these packages\n[noise] I'm saying a ton of forensics and not not just in a a ton of forensics\nYeah absolutely so just\nThe way that you know ... every person leaves the signatures of how these makeshift bombs and that's what I'm all in the right now because of big clues time and there's been no nation if there was if this were some\nBombs that were actually act or in a way to blow up they would have ... we have not heard that so that's a big clue but just the way that they're still putting together the construction if there's a park on it a blessing path which we have not heard about\nAll they'll get it back together and they find it back from what I understand uh to to where you can grab off the Internet where unfortunately you get most of the\nMore you know as we both know you can get information on how to build your own new on the Internet based it's a very very uh very sad indeed I'm All right so\nIt unfold on me I'm I'm looking at ... some line I'm told but you never attached wires to both ends of a pipe bomb um clearly a they were why is to both and that's another thing the picture of the envelope the picture of the device that\nCame out and really quickly and law enforcement can't be happy about that kind of you\nKnow and I wouldn't be either you know I when I saw that right away I was taken back\nThat you know obviously I think was and and that put that out that quick\nAnd it's a jump to conclusions when you have an active ongoing threat against people is the wrong thing to do and you know they they should really be\nHeld accountable for that because at this point you know you don't want that information out there and because you want to start tying point a to point B and when you're receiving all these packages to see if it's coming from the same individual\nRight because evil so well what you've done is you've ah\nBasically put out the blueprint for uh any copycats which is what it looks like this is what the envelope looked like a few go I mean\nSpeech ... crowds sharing threats against people audited by at ten ten bombings looks a lot more like more violence than women loudly appealing to elected officials to keep accused sexual predators out of power\nBut if a mom as a group of civil engage women on survivors while very fine people um Nazis and white nationalist know exactly which I'd rather be cool\nI'm wearing me angry mob label like a badge of honor and huge green mold sweatshirt to die\nAnd on and on and on not making it up and go to Doug about that we may go that dog\nYes what do you make it out what I just read out\nI think it's the pot calling the kettle black\nInteresting isn't it very interesting\n... or ... or so generally speaking what do you ah what do you think of what's going on right now\nI actually think it is a Democrat trying to drum up sympathy for them political terms ...\nOkay I mean I don't think it's a serious attempt to anybody on a dunks uh but I still ... and I'm happy to call it terrorism because I Do believe that there are ... what terrorized by about ... very definition of terrorism\nOr so a fascinating stuff we'll keep an eye on it but they're already fundraising off of it a which is a which is\nGreat and and the people who may not be the liberal persuasion\nAre again go nuts seeds in the whole fundraising effort I thank you very much Doug ... shut it have yourself a great rest of the day of five on five to

everything is Trump targets trial it's it's about\n... about the situation and I mean\nI'm I'm Out of the armed brother I go to let you go but I Do I Do thank you I get the point I really do a this is
