{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "That has had some history of rotation and we were following this arm\nRingo city can and I understand we have some new video in out of marine go probably on this particular storm cell yeah\nMost likely\nOh go ahead Kori what do you have\nOr weather service just continue the warning for Benson county areas of Iowa county have been cleared but in ... county there and I was saying that three forty nine confirmed tornado was located older Blair's town okay\nOr our so air people inventing county within this warning need to seek shelter now\nOkay so it's on the southern side of\nParticular storm cell that we have been following hair\nUm get down a little bit tighter on that particular storm sell here and that's where the rotation is that the ... video that you just saw\nA was something that uh the the um Ringo city cameras also showing multiple times here the velocity data would suggest that close to the Blair's town area are getting you mentioned three forty nine Corey saw two minutes ago um it's probably from\nThis right here this little rotation right in here um that it's moving towards the north northeast\nSo places like new hall this may may miss you just off towards your west um but it's close enough that I'd say you need to be in your safe area a farther up the line here I'm get just to the north the van horn up through the Vincent area and all this continues to move generally off towards the north northeast but it's really the southern side\nOf the storm cells and individual little thing here that's moving its way up towards the north and that's the part that is that a history of producing some funnels too because we saw some funnel clouds out of\nI'm over them Ringo area a little bit earlier or we'll go out and put a storm track on this as it's working its way in or they'll change it over to\nUm [noise] the radar reflectivity the typical reds and oranges and greens that you're used to seeing I'm just north of the Blair's town area right now widened the view out just a little bit here\nAs it moves its way up towards the north northeast and these have been going at a generally thirty thirty five miles an hour that's going to put it up towards the Vincent area here really before too long probably over the next Fifteen minutes or so the English Ellsberg and may miss shells were just towards the west\nUm but the north northeast movement has been very consistent here um with this particular pocket of thunder storm activity there's the loop will widen it out for here and show you the bigger picture here but we have happening because we have not just that tornado there are that tornado warn cell there but we have another one\nThat's just beginning to accept that particular warning in northeastern sections of Delaware county\nWe saw that happened earlier with Butte county so they'll probably be changing that warning over either do a severe thunderstorm warning or perhaps dropping it entirely further on down towards the south there is one more tornado warn cell to the west of ... and that is right in here and that is not had any sort of confirmation on that either\nBut it just goes to show that any one of these cells could feasibly start rotating\nAnd just about any time here because we still are this is the situation to where we don't necessarily need daylight\nFor this to happen uh we are in a scenario where we got a couple of storm cells down here to the south even though these are not tornado warned at the moment\nI'm just to the south of north English we're seeing a little bit of rotation there too so any one of these little things could start to ah to spin a tornado up right now the reason though that we are on the air is for what's happening in Vinton County and also what's happening it towards the Delaware county so\nWe will start in Vinton County and then um get a visual for you on this year and just a little bit as to what's going on in our city can network across the eastern Iowa it's right near the players town area moving towards the north between van horn and new hall here as well or the ring of city cameras able to see the southern side\nOf this particular storm this pretty much the entire time either the southern or eastern side of it\nIs it works its way off towards the north northeast over in ... to we can get a visual there from the marine go area where we're not seeing ... but looking back towards that particular storm or we can see that there is there the storm in the distance as it's moving to the north\nAnd away from the ... area and ah but this is a this is for the uh the tornado confirmation that is near the Blair's town area this tornado warning again\nThis goes uh it's moving north to twenty five miles an hour this goes until four Fifteen and with that confirmed tornado that was just to the north of the players town area\nOh let's go back to ... talk a little bit of rainfall totals because that is also very important to us as we had to the next several days some isolated totals as you can see because of the scattered nature of these storms will kind of let you know how much has fallen and stuff\nMary's notice in areas well back toward power she county we have over two and a half inches of radar estimate as strong as moving out of Iowa and in Tibet and county the one that produce the tornado one inch of rain has been reported\nThat storm crossing areas of Clinton County over an inch of rain has been reported this just in the last hour again this is the last hour one point two inches of rain across areas if you can and county farther back\nJust off to across areas acute Cook County around an inch as well so certainly some very very heavy rainfall totals brief though they may be they're dropping some very very heavy rains to keep that in mind\nAs you're out in the boat across the eastern Iowa with any of the storms that are moving through want to stress again that we do have that one report now of a confirmed tornado and remind her that he tornado watch had been posted earlier this afternoon\nAnd does include a large portion of the TV nine viewing area or does officially include Manchester Cedar Rapids Iowa City Washington Waterloo and team of what we did notice earlier\nThat tornado warning across series at a Butte county as well as those storms have moved off toward the east and Mimi northeast actually about thirty to thirty five miles per hour right now scattered activity still continues across these trial with numerous warnings that guy was pointing out\nWill tend to take a look at a wide do right now for those that may just be joining us um scattered areas of thunderstorms and breaking out across the eastern Iowa each individual and characteristic that means they kind of have their own\nWay of going about doing business and as a result they have that potential to spin more like a line where you get that strong gusty winds that moves through\nEach of these storms has the potential to spin and as a result we've seen numerous tornado warnings and no one official reporter that tornado near the Blair's town area all these storms heading off towards the north east as you look farther back off to the west you do notice once again\nI'm heavier areas of rain or back Spencer Fort Dodge Carol Atlantic area how those heavier is a brain will be with us as well so once this system moves\nThrough the area with the scattered thunderstorms are more that will develop and eventually more heavy rain moves and as well and that's kind of that secondary story at the moment but will become our primary story all the flooding that we're going to be talking about as we had through the coming days with the heavy rain\nThat's right the the Ringo said he came right now looking up towards the north re looking toward the Blair's town area where we see is a lowering the camera kind of moving around just a little bit as well um there are some pretty gusty winds on the backside of these storms up words uh forty fifty miles an hour that could occur uh right now we're not seeing any reports of any kind of damage with that which is some very good news\nUm but that a particular storms down here on does have a history of producing some funnel clouds in the area and that continues to move to the north also want to pass long enough data Delaware county or a tornado warning has been allowed to expire they did not extend anything up\nIn the Clinton County area still seeing some rotation there but\nProbably because of the Manchester area did not produce anything um they're likely to and not be extending any sort of tornado warning up in the Clinton County so the bottom line is we've got a this tornado warnings to sell right here in the bank and county area I work on on getting the Vinton camera pulled up here\n'cause that's where the storm is moving to go back the next one right now the warning the guy is talking about is a bent and county warning that extends until four thirty against proportion of bent and count as is now north of Blair's town whether tornadoes reported earlier we had talked to Benton county emergency management and there are no reports of damage from the storm\nSo despite the tornado report no reports of damage which is great news that tornado again as we've seen\n'em in many of our storms and we've had moved through a throughout the summer and now into our fall season or the tornadoes have been short lived\nUm and have not produced a lot of the way of damage in most most instances so that's certainly what we want to have\n'em and you see that storm continues to move off toward the north or through the van horn area right now crossing crossing highway thirty as it moves off towards the north numerous schools\nUm have and I'm sure continue to hold students until that storm moves through the area than community and van horn certainly was holding students and continues to hold those students as well until that storm passes through so that they can safely get home\nUm get them all on the bus and get them safe as well in their cars as they move out again late season severe weather moving across eastern Iowa particular interest right now the storm that is moving through the van horn area\nI'm heading off to the north that will be getting close to the city of Vinton as well as at north where movement continues on a kind of take a look at ah where we're seeing some of the rotation inside that storm as well because you'll certainly get some torrential rains we said you get an inch very quickly it in an hour but let's look at that storm as it moves through areas of Benton county right now [noise]\nAnd you do certainly see some of that rotation just near the city of van horn\nHum you can see that extending back north of Blair's town right along highway thirty um that's the spot that we'd be watching very carefully for this storm new Korea what kind of movement has been on that storm um across Benson county in movement to the north\nAt twenty five miles per hour so it's not living in a terribly fast paced but is still continuing off to the north preventing county like you said that area of rotation right now is passing\nOut just between van horn and new hall but if you're in van horn a new all probably say that to get into your safe place still as well just about to cross over a highway to Eighteen and than county\nAnd will continue to watch that very carefully they score for the reporting worst watching social media as well I'm watching to see how these storms are moving when they're moving through the area so that we can kind of give you updates on any damage reports the thankfully we haven't had any\nUm storm track on the rotating part of the storm moving through Benton county in about twenty six Anderson working for three to Vinton about four thirty three so that takes that another thirty minutes or so Ford heads toward the city of Vincent\nIt seems like when things have consolidated down here um that tends to lower the thread a little bit ah which is good news not to say we couldn't see more severe weather it's night\nBut it does appear like will be in a position as we go forward here this evening and overnight that it's mainly heavy rain and perhaps a little bit of strong wind here or there they stormed selling kick a county that's the most recent a tornado warning to sell that goes officially until four thirty here this afternoon\nAnd that does include north English at all so officially includes Williamsburg and so I Will be back with them Ringo city can here after a while as this continues to lift\nTowards the towards the north northeast will keep on following along with a sick and he said he can as well um and then farther up towards the north from there another tornado warning highlighted for you in a central sections of Benton county the national weather service has trend that back\nAh for the most part here a to a very small area Vinson is still included but I can tell you that the velocity data suggest that if anything comes out of this it's probably going to be somewhere between Vinson and shells Burke because this is where the rotation is largely at at this point\nI'm right in here right around east sixty fifth straight to Eighteen just to the east of two Eighteen and that intersection in particular as it keeps on going towards north what I Will do is I'll slow the loop down for you\nKind of found this a rotation frame by frame here as it comes up into this area and it's not getting any stronger that's the good news is not getting any stronger but uh\nFactors are there that we could wind up getting a brief funnel that could happen\nWith this particular storm to farther down towards the south what I'm going to work on doing here is moving our cigarette he said he came over a little bit and get you a new view of what's going on\nI'm In the control room we can go to um ... camera equipped and we'll go back to radar this uh we have going on right here that's a very interesting view from are sick and he said he came at this point\nBrought lowering in the cloud basis um this right here um is definitely an interesting feature to note\nUh so we'll see what happens with that that does not appear to be rotating at this time it appears to be just hanging there at the moment so we'll keep an eye on that definitely nominate cloud formation but that's why the tornado warning was issued in northeastern kick back and we can see that from the sick and he said he can look in our way off towards the north and eighth\nAnd tell us something gets all the way down into here uh right now this is just the general severe thunderstorm that we have to deal with nothing has dropped any further than than what we have had so far on are sick and he said he can it looks a little more ominous than it did earlier um but the reason for that\nWarning that's been issued is for this area of rotation not to say that's not rotating on the ... cameras just tough to tell\nFrom our vantage point at Cedar Rapids this will be to the north of Harper and killed him now and then back up into the Ken Ross theory let's go back over to max one real quick um it is between south English and Wellman right now along highway twenty two but\nAgain that's the rotating part of the store and we just showed that there is no ground truth on this uh but all the same it it could drop a final down we've had a storm that's very similar to this earlier this afternoon I did have got an isolating funnel that happened\nA round them Ringo area that was one that we caught live on the air with that are going on and we'll we'll see what winds up happening here um with this particular storm sell uh this is a situation\nThough when you look at the height of the storm here around the cigarette area I'm there may be a little bit of hail there from Ken Ross and points north a specially as this continues to kind of develop and push its way northward\nAnd again across eastern Iowa we've been following for the past several hours are scattered areas of thunderstorms that are moving through the area give you a wide view right now if you happen to be just joining us now is we had a almost toward five Fifteen\nFor Fifteen for Fifteen sorry I'm thinking eastern time right now for fifth\nI'm as the storms continue to move through the tornado warning is in effect for portions of Iowa in ... county I'm as well as a thin sliver northwestern areas of Washington County in addition we still do have that tornado warning that continues across portions of Benton county\nUm and you'll notice that does extend now\nI'm away from van horn um it is as I mentioned to Vincent area that no real reports out of this storm other than earlier when I was there the Blair's town area where confirmed tornado was found those of you and eating right now I'm near ... over toward Vincent\nOr that's where the storm is progressing through a bitch and see what the weather service will do it the cell as it continues to move through northern areas of Benson and ultimately into northern areas of Linn county and just to show you\nUm that is still quite a ways away from the city of Cedar Rapids itself additional warnings certainly possible as these storms continue to move off towards the north had about thirty miles per hour or an average we had from twenty five to thirty five miles per hour moving on these storms and those two tornado warnings that still do remain in effect\nAcross the TV nine viewing area in Iowa Kirkuk a Washington until four thirty in addition we also have that warning for portions of Benson county that's in effect until forces\nOr the strengthening storm sell here on the cigarette the city can believe this is the first that we've seen something like this uh what you're seeing right now you can actually see the entire storm\nOn the cigarette he said hey can you can see the entire bounds of the storm but can you see kinda subtly there in your picture that the sky is changing color right from out here over to hear that's probably some hail that's falling can Ross is up in this area and I can Ross the hail core may have already moved over your area and there's no thing out there and this guy turns green that's a problem\nAnd one of the reasons why this guy turns green when they're sky around that is because there's ice present in that thunderstorm and when it's Seventy degrees eighty degrees down near the ground\nThat ice is in the form of hail so that's what we're seeing right now live on the ... corps probably right here now you'll notice it's kinda offset from where you think it might be in fact I think it might be over here but\nIn reality it's likely right in here so we're not seeing much of a lowering here but there could be some fairly decent hail in and around can Ross and then portions of extreme northeast section\nOf kick a county and then just to the southeast apart now as well so I just want to point that feature out to you that that we may have some some rather large hailed going on the spur decent hail around and just to the north again Ross\nDon McGahn storm reports in the last twenty four hours and mainly have involved some heavy rain as we know but we do see along with the heavy rain numerous markers of for tornado report certainly some of them have been this afternoon\nAcross areas of northern Missouri into south central areas of Iowa in the TV nine viewing area where of course have that tornado report near the Blair's town area that happened back at three forty eight a brief touched down um and again that's what we've seen with many of the tornados that have formed\nIn recent history uh they've been very brief in nature thankfully haven't cause much in the way of any damage and we hope that as the cases of this moment we have no damage reports into the TV nine newsroom or\nCorn meteorologist Corey Thompson has been watching the social media channels and not finding any damage reports coming from you as well which is good Jessup\nI'm In ... county one point three inches a twenty four hour total of rain um again we've had some heavier is rain in an hour oh we've had many areas these storms have passed through though isolated nature produce a an inch or more of precipitation and again\nI'm Bad heavy rain will add to the flooding situation that we have already and we'll be watching certainly what happens all the water as it moves through and there's more to come you looked farther off to the west I'm back off farther to the west we noticed areas of showers and storms of the main area of storms do right\nYou can see from northern areas of Iowa back across\nThe central area of the state particularly or across areas of Benson Iowa into areas of Washington in key a Cook County those are the areas of main concern right now as these storms have been a very isolated in nature and hasn't been saying all along that in county confirming no damage from the storm itself that includes a the tornado that briefly touchdowns when no damage reports\nAnd I haven't seen any of those are coming through on the\nOn the chat for the weather service either Korea anything at all that you've been able to discern from these storms as they've been living through\nA nothing new in terms of reports which like you said is great news we didn't know reports for the rest of the night I we would take it that's for sure\nSo the or weather coverage [noise]\nYou empty\nThis is continuous severe weather coverage on news radio six hundred W. M. T. and sit around foods as well as going to be searched five or ... country kitchen as why ... Rapids\nFor Nineteen we are following a a tornado warning that sooner factored so for thirty this afternoon\nFor Benton county so Vinton County has that severe or make that a tornado warning in effect for another ten minutes until four thirty this afternoon and then we also have a tornado warning but it's been a fact for northeastern Kirkuk\nNorth western Washington and then south eastern Iowa county that also doing until four thirty this afternoon as storms moved through the area\nAt about the speed of of twenty five miles per hour\nWhere to partner with our weather partner she be nine to bring you continuous severe weather coverage\nTime of day is very good with the storms because at night yes and you can't help but right now watching our city cams other than the funnel cloud that we saw the Ringo city camp and the reporter the tornado and Blair's town we've had no other\nFunnel cloud reports son or damage reports across these trials are still pretty impressive storm or our cigarette nieces against\nIs and it does still have some rotation to it but the thing is is we're looking at it right now and go over to max to hand there's there's really a right now even though it is rotating that's not a guarantee that it's going to do anything other than\nProbably produce at least some hail north of Ken Ross into extreme northeast corner of kick ... county and then getting into the southeast corner of Iowa county as well so if anything were to develop we're looking north and east from the cigarettes\nOn news radio six hundred WMGK in Cedar Rapids as well as Ninety six five kiss country\nWe have for information concerning the bench and county tornado warning that will be allowed to expire at four thirty the storm which prompted the warning as we can below severe limits and no longer appears capable of producing a tornado\nThis according to the national weather service therefore the warning is going to be allowed to expire however gusty winds and heavy rain or still possibility with this thunder storm\nSo the tornado warning has been allowed to expire for east central Ventura County it will expire at four thirty tornado watch remains in effect for Benton as well as Lynn and Johnson counties\nThat goes until nine o'clock this evening meaning there's the possibility for favorable development of a tornado we're going to allow our station Ninety six five kissed country to break away at this point you will hear a any updated weather information available through the emergency alert\nSystem and this is not he's six five kids country for thirty two\nThis is your severe weather station news radio six hundred WMD were remaining with her whether partner up until four forty five because a team of county is under a tornado warning part of our coverage area for severe weather and we go to our weather partner chi benign once again\nHere in our map seem warnings that we have an effect\nI'm In the TV nine viewing area you'll notice just one tornado warning and it will get that pinpointed for you in just a second and team a county but notice back down to a loan either additional warnings guess what there's more storms and lifting off to the north so it's something we're all watching probably deal with as we head through the evening hours an additional tornado warning has just been issued\nThis sort of clue the areas of Iowa in Johnson county want to stress first of all\nThis does not include much in Johnson county mostly Iowa City sold and you were not included I wanted to show your first those view in Johnson county that are included it is a thin sliver of northeastern areas are northwestern areas in Johnson county Oxford toward Amanda\n... as we head into Iowa county that's the area including this warning so again\nMore the anguish Iowa City Seoul and you are not included core value or not included in this warning for Johnson county so if you're sirens sound it's because they're not zone to be able to sound in certain areas\nYou are not included in this warning warning mainly as across areas of Iowa county stretching from wrangle when those ... are now on the western side\nAnd then as we head north up toward Amanda on the eastern and northern extent of the warning itself and that's the same song that they just cancelled the warning on\nYeah earlier and then I'm kinda getting it ran back up again but that that situation too\nAnd this is a good educational time here for people in Johnson county because what happens is when you get a sliver of the county to warn like that all weather radios will go off for Johnson county so north liberty Iowa City core avail the tornado part of the storm is clear off to your west by\nA good ten Fifteen miles we're keeping an eye on it and certainly in northwestern sections in Johnson county we most definitely will [laughter]\nUm but that that's the reason why the terrain and warning is out for the northwestern sliver\nOf Johnson county here at this point and that official tornado warning goes until five Fifteen [laughter] same motion on these other ones is has actually slowed a little bit now I'm moving north it only twenty miles an hour or so we might be seeing hairs and I've seen a low pressure system itself this feeling that start to slow down\nAnd we're going to be transitioning more towards the heavy rain throughout fall thread most definitely through the overnight [noise]\nAgain the latest tornado warning want to stress for 'em in the eastern half basically of Iowa accounting and just the thin sliver of northwestern Johnson county this doesn't include the man has long I weigh one fifty one does include the city of Williamsburg\nPrompted by a a a wall cloud report 'em down near par now I'm the movement on that has been to the north has mentioned it about twenty miles per hour so go ahead and put a little a storm track on it for you once again give you an idea\nOf how that storm is moving and when it will move into your area of 'em but again slowing down a little bit also is he still has moved through then expect those reins to last a bit longer\nAnd as a result we are going to continue to see that possibility of some heavy rains across theory as it moves the homestead or that should be around hosted in the man is about five\nSix teens who again around five in all of that storm looser this will be cross any\nIt's a time of day when people are heading home from work\nI'm now for the next hour hour and a half or so I'm keeping in mind I knew were mentioned that earlier um if you're listening to us on our radio partners and we do appreciate that and we appreciate all of our radio partners for taking the scenes that we do have across eastern Iowa and getting them out to you of severe weather coverage\nUm you want to watch very carefully and know where you're at and no one of those storms are at\nAnd certainly give yourself plenty of time we'd rather for you to be safe\nThan sorry as that storm continues to move off towards the north\nAnd one thing we don't want you to do is to park your car on during an underpass because what you do there\nIn that situation is is you put yourself in danger because not only drivers can't see you because it may be raining heavily um they also put yourself in a situation where the wind can actually funneled through their\nUh even at a greater rate so that the best opportunity here and there along interstate eighty a basically just to the east of the ... uh probably close to the test an exit anywhere in there\nOr if you if you pull off the interstate try and find a gas station or something it's a little more of a safe area as opposed to trying to to do this on the shoulder because you put yourself in a lot of danger by doing that you think about the cars going around Seventy miles an hour a day sometimes it doesn't even matter whether it's raining was some drivers will do\nSo out and get yourself off the interstate or if you if you want to get out of this thing because\nAh down to the southeast of ... where it's rotating but I tell you the trench rain is there and I drove in with someone that torrential rain at a on three eighty Scott coming in about two forty five and it was\nA plenty to slow traffic down about forty miles an hour or so it it's okay to take a break just do it safely and get off the interstate and do that\nThe tanker outlet mall in a ... bird taking shots\nTo having a heart I Will I have to show I I mean yes they're having them fixed shelter that's good I'm proud of looks like the storm's going to move just off to your south east however you are officially in the morning\nAnd take those warnings seriously and we appreciate the fact that they are taking that warning seriously and getting people to a safe shelter if you're ever out of business or someplace that says hey\nWe've got a warning in effect need to go to the shelter they're just doing it for your protection I'm so makes you know don't obey that don't try to go to the storm try try to run the storm don't try to go find the storm um there are professionals out doing that in fact almost too many people now with the advent of cell phones and everybody having a camera continually with them\nSo certainly um something you need to uh watch for know exactly what you're looking for as little storms are moving through and no and this was several\nYears ago the Pentagon warning went into effect and know where the warnings and effect\nRight and this particular case where we are hearing reports and the sirens going off in Johnson county and once again we want to just kind of reiterate where this tornado warnings storm is on the city of Iowa City need not take shelter I'm saying the core of el same with north liberty same with on\nThe warning itself is over in here and so yes it does encompass a sliver of Johnson county but it does not encompass any part of the Iowa City metro area the sirens are sounding\nI Know that sometimes creates a conflict with what's going on here because of the outdoor warning system found\nYet that metro areas not involve that part of the process a off towards our west\nThat is where it is and it's highlighted for you for your convenience they're\nAsked to tell where that tornado warning is actually at so as you mentioned Joe it's a really good indication in fact the first alert weather app provided by us we'll show you that exact morning and you can pinpoint it right on your own right on your phone to say yes I'm In that warning are no I'm not in that warning so I'm Iowa City core avail\nRight now you're not in the warning or at least not in this morning I'm so at this point out business can continue on as usual and the Iowa City court they'll north liberty areas\nUm to warnings that remain in effect than we've got a a picture we're going to show you all of a law called earlier um the warning that guy was talking about a thin sliver of northwestern Johnson county\nUm and then as we head into Iowa county Manama Ringo Williamsburg par now you're included in that warning this was issued based on a report of a wall cloud and the Cornell area\nAnd I understand coming up we'll have a picture that to show you that we have that picture available now force\nThere it is there's the a picture of the wall you can see the lord and I mean it's it's what we've been showing you I'm as these storms have moved through the area I don't know if we can get this on the wall or not is it possible [noise]\n\nSo you do see where the just look for the darker and grain right in the center of your picture\nComing down toward the ground that's the wall cloud that was seen with the storm and that's why the warning was issued as this storm is moving through as we head back to ... won the second warning that's in effect also a tornado warning of the reason we continue on the air\nThis for team accounting and it's the southeastern corner of Pima County so it does not officially a clue the city of Tampa storm itself now I'm In the northern portion of this warning eventually see what the weather service does\nAs that storm continues to move through just near the long point area I'm off to the west the elder on moving on this storm has been to the north are about twenty miles to twenty five miles per hour\nThe storm itself is going to get very close to the city of ... here but I tell you are not officially under the warning\n'em as that storm continues to move off towards the north as we said some heavy rain certainly expected along with some areas of whitening all the lightning has not been incredibly president of the storm but also just one hail report earlier and that was down in Kyoto as those stores moving through portions of care Cook County if you're just joining us\nYou know what I mean that was allowed to expire at four forty five\nThe storm which prompted the warning weakened below severe limits and no longer a fierce capable of producing a tornado there for the warning is going to be allowed to expire tornado watch go uh for a sit around with cyber city in all counties offshore west and north\nOr under a tornado watch until nine o'clock this evening tornado warning still active until five Fifteen this afternoon that is for\nA small sliver northwestern Johnson county we want to emphasize that the ah been doing a pretty good job of doing that with TV nine it's just the extremely small sliver of northwestern Johnson county not as such a way of\nLike in North liberty or ... or Iowa City they have a your populated areas of Johnson county it's also this tornado warning in effect for eastern Iowa county\nAnd um the storm track could just about five minutes should be going through the Williamsburg area ... about five ten and a man or at five Fifteen if you're on I ...\nIn Iowa is biomarkers to twenty to twenty eight I eighty mile markers to twenty to twenty eight under this tornado warning\nThat is a for eastern on what county and just a small sliver of northwestern Johnson county uh let's see I just feel well let's go a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was near par now about forty miles southeast marine go moving to the north\nOr forty miles per hour this is your severe weather station news radio six hundred WMGK in Cedar Rapids now back to a continuous severe weather coverage with her with a partner to be not a\nBecause that one is really slow down over the past Fifteen to twenty minutes and that's likely going to produce at least one inch of rain\nAnd forces of Crawford county and you just mentioned that new up day for the Mississippi and to be able to do with some of the heavy rains here in fact the I look at it from the soil data out there in northeast Iowa about Seventy five percent saturation so lots and lots of run off with the storms as well get a rainbow you're captured\nI Do want to see it lets you max to we'll see and I said a rainbow that that's a bright and everybody's mood doesn't that's there it is right there on the north Liberty City can I turn that away from the storm just so you can kind of said a little bit there because we aren't seeing anything else that in terms of storm structure here I'm at this particular juncture or whether it be from from Williamsburg or interstate eighty [noise]\nUh but we'll see what happens okay find watching it most definitely that keeps on working its way north\nAlong the cedar river in Cedar Rapids and let me take a look at our hide your drive people asking what's that Chris Dodd has been updated slightly about Eighteen point six Saturday evening to an earlier crashed on by a little bit Saturday evening at Eighteen points [noise]\nThat does push it into major flood stage animal than low interest major flood stage overnight for friday into friday morning\nStays a major flood stage into late Monday before just drop down the moderate flood stage show again that's the latest hydro fracking the cedar river again that includes the forecast for this one that's coming through right now again [noise]\nHas to be watched so because it is a forecast and where are you going to predict those five to six years rainfall told you could see in spots could certainly change this forecast as well so something that we definitely do we need to keep in mind [noise]\nUm otherwise that's about the extent of it here and this is going to continue through five Fifteen [noise] um we'll keep an eye on this um the national weather service is not planning to drop this warning anytime soon\nBecause it's still as just a real real borderline structure to it or that has not produced anything um to not worthy so far I guess there was one hail report I'm back in northeastern sections of kick ... county but in terms of a tornado report this particular thunderstorm has not done that a but what it has done\nIs produced a fair amount of rainfall and now you're going to get a a a pretty good down for coming up on all the amount of colonies and there may also be a little bit of hail with that too it does have a history of producing that so [noise] um even though we're not talking probably a tornado in this situation\nAt least most likely not to the fact that we do wind up ah with the fact that we do have some hail and the and the storm cellar small and then maybe it is something that I think will want to keep an eye for the ...\nThe tornado warning that was for southern areas of tame a county has now been updated and moved farther to the north a new tornado warning now in a second until five thirty until five thirty this will encompass the eastern portion\nOf Pima County into the north eastern portion of tame a county just north of the city of clue the tears just off to the east of the city of trailer again this was a training warnings and affects\nOfficially until five thirty has that storm or sores rotation of tornado as possible [noise] we're gonna leave coverage shortly runner and it was all but it will be back with our news at five [noise]\nThis is news radio six hundred WMD tea in Cedar Rapids it's continuous severe weather coverage here on your severe weather station now five o'clock in the afternoon and uh we have a tornado warnings that are in fact in fact are growing\n\n\nCounty or the north eastern portion of the Pima County that's in effect until five thirty this storm that was that prompted the tornado warning by rotating wall cloud earlier as that storm was willing to the north out of power Sheikh entertainment county and now continues to move off towards the north east at about twenty miles per hour in that storm itself\nNear the city of ... here [noise] um that's kind of where we are seeing that tornado warning at the present time that in effect until five thirty\nIn addition it looks like we may have a new tornado warning also in effect this will cover\nA small portion of policy county and follow it to the west in Jasper County [noise] power she counting as soon as the area that is included it does not include the city of Grinnell as you can see it includes highway one forty six in the extreme\nSpot a warning on a tornado warnings you need to be in your safe place now and you know that's safe place at the lowest level you can get to a meteorologist Corey Thompson has joined us today and it was on his first day here with our solar storm team a what a day to begin corn and what have you been finding as you've been kind of taking a look at the storms and as well as watching social media channels\nAre very similar to what you guys have been talking about up there at the weather ... and we have\nA different looks at the wall clouds were seen our city can we can pull up that north Liberty City can again that shows what were tacked on backs to right now down next to if we could see that that shows what we're talking with that lowering the clouds we're not seeing a funnel cloud there right now but that's something that uh many viewers have reported\nA no official tornado reports again nothing new that we haven't talked about yet a sense then which is good news so while we have a lot of warnings today reports of as you and far between which is something I'm ... we're not upset about here in the weather on no not at all and that would be just fine to have no reports it all again we're watching\nThe storm a limited him another way that we watch or storms by taking out the teen mobile weather while the mobile weather right now driving through areas of dense and counting as I understand if\nI'm watching the storm as well that's a live pictures of over whether lab is out\nUm again we're watching that same storm cell that's moving across areas\nOut of Vinton County heading into northern areas of Linn county kind of watching to see exactly what would happen but on a rural Vinton County right now the mobile weather lab taking a look at that storm as well I'm Alive as we can see right there and will continue to watch that as the storm moves and involved and pushes across eastern Iowa\nI'm it's early October\nWe think out here whether in spring we might think a little severe weather in summer major outbreak of severe weather all the damage was thankful in October\nIn October and river flooding also which is going to be a big headline in the coming days\nAnd we enjoy our newscasts were going to run down your river levels as well some time in our coverage\nYeah we'll get to it ah but ah right now our immediate focus is on a couple of days terms I I've\nCouple of different tornadoes in October before um but we're up to at least our eighth or ninth warning now today and\nI'm the son just kind of needs to go down and we need to end this and hopefully at some point that that\nUm but yes we are at five twelve you normally be doing whether right now anyway Joe so it's OK here's Peter happened on the south city gambling are way down towards the or\nThe west if we can go to Maggie Webb thing right now is that it or they'll be coming\nOut of northeastern sections of Iowa accounting\nAnd living it's way up in the link county uh this is well I think most of the day and so when you see a lowering like this it obviously catches your eye on that it's a rather threatening sky at this point um what we have not seen much more than one instance of is a funnel cloud so there is the lowest part of the cloud right there\nBut we have not seen anything except for that marine go funnel cloud so far at least anywhere in our city can never we've seen a lot of wall cloud that look just like this\nI we've seen a lot of the um so far today and we're thankful to say that we have not seen any of these storms be able to consolidate any more\nThan what we've seen so far now which is very good news there's only two minutes left by the way on that tornado warning in northeastern sections of Iowa county we will see what the quad cities weather service would like to do with that uh I Know there was some some thinking that it could come up and do the portions of Linn county as well um given the rotation that is in place we do have\nUm some other storms not to talk about too with other warnings on them\nYeah we'll go out and run do all the warnings for you I Will begin down across areas of extreme northwestern Johnson county as well as Iowa county that's until five Fifteen and that's just about two minutes away it's kind of had mentioned storm itself that has been producing that rotation near the Amanda area\nUm again a little bit of a hook shape on that as you see as it moves toward the north certainly could indicates and continuing rotations us far\nThe weather service has not extended or told us what they will be doing with that warning as that storm moves into extreme southeastern vent and as well as other areas of Linn county uh this would be just off to the west of the eastern Iowa airport\nI'm a that's a new tornado watch will take a look at that as we move forward on the clock\nUntil ten o'clock likely including more counties not a surprise in northern team a county right now until five thirty you also have a tornado warnings in fact I'm oh go ahead and pinpoint that area this is now north of prayer I'm moving along highway\nJust off to the west of highway Twenty one on we'll go to the new tornado warning right now which is likely what we've been watching for an yes this is now a new tornado warning on and tell you the county's Benson Iowa Johnson and leaning counties now let's run down what portion of the warning in effect until six o'clock go again\nUntil six o'clock we'll start with the southern extended the storm where the storm is right now\nThis will include extreme northeastern areas of Iowa county in North western areas in Johnson county again in Johnson county this does not include north liberty Oxford or coups falls Iowa City or coral ville it moves off father to the north as we look farther to the north this does include the city of wall for\nIt is just off to the west of the eastern Iowa airport this doesn't include the city of Fairfax it does include the city of Atkins it doesn't include the city of Covington Robbins you are right on the line as well as ... as we pinpoint down that warning that's in effect\nIt will see that it does include Lynn junction it will include ushers sphere ushers ridge boulevard northeast and portions of Cedar Rapids the glass road northeast\nThe farther you go off toward the east again it does include Hiawatha this will include below the downtown area Cedar Rapids itself not included in this warning again payload included in that warning as well as you can see state park included wiki up hill natural area again the sirens going off in ... county\nAnd they will go for the entire county those around you right now in Marion you're not included in this warning\nThose have you over down to the south as we move down toward Mount Vernon not included in this warning Bergstrom not included in this warning Lisbon not included in this warning Springfield not included in this warning elborn at Central city Condon prairie bird Alice center point Walker at this time not included in the morning\nAnd as far as the city and Cedar Rapids western areas of Cedar Rapids are included in this war re are\nPleased tuned to mediate ... cable channel twenty two for detailed emergency alert information\nWas again just to give you some idea another way you can find out if you're ever including the warnings was subscribe to the nines whether call we give you a phone call if you are in exact geographic location is included in the morning that's another tornado warning in effect until six o'clock\nYou know the other thing I'm going to say to about just being situation Leah where uh you know we had a situation several weeks ago when the sirens came out and and some some smart phones weren't\nGetting the warning and people were concerned as to why their phone didn't get that warning to tell you what these smartphones they follow you right they go right down to the GPS if you're in Marion right now and your phone knows you're in Marion it may not go off with a warning it it knows where you are\nA which is the same situation as that where that ... the siren system\nIs county wide is county wide and and that that continues a so obviously you're hearing some sirens where there is no immediate threat of severe weather that's really where we come in to try and and tell ya where exactly this morning is going to be in and who has the most danger basically of where these tornados rather than the thunder storm is going to be\nA we have to vantage points of this particular storm cells that lifts up and the ... county are north city cameras located in one of the highest point from the county it's on top of mount ... university looking back towards the south and west we can see the entire scope\nOf lowering right now so what you're seeing here is extremely heavy rain and maybe some areas of small hale\nWhat you're seeing over on on the other side this is where the lowering as that and right now there's nothing to suggest that anything is going to be dropping out of this at this time however will keep an eye on it for you as as we go forward so they Doppler radar indicated tornado but I can tell you that our city can network is not confirming anything\nAt this point we also have another vantage point of the same storm sell 'em which is also on our Cedar Rapids south that he can which has been a little bit more because it's simply closer to the storm so right now\nI'm so we're keeping an eye on this and that anything drop obviously we're going to see it live here on TV nine but otherwise right now it's just it's been the same story so far today it's just been wall cloud after wall cloud and a couple of funnels here and there\nWere going around on all the warning was again that we do have an effect because there are numerous and all of them in a TV nine viewing area are under a tornado warning so here we go in northern areas of Alan ... county we have a tornado warning that continues until five forty five\nAgain all the warnings that we have right now our radar indicated rotation and storms that could lead to tornadic formation or continue to watch that hand over your included in this warning Lansing the solo you\nKnow this warning it's the extreme northwestern areas county as we get farther down to the south\nWill notice them scattered areas of showers and storms that are certainly with us as we move across the eastern Iowa they will become more numerous and more widespread I'm as we had\nFor the evening and into the overnight hours bringing the heavy rains threat which we'll talk about on the second tame a county or those of you in the box so it's going to die users are just off the east of treasure just stopped usa Buckingham um we do notice that we have a tornado warning the fact that really looks like the storm itself in the rotation is\nJust about to highway nice sixty five as a loose to the north and continues to move to the north this would take it I'm into southern areas of Black Hawk county of movement continues we'll see what the weather service wants to do with that warning\nAnd I would say to say that warning has now expired\nCorrect okay so the only warning that we have an effect right now yeah same accounting warning also not extending the black hawk county the only warning we have it goes into six o'clock and that would include again portions of lens as well as the far far far eastern sliver\nOf Vinton County is that storm continues to move off toward the north and east up people asked yesterday I've got a couple of emails\nHey if you're on television and people want to follow your store uncovered how do they do that when they go to their shelter we can turn the volume up on the television or there are many other ways to follow our severe weather continuous coverage or you can download our first of all the weather up on your smartphone that it will provide streaming coverage as well as\nAs I was talking about earlier geo locate your location for warnings that do come out in addition you can also follow us on ... dot com on your tablets\nOn your laptop bring it with you when you go to your safe place in addition numerous radio partners take our severe weather coverage is well you'll want to do that maybe on an app run a radio as well as take a look at social media and that's where he like you to report some of those damage reports as well as we do see something move across the street I Would I Would say this is one of the longest times that\nI've ever been on the air with tornado warnings and it absolutely zero\nZero damage reports which is the way you want to do it because I think this yet so I Know I I Know but they are absolutely no damage reports from any of the storms and we've had numerous warnings out\nThis is going to say nine o'clock it's actually goes until ten o'clock they had extended that watch just the bed\nBut that's just to accommodate some of the storms that we're moving through tornado watch in the facts and strong when possible as some of the storms made me kind of conglomerate a little bit later although looks like mainly turning into more of a heavy rain event after the system passes and the next couple of hours has at sunset says kind mentioned but that tornado watches and effect speaking of heavy rain\nJust want to cover this real quickly a heavy rain risk exist for now all the way through tomorrow morning into the early part of the afternoon tomorrow notice it is elevated to moderate across eastern Iowa over an inch and many locations in some spots of already seeing that and you'll see more\nAnd locally two inches or more because we have the least under storms produce an inch very quickly as they move through the area\nThat produces of course flash flooding risk an aerial flooding risk across the area and a river flooding risk on the ... the Iowa English and the skunk\nI'll just a quick glance at the cedar river just kind of give you some of the flood stage and joined us at five o'clock and looking for that\nI'm getting Charles city Janesville no problem at all um Cedar Falls looking for a crust of about Ninety five point two major flood stage that happens Saturday morning early warning looking for a minor ... Eighteen eight that happens friday morning\nOf Vincent you're going to see a modern crafted Eighteen six that happens friday evening Cedar Rapids the updated now Eighteen point six that happens Saturday evening that's a major crash\nAnd sixteen point eight and ... that happens Tuesday Morning right now at Fifteen Twenty one both of those in the moderate flood stage couple of other rivers and we'll get back to our warnings and the fact\nOf the north ... heading toward major stagecraft expected friday morning that a twenty two point five\nIn addition along the Mississippi getting through minor flood stage up to about Seventy nine in Dubuque\nThat happens Tuesday Morning at seven o'clock marine going along the Iowa river bouncing around major flood stage for the next several days nineties\nIt happening on Thursday is down in Iowa City in the release of water from the reservoir\nLooks like about twenty two point nine that happens Tuesday Morning and that would take it into some minor flood stage area and the final let's take a look at the English river and cologne up I'm generally going to stay moderate now as we head into the early part of the week and then it fall off Eighteen point eight kind of the highest as we've seen\nHas removed from the past couple of days Thursday morning getting back to about Eighteen ate\nOver on max to really quick here but we're looking at right now is the radar picture over primarily Linn county at this point and one of the reasons why we're doing that\nIs this storm is lifting up into an existing storm and for the most part it looks like it ought to be able to do that without too much of an issue um however sometimes when these little cells get together like this they can enhance their rotation a little bit\nUm over the past half an hour or wherever they had these initial cells come across Walker and center pointed that other smaller to the east of an corn as it moves its way to the north\nWould not be surprised if it left a little boundary behind um perhaps right through here there could be a little boundary there on radar and that may cause this to perhaps try and spin again we'll see what happens but right now\nUm there's no sign of doing that in fact wall cloud is actually becoming a little bit flatter at this point I'm so we'll see winds up happening moving our way forward\nAh right now the eastern side of Cedar Rapids has picked up essentially nothing with this particular tornado warning in fact the storm is they nearly perfectly within the tornado warning box\nUm as well in fact the eastern side of the uh the entire Polly Dunn has hardly received any rainfall at least with this storm I Know we did earlier now but at least at this storm a lifting straight towards north northeast now\nThe location that will be impacted by this and this is still probably going to pre create some pretty good wind\nAround here in fact the leading edge here I'm moving out of Cedar Rapids up through the robin's area and then eventually up just to the west of central city here so ah places like mid way of getting up towards the Alice area and Robbins area um that'll be coming up in your direction and right now the tornado threat appears extremely low\nOn this but it's not non zero that makes sense there there is a threat there that's not a great threat but there is a threat there and will continue to keep on a Washington City Kansas as well as this continues to lift to the north\nWe did have a report and now I'm of the stony point area um along west post wrote an F avenue of some from\nWall cloud right wall cloud more effort in and get some pictures of that and we also have been reports\nOn the panel area of the fire spotters there are reporting a rotating cloud rotating wall cloud we've been showing it also as we've been watching it as well in our city can so they can for those reports we certainly appreciate that a lot um it's very helpful to us to know what that storm is doing\nAnd we'll see what happens as we move through all the next half hour or so it will tell a lot again until six o'clock then warnings in effect for ... county it looks like mainly across Linn county right now is that storm still moves off towards the north\n... watches it gets north of Cedar Rapids to see what happens I'm as it gets up toward the robins air and particularly up towards center point Urbana area to see what the storm will do so far and\nPorts of wall clouds but no reports of any tornadoes or damage has that storm has been pushing through\nJust going to get a little bit tighter on some of the velocity here on the north west side of town a basically between Covington ends in Cedar Rapids so\nHighly one hundred there's the extension right there on that goes all the way across so it's going to be somewhere right in here that that lowering is that now and we've been watching it on the city can now for a while and we have not seen anything that's been aside from a wall cloud which of course is important\nUm to take note of because that does that suggest that there is something that is trying to drop out of this um but otherwise that we've not seen anything more notable than that in fact there's the rotation right now I'm In fact if you look up here I'm On our our north city can\nGet some video we want to take a look at it from the exact location you were talking about so that's kind of look at the video and see [noise]\nAbout the same by the same thing they're a little bit of rotation there are but thankfully it's nine rotating a lot right which is good I was very very good ... we we should have visibility on this um all the way up even just beyond halo with this particular wall cloud on the north cameras\nWatch this video and people are watching you point out if you can turn your own fearful and horizontally and shoot the video that really helps 'cause that's the shape of your TV screen and we can see even more of the sky so just a thought turned that sold horizontally and get us some video we appreciate that a lot but horizontal video when really help us out like the picture we're seeing right there which gives you a wide view of the sky\nYeah I mean we have a lowering their and I know it looks kind of threatening to you but I'm there has not been anything from this\nRight now and I mean we've seen several little rings as a storm young and now the one and he's the one in ... um the situation there you go through the ringer was also very similar to this where you wind up having um some funnel happening now this is also a situation you have a small storm like this and extremely humid\nEnvironment it's not out of the realm of possibility that you're going to see some southern strong wind\nMaybe on the order of fifty five sixty miles an hour or so um if the storm does recycle if it does regenerate if it does intensify uh we would have the potential here of seeing at least a little localized little localized wind damage from it um but right now that may not be tornado related that maybe more of a downer situation\nI'm In this particular case and again the ground is extremely soaking wet and so [noise] ah well what's something adjusting hurts highlighted even yesterday at the er\nAt the new the five was the fact that any strong storms that come across may have some stronger when gas and may also have an easier time toppling trees just because of how how what the ground is but uh where do you continue to follow it here I'm working our way to the north and west now so\nI'm the storm itself is just northwest of the Hiawatha area\nAnd that is where the the rotation is on radar and that's what we're seeing live on the city can network and again our north camera on a clear day now we're seeing well beyond pay low even in the shells Bergen sometimes I'll whip center point on this camera\nI'm On a day like today it there'll be a little more restrictive a but we should be able to see it leads to Todd hill or maybe even all the way to Albert that we saw the central city tornado last year on the north cameras though\nI'm this should keep us convert through most of Linn county from this particular view and if this thing gets a tornado in it or we're going to wind up seeing it here because there aren't any additional storms at least in the immediate vicinity of Linn county at this time a west northwest of Cedar Rapids in high ... that's the only cell that's in the county right now there is no small", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Simon Conway", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "09"}
