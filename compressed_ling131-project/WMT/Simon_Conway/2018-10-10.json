and so it it it's been really beneficial in your having me on the way\nWe we've been ... years but\nYou know you were going to have a debate I guess right here hopefully not but\n[laughter] I mean I ... so we know roughly\nSpeaking where they stand on the on the issues right we know where the governance that I've been putting this out I I think this time there is if you say that the that there's a clear choice between Republican and Democrat\nI Know where you're coming from and I'm coming to you or\nIt's really stuck this time stark differences uh whereas sometimes the lines get blood you know if you're pro life for example\nOr the governor is is the person you vote for because a friend Hubble is proudly are connected to Planned Parenthood so right I mean so that's a stark choice completely different Fred ... says it's going to get rid of tax cuts that side of the governor signed into law last year\nA stark difference where were you on just those two issues as well\nSo you know there are differences between the two of them that's for sure I think there are mainly but yeah it's equally bad for different reasons but still like her bed and so my you know idea was going to be that we're going to talk about issues that are ignored such as many boards and agencies the state has it also um you know the things that criminal justice reform or completely\nI'm going to let you get to them but I asked you a question you coming to the studio way too many times to think you're going to get away with that right and so on those two issues whether you said let's let's stop them and then we'll go from that\nI think you asked a abortion first of All right yeah so I Do think we should ... that's one thing I'll agree with the heartbeat bill that isn't the going through the courts right now when you get overturned but that's kind of word that stands right now I'm you know as far as funding at something I think we can do right away this station not take your tax dollars\nAnd then pay something that you're completely morally opposed to so that you believe it was ... the states should not take your tax dollars to do that for them\nTo what about tax ... says are we going to numerous times saying that they have to ah is gonna rip pillows\nI Want to go through and I want to actually address spending some my problem with the tax cuts like there was some fundamental problems with that one is it never address the spending so we've cut taxes but we haven't really cut taxes we've shifted the tax burden a little bit so we're not going to accept some online purchases we're not going to exempt look\nAnd so we moved to Texas around without actually looking at the spending so the only way you're actually going to get tax cuts from this\nLong term is if the revenues go up for things like sales tax\nIn our economy grows in the state brings in more tax revenue\nThat doesn't happen without spending I would've got spending that take a look at tax cuts and I actually also want to go through and look at things like corporate welfare I wasn't even playing field for businesses will say I don't think we should do things like the research activities tax credit you know where the state's many cases giving a corporate welfare too large financially\nSet I wrote this and I I completely agree with you accept a you have to get the other states to agree otherwise we get nothing because ah as I was told Debbie ... to her face in this studio she is the head of legal bribery and the state of Iowa\nThat's a job right ah and ah and I'm sure various corporations have are heads of legal shakedowns but the problem is if you don't play that game then they're going to go to willy nilly who do play that game who will give them a whole bunch of uh a tax breaks if we don't play that game that come in here\nIt's that simple I don't want to I don't want to focus too much I Want to move on because you said something very important to me as well we have way too many boats and the state\nAbsolutely so even the Des Moines Register's writing a editorials now you know I never thought I'd see the day and they're putting out of the tourists that agree with me but uh you know even they've been doing his best men are not taught outlaw all that well we don't know that\nThey are put out at its worst thing that we've got three over three hundred state boards and agencies many of which have been there for a decade I no longer a proof much of a point\nMaybe they did years ago but they can be consolidated eliminated made more efficient there's also some things that we look at like what the state does if we look at just for example of technological infrastructure we have state websites for every agency and departments are let's combined them all under one make it easier to find stuff but all of our security so there is an upfront cost to it\nBut you give it a couple of years it pays for itself\nWhat right because how many departments of their own Ninety people will pay and part of these websites looked like they were designed into going out to I mean security issues and everything else yeah really genuinely really awful absolutely awful [laughter] okay so uh if you were on stage tonight to and you got to the uh the big last\nQuestion what is the one thing that you would do what would be the one thing\nFirst thing I'm going to do would be to look over at a all these words and agencies so when we just talked about okay we're going to go through because the governor's no said the recommended budget so governor ... going to have that recommended budget so where do you have a full year to look at this go through every ... every agency line by line every department find out what can be consolidated eliminated and then made more efficient\nAnd go through and then present that proposal so it's going to be the biggest thing right there that I Would get across\nSomething or you someone who believes in zero based budgeting [noise] I think everything should be justified yes I think that uh now which\nSo we ... we're not going to say OK department of education wrong and say OK department of education we know we gave you a ... billion dollars last year but we're starting this year with zero justify every time I think\nWe should know of course also coming from the understanding the governor is not a dictator and has to Penn there were things that legislature so they're gonna they're gonna be pushed back there you know I don't like to make\nMore and more local you program charities and economic development and any
