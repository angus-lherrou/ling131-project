I Know they would because otherwise politician and do it you'll becoming a politician but I just got in case you aren't aware that we really hate it\nHate it so here's here's what we've done in this race and I and I was asked um this question by the way really newspaper quite a while ago they said well you pledge not to go negative and I wonder if there was this [laughter]\nI've spent the last eight years in the attorney general's office indicting people when they do something bad that's talking publicly about uh intentional acts that they made that are bad K. right\nI Will never shy away from educating people about my opponent's record when I Do it I Will do it in a way that isn't menacing [laughter] you know it's not scary it's just statements of facts of what has happened I think the voter education is important nasty though\nIf it if you think it's nasty and then you think it's ...\nYou said you weren't going down and went bad but I Do I Do think is that the yeah I was sick of it the greatest invention I Believe in the last five years is the study second fast forward button on a TV [laughter]\nI agree 'cause I watch nothing live anymore anyway but I almost nothing I live it's actually the question I just hit those buttons a whole bunch of\nTimes yeah my wife and I uh watch watch very little TV we actually cut the ... cut the cord awhile ago we'd get a broadcast and then\nOther than that we are streaming and so it's great we don't have to watch any of us at all no I actually got my oil yesterday and I saw one of my ads for the first time\nIn life are All right well are we covered that we covered those couple of things to your opponent has also a ... or ... what she says it will cost us if you become the state or a she says\nShe says if the state ordered to it cannot be a CPA shocked any moral for him I guess it's called a CPA exam anymore and therefore a whole bunch of the older you have to be outsourced and that's going to cost us five million if you cost ...\nUh well it's a lie so there's no reason to which ...\nThat's a very good question because specifically both let's start with the first part but they have to get outsourced\nThree current elected county attorneys that are all Republicans as well as a former state party chair have also that's not true but you know whoever is elected suit on her condition the ... the second part is interesting too though this five million dollar figure because\nYou can go on the website for the non partisan Iowa league of cities and they say that the cost for CPA firms ranges from about fifty to maybe a hundred and fifty a hundred and eighty dollars an hour and my opponent in her interview with the Cedar Rapids 'cause that said the state ... office building about eighty dollars an hour\nSo number one it's not true the F to outsource them but number two even if you did have to outsource them their firms that do it more cheaply than these new orders office does\nNot get a we have rub sand in Studio he wants to be our state or the ... asking him a few a few questions about uh about that\nUh we live in really nasty dangerous times than me it's pretty disgusting it is I'm Glad to hear you say that um we had a we had a cola last night nothing ... nobody running for office we had a cold or last night uh\nTold us we I'll tell you how we got on to it in a second but said if she saw for example Sarah Huckabee Sanders having dinner with her family in Iowa and she was being harassed or she would sit back and watch it happen\nA immediately afterwards we had another person's self identified as a Democrat we have lots of Democrats listening to the show by the way I said that's disgusting he would intervene\nI was very pleased that he ... it was the very next uncle wait till I was really pleased he he cold because\nOtherwise we we end up with this opinion more and more Democrats are becoming the mold mhm so let me deal with a couple of the more questions in the last a few weeks we've had some really disturbing things we've had Eric Holder saying if they go low we kick him\nA with a hub Maxine Waters wanting wanting people to do exactly what I just described to seek out a Republican serving a the president harassed them in public places we've had Cory Booker say getting that faces we've had Hillary Clinton say you can't be civil I could go on and on as you well know\nThere is a real simple question he prepared to condemn that language\nYeah I don't think you should say that you should get people on the show ends or because there should be a recognition of the fact that well you and I are sitting here relatively more to reality there are other people out there who are not and who took that sort of thing very literally\n... she said it because you know somebody's gotta cross that once I get it I you know when the president when he was a candidate there was a particular rally and that there was somebody that was going beyond killing\nAnd the president said was to the effect of roughly ... I don't remember what it was easy of course I condemn it and you know it's a matter of fact\nThere's actually this is something that came on really early when I was running a because social media is just awful and I I ... in ... I'll do this up on Twitter and I'll tweet or that you kind of I mean but\nI very early on would comment to my ... to people who are posting on my own post and they were calling a Republican names or if there were some saying something really ugly\nOr I Can't catch 'em all but there when I see it I say hey you don't need to do that is unacceptable we can find better ways of talking about this well I'll look that up and send it to you I\nI said some things on my I'm very committed to that I don't know if I can remember if we talked about this last time I was on but when I was in college actually put together a class on conservative thought okay ah because I think that we should be more able to have conversations with an understand ideas that are different from\nOur own I mean you know I'm I'm not a Republican I never been a Republican I Am a conservative so ideologically you and I are opposed but I can easily see us you know go and breaking bread together having a male they're talking about some of the issues of the day probably not convincing each other of anything\nAnd shaking hands and say see you next week for best your yeah your son a by\n... ... it probably would have been [laughter]\nUm and I can see how many friends who are Democrats yeah I Do that when yeah and that's showing ... we are we going to have\nMore of it you know I've always throughout my life tried to reach out or to have relationships with people who think differently for me frankly it's much more fun and it's much more enjoyable and it's I also think it's important because you have to

I was a in this building on this\nFor next to the coffee machine and I just pulled myself\nA cup of coffee and I thought man I'm going to for a while\nAnd that was the second time in five days that I had that feeling the first time lost about ten minutes and uh I thought of the time and whatever that was that I'd I'd eaten thank goodness that was out on my buddy because now feel ... and X. five days or a continued and I continued\nTo feel ... and then I'll tell you what to say is two thousand Seventeen two o'clock in the afternoon I no longer felt fine\nAnd unlike on October twenty fifth I could not get rid of that feeling of nausea so even though I was in the building that day I have to tell my boss that I was leaving\nI had to go home I hate that by the way\nAre you really can't do a radio show if you think ah after every fourth would\nYou are going to be physically sick\nSo I went home and uh snow down on the sofa with my uh muddled Reagan\nHe's a he's in there somewhere uh-huh my boy Reagan they looked to me\nLot of that boy\nAh and ah we fell asleep for like two hours and then when I woke up I had the tiniest twins it was certainly could not be co pay and right in the center of my chest and I thought oh I Do a good [noise]\nSo I'm going to go off to the pharmacy and get me some or you know they call the ... 'cause it's just a bug and I don't do that and I actually didn't date by like ... and then because I'm a fundamentally healthy guy at the time I didn't really have a family doctor apart from a walk in clinic\nWhich was office the\nAforementioned pharmacy so I thought you know if there is a bug those guys are going to know what it is\nBecause they say oh the walk and stuff and if it's something that uh you know an antibiotic will take care of my want me some of that\n\nSo I walked into their office and a ... actually the guy I Know the best the doctrine of the best\nMan somebody of a a gone shooting range with him that's always good and you're dumped by the way and ah and I told him I what happened to me over the previous five days and he said\nI think you're having a heart attack and I said shut up literally\n'cause that was my only symptom I was one listened to him and I had it twice in five days anyway because many kj gets me all the other test you can do in his office finishes ... tells me the ... perfectly normal\nComes back and then says every test I gave your tells me there's nothing wrong with you and I should send you home but I think having a heart attack not amazing I really think of my life to this guy\nSo he tells me about this blood test that I really need to have cars that will tell us absolutely categorically whether or not I had in fact had of hot flat\nAnd he could do a blood test box\n\nAbout how it would take in three days to get the results and that wasn't really much you see if I was indeed having a heart attack so we said you're going to go down to mostly\n\nSo I'm Still like dumbfounded I go down to must see a that tell they already are aware of my ... because he's been in touch with them um and they say yeah we think you have an ... and then I take blood and I come back about thirty minutes later and I say yeah you had a heart attack or five days ago\nAnd so after that\nThey admitted me because they said we think having a second attack right now but uh we can't tell you that we need to admit you and take more blood at about four o'clock in the morning so we'll wake you up we'll do that and then we'll let you go back to sleep when you wake up again at six o'clock in the morning we'll tell you if you had a second hottest that\nAnd I did\nBoth of them were very very mild\n\nI'm very lucky I was in hospital for two days I had to die stop so on day three I came out and decided I was not going to smoke that was a tough day let me tell you\nThe really tough day and so\nI got through it\nI was now three days smoke free on today I'm a ... year smoke free for whatever reason I been smoking for a long time\nAnd I've tried many many times before to quit smoking\nAnd it's tough and I failed each and every time\nFor some reason day for two days in a hospital one day out of the hospital they fall\nWas easy and it's been easy every single day since then I cannot tell you why I have no idea why\n\nBut that is the reality so today is day I refer to his my life day this is it twelve months down the road doing much better\nAnd a smoke free for you actually asked uh what I should do with the last pack of cigarettes that has been ... on my kitchen table with a lighter on top of them\nFor a year I needed to be there if it was mood for you know cleaning I actually panicked just a little bit which is just not me I just needed to know that they were right that very strange\nSo anyway ah that is a that's what happened to me in the last twelve months and I'm very grateful to uh be hair a thought about framing it as somebody a offered to do a mature into a pipe for white or somebody else had a great suggestion\nWhich was to remove a office smokes fill it with a ton of right take it down to a farm and yours is
