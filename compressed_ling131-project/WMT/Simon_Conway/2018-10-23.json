M. t.s Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nWe can't let this happen from Lisa ... is President Trump's words moments ago on the thousands of migrants heading from Central America to the U.S border with Mexico\nI'm not so happy with the entity giving them money I don't understand why a public utility\nIs giving out money for these kinds of things and I don't really it rubs me the wrong way and it doesn't stop with the west wing or five million dollar project there was at one point five million dollars annually\nOver the next ten years for naming rights of jak trace field and\nI wanted to talk to Joshua Mandel bomb he is a staff attorney at the environmental law and Policy Center obviously also one of our council members thank you Josh for coming in here I really appreciate it happy to be here and I didn't coach you on this but get a little closer that Mike so they can hear every where'd you say\nYou were also told me when you got in here that the the the Y pool also has their name on it\nIt it does it and this is actually something you know you see utilities all over the country doing things like this to to buy or build goodwill with the public\nSure ... we I looked it up really quickly and the myth American aquatic center\nAnd pray medicine been American both kinda chipped in I couldn't get the number breakdown right away ten million dollars\nSo I Will where's this you know where this I I actually reached out to the American and I said where's all this money coming from the get comment and I didn't get a response but where do you know where this money is coming from ... how do they have this much money\nWell it's a profitable business and a part of the business model is they use ...\nAll their profit right or to build goodwill and I think a big piece of what what this does is it they try and cover over maybe some of the things that the public would otherwise be unhappy with by building up their goodwill and giving to what are what are good projects for the community\nThat I consider this isn't correct in a legal sense at all but I'm about to say not even remotely correct\nBut I kind of consider man met American kind of like an arm of the government kind of it's ... you know because they don't have any competition we we have no choice but kind of have to use them that's not a legal definition any lawyer out there you are probably like well they're not an arm and the government you know\nThey're they're not but we ... them monopoly status\nRight correct so this ... there seems\nTo be this idea that this money who was designated these increases in rates were that was designated for ... sustainability efforts that may not actually be happening now is that what I'm hearing\nYet so there there are a number of pieces in this but Mitt American a pretty aggressively went after their energy efficiency programs up at the legislature right and those programs\nAre are designed to over the long run I mean that we need less energy and would pay met American less money they do right\nThey don't necessarily want to do those things but because we give them this monopoly status which typically require them to do things that are in the best interests of their customers sure\nSo some of these projects maybe look I Know that like ... they're they're the big debate is these these uh wind turbines like they're more expensive to build the costs so much more money to put up the money than the energy they say there's that whole the whole debate\nThat aside the\nWhole idea behind this has to save money in the long term to cut the money that the stuff we spend on energy in the long term that is why they raised our rates correct but that that's really that's why they say that\nThat's what the energy efficiency programs are for is to to save money in the long term and what you do is if energy efficiency works\nThe people who help implemented saving the short term Bryce their bills go down but because as as a whole we need less energy that means less billion dollar energy facilities in the long run\nRight but instead they're not doing this right that they went to the legislature to get that cut back and okay so they raise their rates\nThey charge us a lot of money or at least more money to get these sustainability efforts going and to help us out in the future save money in the future but it is this I mean is this let me ask the strictly this kind of beans which\nWell and I'm not sure you know the right piece that that you're talking about I mean I'm not sure on that and that right but I Do think this is is a bit of a a a bait and switch right there over the long run they're gonna get more more money out of there are\nCustomers because they've changed these policies and it's gonna\nHarm people over the long run so should\nPublic utilities like as you said this is happening nationally um so many Americans is not Standing Alone in this there are other um national energy providers that are essentially running goodwill campaigns and donating millions of dollars to football fields et cetera\nYeah it it happens regularly to the law as it exists they're not allowed to use any rate payer dollar's on any form of advertising ... uh\nBut they are allowed to use shareholder dollars so that's what they do they use a they use a chunk of their profits to build goodwill and and do things like this\nAnd that being said obviously if you raise\nThat could be wrong in this but if I raise rates on people doesn't that decrease my losses and therefore raised profits and therefore I have more to give to these\nProjects that the profits are also coming from the rate payers mhm right\nSo is this something that should be happening let me ask that is is in your opinion my I'll give you my opinion my opinions no my opinions is you don't put your name on all this stuff you're a public utility you become efficient as humanly possible any past savings back to\nThe people paying energy should they be doing this yeah\nThe thing that concerns me the most is they do this to build goodwill\nAnd they they invest in projects that the community likes but then they use that to cover for decisions and actions that\nPeople might otherwise really object to and and have concern for so they they're buying goodwill at the expense of bad policy and taking actions that that cause harm over the long run that's what's really disturbing\nTo me now are there are some things to you that are disturbing looking into the future or even most recent in the past what are some things that maybe don't sit and very well and you can use them as as an example where you can use other energy companies but what are some ways they're trying to build this goodwill what ... where's the sleight of hand what are we not supposed to see\nIt so it's a great example is the effort that they made up at the legislature ... I was had these longstanding bipartisan energy efficiency programs that have saved customers a ton of energy and a ton of money over the years but that means Mitt American selling them less less energy\nAnd it's a really good example as they were up at the legislature fighting to cut these programs and denying that they were uh that they were involved in\nA way where the seriously I it was a lot of interesting things okay the legislative proposal mirrored\nFiling that they made it the utility board it was a essentially lockstep with their plan and they said they had nothing to do with it [noise] I\nWish [laughter] or something [laughter] okay we're seeing approach a\nI'm a ... and they you know if they felt comfortable saying saying that\nThat's up to them right at the time they were being very aggressive and going after energy efficiency all of a sudden in the middle of the legislative session you see their name go up at\nAt the ... pool I and and so that to me is is a pretty good example of it you know it's a savvy move it helps them or by goodwill and take a take the focus off of their negative actions\nBut you know look looking at the looking at the looking at the whole thing generally though they're doing this with our money I mean they can say it comes from different budgets that's fine but it is without the increase in rates they would not be able to do this\n... their profits come from repair money [laughter] that's a good answer a so Josh what is it what are some of the things that you're you would like to see change in this area\nWell I'd like to see more more energy efficiency I'd like to see customers saving money on their bills and needing less energy over the long term but can write it saves money right ah I I'd like to see good accountability\nI you know I think everything that the utility does should be because we give them this monopoly power they need to have that checking that accountability right so we need to make sure that what they're doing is as economic as possible and if there are more economic things that they can be doing\nThen we should be we should be requiring them to do that you know one of the interesting things\nI I I watch utilities all over the country and just this week in Indiana utility\nI did an analysis that they were required to do and it turned out that they could actually save more money for their customers by retiring there coal plants because they were old inexpensive mhm\nAnd that to me or if you follow the economics yeah you do what makes the most sense and it's going to save your customers money and I'd like to see\nI'd like to just see that analysis be done I don't know how it'll come out I've got suspicions but\nIn today's market your whole needs a lot more than a yard sign in an open

would you be able to donate to these programs\n... still a decision right so whether you're one dollar profitable ten dollars profitable if the if there's an email with what you do with that dollar a
