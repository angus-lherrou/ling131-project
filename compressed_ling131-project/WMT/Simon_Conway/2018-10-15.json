I have to say using the evidence that they're using\nA it is hard to disagree\nYou've got Hillary Clinton saying they can't be civil to Republicans anymore you got Cory Booker who would be our president saying get in their faces you got a former attorney general of the United states Eric Holder said when they go low ... and we've got violence all over the country\nUm is that overstating it say they're mope\nWell I I think it's it's not overstating it to say that they they encourage behavior\nUh one antifa for example the left wing radical group trash is a campaign office and then announces publicly they're going to trash more officers are too which I think the answer has to be to arrest people like that\nAnd give them a long time to think about their behavior or I think you have to confront a real danger of mob rule and the concept as Lincoln said I'm the director to visit they will rule or they will ruin and I think that's really dangerous\nIt is really dangerous and actually we just saw it in Portland you you mentioned the uh the antifa are they took over\nAt an intersection it literally took it over a they were telling people they could only turn right I Believe it was and uh at one Seventy four year old man decided he wasn't going to take instructions from ... and when they all the way they chased him down the Seventy four year old man in his car\nOr they kicked his car they damaged his ... police were on motorbikes were actually watching all of it I don't get nothing and the maverick said yeah I I agree with the police ... that's ... rule\nThat is mob rule and it tells you on the left or the degree to which\nWe now have politicians who are willing to let their fellow citizens be intimidated or be hurt at times be shoved around me you be you know this is bizarre to me [noise] the liberals are the ones who are worried about bullying and that this whole cycle\nOf worrying about bullying now they are the bullies a radio and I think let's be honest about it they are so desperate\nTo impose their radical views and they see Trump\nLeading the country away from the radicalism that they desperately want and so every passing week they get more desperate and I think it is dangerous\nWell first of all as a historian I Love would we be was doing ... or he is trying to fill the gap created by modern education which refuses to teach American history\nAnd he has gone out at every level not just political history but with sports a free enterprise entrepreneurship artist really give you a flavor of what has made America remarkable\nAnd his radio programming is tremendous was you know he helped launch more in many years ago ... he's he's worked very closely with many of the most successful radio shows and so we're going to be talking tonight at the Iowa history center about history on answering questions\nAnd as a former historian who's written a bunch of books and a nine documentaries I really think bringing the story of America to the American people despite\nThe universities and the academics is one of the great exciting challenges and interestingly Reagan's farewell address\nYou talk specifically about his worry that we're not teaching American history anymore and that that was sort of his greatest regret that he had not solve the problem so I think this will be a very interesting evening\nI I Do too ah I've given you and in an invitation to come see is that the U.S is Iowa\nA while you that you do to go back to the Reagan Library I'm sure you've been many times as I've I but I have this new thing now where they

because the the mad Ted got ten ... yeah it was a Democrat\n\nHis come out now and he says he supports the decision by police to watch for distance without getting involved what would I watching from a distance there watching and the FAA takeover an intersection there is a calling video out of that\nIt is absolutely Marlboro they take over an entire intersection they make every one town right whether you want to sound right oh no\nThey ... people\nOn the one guy who decided he was going to you know I'm not going to do it it's ridiculous you have no authority this is America I have freedom in which way I Want to um\n[noise] they chased that guy down Seventy four year old man they broke her window when this call they kicked his car\nAnd\nI was appalled by what I saw in the video but don't support the well the police's bureaus decision not to interfere this whole incident will be investigated where do you support that decision not to interfere\n\nWell there's no doubt that appears to want to ask him that question\nHe wanted to insist that most of your question in Missouri should feel completely safe coming into downtown Portland oh why because cops just look don't well\nComplete idiots ...\nRuns the mall ... took over one of your intersections\nAnd made people go in a specific direction whether or not they wanted to and smash windows in a car and kick because all\nOf a Seventeen year old man who decided he wasn't going to buy the lawful orders of the mob people should feel completely safe coming into downtown Portland yeah\nDon't think so\n\nAnd that's why I really think uh we're in a different place I understand what the speaker was saying we have seen violence before we did see what happened with Vietnam we did tell our soldiers coming home and save lives in Amman coming our memories I got everybody go Scott are coming home\nThat when they were getting out they should take a uniforms off to avoid harassing isn't the same as a mall taking over an intersection is that the same as\nSomebody who is working as a press secretary being Harris in a a a at a restaurant watches that with a family is saying\nIs that the same as the United states senator being chased out at a restaurant by the way they won that round because as soon as the mob dissipated they went back and finish the male\nIs that the same as me and Congressman Steve king being highest on a patio in Washington DC well we have an all male\nIs not the same it's the last I agree\nBut once the generation the left gets violent when I go to the ... the way they're like you know two year olds having a tantrum\nI get that that this feels different this feels different\nDangerous\nI Want to talk about there's often the news so if you're on the phone please stick around and if you don't want a phone where you should probably get done and right now five one five to eight full ten forty to wait for ten forty we have United States\nSenators say in their faces\nYeah I don't

start with a Ronnie thank you for patients Renee you're on the sun to kill my show\nYes sir hey today today it's\nIntersections what about your ... your home the ... about to please step that are raped his wife daughter\nWell you know I mean we didn't get to a right by the way but we want to point that out but you know if the if the mob prevents the math from getting home is he going to want the police to step in what was he just won the ah the mall to prevent him from getting up\nI mean it's a perfectly valid question on a you know I I don't know the the answer to it but the the video that I saw with two two motorbike cops literally watching this happen\nWas appalling that video is freely available online by the way you can find it a just a a Google or go to YouTube I guess I look for a Portland antifa intersection you'll probably find it\nA runny thank you very much pressure to have a great the rest of the day off from Renee let's go to Craig Craig\nHi Simon I I think it's a in action and an activity by the leadership is putting good people in in a Pearl\nI I'm I'm I'm old enough to collect Social Security let's call it that way I'm In good shape and take care of myself I've also got a permit to carry and I do a lot of shooting\nAnd if some math guy a runs into me the intersection and tries to drag me out of the car\nI have an inclination prior to a lot of locked forty three and and myself I'm not sure that I should have to do that I obviously wouldn't be looking for problems but ah um I mean the bad guys usually the guy with a mask\n... you know wrong and are those people uh in Portland I'd masks someone I didn't but a lot of them that\nI can see this happening leadership in Polk County I can see it happening\nLeadership but ... but you see then you then you come up against me I mean this is probably a character flaw in me if I'm coming to an intersection and I want to turn left\nAnd there's a bunch of citizens wearing mosque dressed in black who will not cops who say you can only turn right and then stop cursing at me when I point out they have no authority to say that I'm Still get that son right or left I should say if I only want me to turn right I'm Still going to do it\nGoing to make that last time I might run over somebody's while I'm doing it it wouldn't be deliberate they shouldn't be in the road right now I I Know what happens once I've run out with a person's fault then what happens do they try and dragged me out of the ... do they then discovered that I'm Carrying\nThis someone have to die because they wanted me to turn right whether they had no authority to make me turn right\nOr again I think that's their plan is to try to make them look good wreck victims were were not\nI mean you see in Iowa now we have stand your ground would it be reasonable if I was dragged out of my own come by a mold that I was in fifth of my life where I point out cars that were damaged in Iowa now if I'm In the death of my life I can shoot\nWell I'll point out because I worked on it the stand your ground is only as good as the prosecuting attorney and they can still bring charges they can determine that you weren't you were at all it's not a it's not a panacea\nNo they can determine that I was not standing my ground but it was something else they can absolutely make that determination yeah but I'm telling you the only reason I Would ever draw a firearm on another human would be that I was in fear for my life when my family's life\nI agree I agree and I don't want to hurt anybody I Want to hurt anybody on the line guy\nHe's the only person that can say you're in fear for your life is you\nBut I think the video would probably back me up actually well I understand where you're coming from and I hope I never have to face an ounce steak or Craig thank you very much appreciate it oh let's go to Chris now Hi Chris you're on assignment commercial\nThey found when I was going good man how are you good good\nSo my thought is
