people watch local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believe that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard and it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign didn't that doesn't affect me I\nKnow who I'm going to vote for before I CNN and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can't avoid all those ads and a lot of people are not immersed than this stuff like I Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending\nOf a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nJust I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think\nAbout voting Democrat right now I I folks I really mean it I think given what we've seen since Trump was elected a Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever\nThis country needs to rise up and reject these people I Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe they're the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nIs in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule\nOf law I shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be the you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good you have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV as to tell you the economy's good then you have to believe it well I remember a\nTime when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well did you didn't need to be told you know it\nBut now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything\n[noise] and some don't cost believe this stuff [noise]\nYou'll you'll reject what you're living and believe what you're being told by people\n[noise]\nSo I just I Am I have yet to be influenced by a political ad now I realize I'm very ferment
