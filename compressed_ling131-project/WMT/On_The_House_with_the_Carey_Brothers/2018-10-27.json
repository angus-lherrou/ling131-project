Stanley sixteen touchdown passes on the season second in the Big Ten forty two in his career that's difficult time in program history one shy of Matt Sherman says yeah there are some lessons to be\nLearned I didn't really get off of the best\nLast year against some you know we had some\nYou know maybe we could have been heard it on a couple\nYou know done done some more for defense [noise]\nHave some sort of feel that they did\nHave a hunch if they do help the defense out today things may go pretty well for Iowa second in the Big Ten in rushing defense and in the country second in the country and second in the Big Ten in third in the country in total defensive those numbers come through the day the ... and you get there seven to win\nAnd uh take a big step forward and the pursuit if Wisconsin should happen to lose and there's some news on that today towards a trip to Indianapolis\nEither on Saturday October twenty seventh week number eight for Iowa will be number nine of college football season but we gate for Iowa with the by week\nAnd a happy valley a place that has been with where things have gone well for Iowa at times remember six to for a several years back I think that was all for you remember clay born walk into a kick\nOut there under the lights are but it's a place that things haven't gone so well for Iowa at times also Justice Roberts\nIs hell or I mean and I'll go back three minutes in ten seconds ago and you said Hi cotton I did have you been listening to Alabama and combine cab last couple of days or listen to do what you like gold Columbia [laughter]\n... role tied by the way they are just waking up by game three of the world series just ended ten minutes and it was just like it well maybe you stayed up later on in your hours off it's eleven thirty four in the morning not eleven thirty for an evening although it's kind of dark in here isn't and what is that what's up with that\nAt least it's not the window last week we're not worried about equipment ... blowing around running\nWell these are quite to the extent as it was a week ago we do get a you know think about the weather a little bit with the rain the coming down the old out their Iowa doesn't play much on grass a couple of different kinds of shoes ...\nDining room and just posted he said if you like pouring rain it's a beautiful day in happy valley posted a picture and it just looks miserable ... ah they'll\nThere'll be a hundred and eleven thousand cheering fans are although you know a help Iowa out it's a team that crowd a little bit maybe\nSlow down the Penn State passion game a little bit this isn't I have a team though that is um that is very balanced scoring forty points or more in the last two big giant road games Minnesota and Indiana first time in school history a that's happened in back to back Big Ten road games in the same season\nAnd Iowa was twelve and know since the start of the twenty Seventeen season when scoring twenty points or more contrast that or I guess compare that to the um total defensive effort leading the Big Ten fifty in the country and scoring defense and holding for opponents to a season low\nUm if those numbers continue to get today just in like the prospect\nTony man ... picture looking better and better by the way are we really what we need you know we have no control over it is Wisconsin to get another last\nWell since you mentioned that I mentioned that a little bit earlier um status update on Alex ...\nNot good not in the game he is out today so that's good for Iowa it's going to drive or Iowa I Hope it's okay for him I mean we don't want you know you certainly don't want wish him ill will but\nIt it could be an interesting match up with I mean he's either they're all the you know work horse depends on your ... he'll sometimes they'll probably get through the fields sometimes he just stands on the side and ... whatever\nYou know when they're playing Michigan why ah not much going on an airplane I all of a sudden he looks like a all American or headquarter with\nUm maybe a collapse perhaps the way to describe what happened to Iowa last week um as far as this balance that we're talking about both offensively and defensively and running in passing you have to recognize what may Stanley is done and hope that continues\nTo adequately I think uh you know that shows that we're seeing progress and you know\nWith the other ... [noise]\nHer office in the past protection him\nAnd he hasn't one of the things that uh that it's been nice\nIs she hasn't been on the ground very much a six Sachs is all this offensive line of has handled its been\nTraveling Lou and I were talking about this a little bit too it's been an interesting combination because usually people think about an offensive unit obviously one unit is five guys ... guys and you talk about\nMore experience they have the more cohesive ... together all everything except this offensive line he isn't now Ross Reynolds is kind of nailed down to one guard spot but the other one's still rotates\nThe tackles are young sophomores um alert Jackson and\nTry to address the big thing um and and any off in the wind because you know [noise]\nYou know there's the double teams and and I'm a law like that and [noise]\nYou want to know that you guys going to do his heart and you're going to hear ... letting us that's a big fan of the world for the hell\nYeah so they develop that trust with six guys didn't wind up or seven guys in the lineup and really\nCross esteem you see I'm having fun you see I'm joking with each other you heard trust and talk about how tight knit they've become Parker has the of course and others have talked about that on the defensive line just how good a friends they are how much enjoyment they take from being around each other a and whenever you have a team that develops like that we've seen what happened\nUh and happens when teens don't remember twenty twelve\nVery example as Kurt various rightly points out here it's got to do\n... do during the great job it's not a large senior class but they're doing a great job of providing leadership and we've got a lot of young guys are joining right in with them so off for them to get the younger guys on word is certainly a helpful I guess out of ... or a better practices better preparation and better deemed team discipline so\nThose are things that are going to have to continue if we're going to be successful this week certainly\nWhich a lot of credit on getting things turned around leadership comes from CJ ... twenty Fifteen undefeated team that this is a talented group or perhaps the most talented I was seen in quite a while looking for maybe a breaker too but you know make your own today on the road against Penn State a top twenty college football match up\nAnd uh hopefully if some things fall right particularly with Wisconsin wins and losses and you take care of business yourself there is a bright future ahead there's a lot for us to talk about ... over the course of the next forty five minutes or so\nAs we get ready for Iowa and Penn State we're gonna head up to a bigger stadium here Justin and the volume of around ... ... per\nMember that ban yeah only time\nThat is the first time they've been referenced on radio in seven years you're going to royalty out of that idea I just got to heaven sent just for the cup of coffee and drink and nine here are the old WMD copy ... checking with the geared up here in a matter of moments he'll set the scene we hope he's nice and dry where he is we'll find out no matter moments young bumper brigade", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On The House with the Carey Brothers", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "27"}
