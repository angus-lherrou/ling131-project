today um aren't like they used to if you've got five years out of the modern battery ... you've done very very well I'm with or if\nYou have a car that has all the electronics like these you know the navigation and the big screens and all this other and\nUm I Would tell you to go ahead and replace it OK okay if you know it's five years old you're you're going to have a problem with this this winter batteries have this deal now where\nYou can I've had so many customers that you'll start up a car\nStarted pine mhm drove the grocery store set it off\nNo more really oh batteries today they sorted out internally and they do it just you know I've I've seen it where Lou the Carl started up ... the guy drives down the road and he's like hey my you know the radio and the lights you know it's kind of flickers and do some things that we're stepping you shut off and his dad\nTold me really totally did uh-huh so um yeah if you've got five years out of the modern battery you did very very very very well and I would probably get look in the replacement before winter and I would definitely only by an interstate battery yeah and I and I'm and I'm not paid by interstate\nI'm used to be you could put not yeah check well even time I'm used to be you'd put water in battery you know like you check the ... you don't even have to worry about that anymore pretty do\nYou do you still should check the water on them yeah you should still check the water cause\nBut the only time he ever really have a problem if you see your battery and it's it's really moist on the top ... because it's been boiling over down that's when our our battery we'd need to double double check the water it but then we also need checker charging system uh yeah because if it's boiling over we might have another problem gotcha do you guys like\nAny more when you get a battery that they were just kind of trade then used to be if you like you bought a battery you by the old one you by the new one and then they you can leave the old when they're that give you a little\nCredit for it or yeah well if you don't leave it there is a core charge okay gotcha because we want to recycle yeah gotcha a\nPhone lines already lighten up we got a Elmer in ah we ... we do have one other thing I haven't got one of the thing\nYes Dorothy ... yes there's a lot of people out there that they're saying hey I Know Dorothy ... in today's ... his birthday Dorothy is\nVery very good friend of mine Marie\nI'm very good customer friend the castle motors yeah I'm very active in the in the Lutheran school in church out in ...

we don't need to sing do you want to do your your tax question you want to go to the phone lines are eyeing life let us go to Elmer ... known up there and Bill Clinton county Elmer welcome to the program high Elmer how are you at\nWhat we learning everybody I've got a real at high tech a question for you for my wife's a brand new two thousand venture van yeah and it's been raining lately so we've been taking it out on the road and a dog on a windshield wiper won't work\nAnd I've taken to enter the local Roger who'd they normally do a superb job yeah but they said they can find a single thing wrong with that show and this is the second time this has happened well\nFirst off losing the wrong terminology that use the word can't we don't use that word and in ... in castle language ... so when it when it doesn't work both of them don't work that just doesn't do anything let's\nJust just ... pop up in ah wipe the windshield off it just sits there okay it might start and then go halfway down three fourths of the way back into the\nA hood but it won't were on so\nSo it it may it may start a new trend on it might come up just a little bit and then it goes back down it\nIt will go back down and it just stopped right\nThere okay how do you get back down and you push it down\nWell it just stays there until uh shut the car off and then I might drop down and Michael back up all the way and then come back down again\nOkay I'm just a real concerning thing\nI'm I'm list say most likely it needs a windshield wiper motor\nAnd gee I mean of course you notice it more because it's raining um we had some problems with the the cow area on those okay we're that where the windshield and the hood meet together there is that's a vent area\nAnd there's there's dreams on there because the water runs down the windshield and like the old days you know the water ran across the hood now runs down in the ... area and then down through the through the body and exits where it's supposed to\nWe've had problems with the cow area plugging up with a trees tree leaves all kind of all kinds of junk\nAnd so we've I've actually had him on some some heavy rain times when the customers have come in right away we've come in and the the windshield wiper motor is actually swimming in water\nOK I'm probably by the time you get into the shop it has slowly seep back down so there's not water in there but I'm I'm venturing to say you have a windshield wiper motor problem but we need to make sure that that Powell area the vents the drains aren't cleaned out um\nThat that is not a problem because of ... in the garage all the time at a very seldom is out in any\nWay I Know I ... I still see it with just normal driving part\nSure so I Want to I Want to look at that but I'm I'm with what you're telling me I must say you got a windshield wiper motor problem\nOkay okay well that ah that would be the next thing will have the mechanics look at the next time we take it in sounds great thank you very much for your help\nDo you do you by chance do you use a browns up and cater\nNo use Bergdahl's here in Minnesota okay how far away from a paid or are you uh we're about uh twelve miles\nYou should go see my buddy Chris Henry and then go get going into ... afterward I've never been there and do what you're going to go to the ...\nAnd I know Brown's real well you\nGo up and talked to Chris Henry up there tell them that you talk to me on the radio and um he will take care of you very very well\nOkay well I Know one of my wood carving friends are buys their cars from down there and so\nPerfect or you can come down and see me but it's clear explosives [laughter] okay Chris will take care of it like I said go ahead and say hey I talked to Jake casts on radio and he told me come in here and if you're not nice to me I'm going to call them and tell them [laughter]\nWell if he doesn't offer me a cup of coffee then I really got her he [laughter] I was on knowing knowing Chris you personally go get it for you [laughter] oh well thank you very much here I'll thank\nYou awesome thank Elmer for the call let's go to a wells burned max and we'll say Hi to Jim this morning\nThe morning Jim how are you guys are like oh well thanks for calling in what we do for ya\nWell a guide or a weight there\nUm so I I don't have a problem that my my wife personally drives they fled vehicle she has for the last ten years\nOkay wow no issues but um you know the thing I'm going to tell you it's it's just like I teach in my driver's ed class the the number one thing before you buy a vehicle\nHabit inspected\nOkay um when you take it to your mechanic and have him look at it I guarantee you if if somebody's got a flood vehicle and they bring it to me and I check it over\nI'm going to be able to tell you it was a flood vehicle okay there's going to be telltale signs that you're technicians going to be able to tell you so I'm always have your vehicle inspected always ask the right questions\nUm and just just to go into it with your eyes open okay I'm don't don't be afraid to ask and\nDon't be afraid of that or any any legal land out there that has got to be noted on the title or anything like that well\nThat's the problem that run that we run into and it's it's been this way for ever and ever you know I've had situations where um\nSay you wrecked your vehicle okay now we're not talking about flood right now but we're talking about a salvage title which a flood solve a title whatever um say you wreck your vehicle you really liked your vehicle and you know they they they total it and and your buddy owns a body shop\nAnd he says gosh I can fix that thing for six thousand dollars well the the retail estimate was sixteen thousand dollars\nHe you buy it back from the insurance company\nNot all the time does the insurance company requires you require you to send the title to them so they can make it a salvage and then send it back more times than not they don't and that type of situation so at that point it should have been a salvage title and it was it um\nIf you had your neighbor fix it for six thousand dollars I guarantee you and I check it over you'll know I'm going to know that it the panels were cut ... panels weren't replaced by that panels were straightened which isn't a bad thing either as long as it's bop properly as long as it's represented properly\nSo um yeah it's it all goes back to having it checked out knowing what you're looking at um\nFrom from a dealer standpoint are from a if you buy from a dealer and it was misrepresented you know the dealership has to be me as a dealership I have to be licensed with the DOT\nI'm I'm bonded with the DOT um if I've done you wrong you can call the DOT and they're going to investigate Mm So so you do have versus going to a private individual by from private individual and trust me I don't care what dealership it is\nUm I Try to I think that I'm a a upstanding and do things by the book but I don't want the DOT coming into my place so\n[laughter] it's like having the IRS call yeah yeah they're yeah problem with any of those four and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if it's\nA ... a dealership that has for cars on her a lot or if it's McGrath if it's me we all have to answer to the DOT\nSo okay Jay well keep up a good work and I appreciate listening to your show get off the air and let somebody\nKnow problem thanks for calling in thank you last night we got to take

out of her quite a while and uh when I put the very back here and now I'm getting a siren that's going off and left rear deck of the you know the ...\nAnd I looked at my manual and I'm not seeing any kind of it's kind of anti theft radio deal in it but that's separate okay but I don't know what the speaker is it's going off and I put new battery in\nOr just like an alarm going off and I have you tried ... setting as far as locking unlock the door with the ... yes but the key in the door and unlock the door manually\nYes and I just went off nonstop really yeah\nSoon as like a battery up and then I just got married and you know goes off of course but and I can't find nothing in my manual that says anything about any kind of an alarm it so I'm kind of alarming\nSome sort of alarm on that um I don't know that that only because our wonderful German technology yeah um [noise] does it have the what year did you say it was two thousand two okay so it doesn't have a life or anything\nYou know when I'm looking at my manual the only thing that's got the anti you know somebody wants to steal the radio out you have to have to code you know\n... all that stuff that you put the code in and that\nI Know I haven't um 'cause I don't have the cold I bought the car used okay and so you know I but it but I had one time I had the battery out and my radio went off but then it did after drive in it for a day or so it just came back on salt\nI Would maybe try to get the code for that radio and see what you got there that'd be my step on that that's the only thing I think that's got a security system that would have never had never seen them have an audible alarm but\nYeah it's coming out in the left rear reopen the trunk up up in the trunk up you can you can you know you can just visually field vibration of the speaker and all that for that okay hum and it's it's not a regular radio speaker don't appear to be\nThat so I don't know I Will start up and run yes okay so now I just started so it's not a security system for the car then no I don't know well now\nAnd I'm kinda wondering if you know I I think what am I Do is just ah started up or you know get going towards going off and just start pulling every for use in the fuse boxes see when it goes off yeah and maybe\nMaybe we pull your radio fused versus where I'd start there done that I'll be on that too now Danelle both fuses\nMhm yep and fail goes so it makes you wonder if something's crossed somewhere something's got and that's where your car sat for quite a while it no battery could\nBe something with like a regular safety alarm one of the door latches well the way it possibly could now when you got it running it's not telling you you have a door or a jar still there's\nNo okay so that I'll take that out of it out into so\nNow it's kind of a weird I I didn't know what the speaker even those back\nThere and I would I Would be looking at my radio part of it then for the factories OK okay thank you for
