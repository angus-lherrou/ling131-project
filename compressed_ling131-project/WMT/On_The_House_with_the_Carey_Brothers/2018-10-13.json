items a bottle autograph by the coach and they get to enjoy the game on the field and in the stands compliments of nationwide nationwide encourages you to contact your local chapter of big brothers big sisters and become a mentor nationwide is on your side\nSpeaking of the head coach lets hear from Kirk he's brought you buy your eye out what my handwritten dealers\nAnd those include are friends with Haley equipment incorporated in Carol are incredibly today brings the halfway mark of the season for Iowa football\nIs it really goes quick and then the next step will go faster amazingly so you know the first game takes forever to to come around and then once you get into urging they've become pretty quickly but uh yeah the second half her surely goes faster\nDefensive line a defensive player of the week in the Big Ten Anthony and his three sex rally Marcia freshmen of the week to fix a\nDefense continues to to provide a special moments where\nI think both those words are probably represent a of a you know with Anthony the guys up front really good a good job we gave player of the game to the whole group and uh you know he had he had a tremendous gain there's no question about that but the the whole group that are really good job out\nThere and then um same thing with Raul you know we've got some young guys plan and a half for some of those guys that wasn't only their first road trip this year is their first road trip\nPeriod ah in college so uh you know he did a great job confusion out there which all Julie's did the same thing on the other side and we've got some young guys doing some good things for so that that really is important that's what's going to take for us to to have a successful here and certainly a [noise] you know when any of our victim games\nSo Kirk with ocean moody in Hankins healthier [noise]\nWhat's the makeup of your secondary this afternoon\nWe'll go ahead and start at the same goes started last week so uh you know Brent than him in a mosque you're going to get to start but to all for the guys will play\nAnd you know part part of it is a both those guys did a good job they've been doing a good job really since August a obviously a lot to learn\nA starting on August but you know really if you look at the four four guys combined uh there aren't a lot of starts are coming into the season so it's a young group we knew this starting out and uh the good news is maybe a and it wasn't necessarily by by choice\nA week and a half ago but maybe the good news is well the chance to develop some depth and come up with a group that to maybe ... can you know compete\nWell there are the edge [noise] well it's encouraging to see the front and the ... plants do well because you you should have a mixed master of activity going out of line backer money certainly is out for the first task or who do you go with the district\nYou know you need a scorecard to keep track of what's going on here this year at linebacker but uh for sure with the money out of who's playing well by the way but\nUm you know so he's objects going to be out I'm In the men's out so we'll start with parents tend to get on the outside position to the field uh in one day we'll go with the Welsh a Christian will be in inside there somebody's position and then I'm John ... who will position again and\nGetting the money back in the second half will help us if we had to dip into the freshman pool we've got the ... on\nA set Bentsen also you know ready to go and um\nYou know we'll just kind of play by here but I think um we mixed in some some um [noise] a substitute package last week would you know stone and moving them on the up and I think they'll this game was itself to that opportunity as well too so we'll we'll skip makes them things up and hopefully whoever's in her does a great job and that that's kind of been the the the more we\nWe all kinds of lines given up on the ... all year that that's the best in the west and the Big Ten and as an old old line guy that has to make you very proud given all the new faces and shifting that's gone on there\nThat are ... that came to my attention last week somebody brought it up and so you know as you might imagine like a no hitter in the nights and I just assume that talk about it uh but the good news is I think that you know we just talk about some of the guys on the fence and I think it's probably represent we're a little bit more veteran just overall offensively right now uh you know\nAlert that a nice job last year in a trust in worse than nice to tackle those guys were first year God's Plan and it showed at times uh they're they're not out of the woods yet but they're they're playing a lot better football now on a they've worked extremely hard and that whole group is not a good job really Keegan stealing God's really experienced in there so those guys have really worked\nHard and they're doing a good job and um I think that's kind of again you know you're talking about the two tackles you can look at our receivers the same thing those guys are first you guys last year including neck who was you know a an older guy that first year with us so I just think that experience is really starting to pay off for a little bit\nCoach to Indiana there's often a will remind you a lot of Minnesota's a fence except they have a much more mobile quarterback and paying Ramsey\nYeah that's a big difference so these guys will throw down the field and they had a house they'd be numerous times uh they're ... feet deep and other hit a couple of missed a couple that are the point is they'll they'll take their shot just like Minnesota will\nOn your point of the biggest differences the quarterback will pulled down in front of somebody or we don't keep contain ... he's not afraid to pull it and go get the first down and uh he also can start run around back there and keep his eyes on the field and search it that way so\nHe's he's been he's the catalyst I think of their other often to the football team and they're they're good offensive team\nI gotta tell back to measure a little bit of Jordan Howard he's not there yet but a pure freshmen who is number two in the country and cherries only to Jonathan Taylor this\nStevie Scottish put up some impressive numbers\nHe's really done a good job and I guess he was hurt last year he only played a couple of games but he's a big physical guy has got to bring down and uh you know they they've got a really well conceived off and he's a part of it certainly the quarter back to the next one player and then I'm impressed that the resumes I think you know they've spread it around a lot of guys with a lot of catch is\nNot surprising that Tom Allen a former defensive coordinator uh when he got here are under Kevin Wilson and they've been proved that defense from day one all over the map\nNow they have and then we missed that uh you got here and sixteen we played them in Fifteen months time out so it was a little little bit of a learning process for us going through things and then they graduated some guy so they have a little different look this year but on the bottom line is that they play with this person they're very energetic they play hard I'm In that that's been a little bit of a problem\nOr through the years here but I think you know they've done a really good job of making strides defensively\nYeah while Indiana's making strides defensively Ohio State put up six hundred and nine yards of offense last week a hundred and fifty five on the ground that's why I like the hawks get that running game going today just pounded stay where they consume clock good a recipe to have on the road\nA Michigan State with a thirty five point effort here at uh Bloomington a couple of weeks ago so while the Indiana defense is improving\nBut they've got a ways to go yet her parents has brought you each game we buy Mahindra did you know there's a ... for every one in every job come find

Ramsey on the recruiting process and he certainly has disappointed sixty seven percent completion percentage spread the ball around but what is it that we don't see about him that you love about this kid\nWhereas preparation you know you're just so consistent you know just as an an amazing job off the field the players believe in him and it is mental toughness and the weight room and his great and fight\nOr extremely hard worker I'm extremely physically tough kid I'm away from the football field as he prepares and are you all the things to do with our guys to get them developed he's writing at the ... you know and what you would expect from your leader and\nA guy that uh has really grown on this field is well this season so I'm really excited about um what he what he brings for us and and the way that he is destabilizing force regime\nWhat I like another element the troops are introduced this year as freshmen Stevie Scott you're losing a running back not only is he a terrific runner but he's a heck of a pass a receiver too and I know you're going to use it more in that area going forward but this has been quite a fine to this point out a shirt to show them what does it you liked about him or so about him\nBut there's no question he's been huge you know what I Love about him out of high school was versatility newly recruiting as the guy that\nThat when you're going to be a line backer or running back we really weren't sure he played boats in and thought he had a big came running back body and that's something we were looking for needed on this team and so a ... ... is that doesn't work out we're going to move the linebacker ... it was okay with that I just wanted to get on the field so\nBut I think it's heart was running back and that's where we started him and\nYou know obviously got opportunities early in the season with some with an injury in a situation that you're afraid that uh opening for him on our office and he never looked back so um he has trends patient and vision as a runner and as you said he catches the ball well\nOut of the bacteria which is something that we we like to do also so I'm very versatile guy can pass pro as well as always hard for young guys to take out but he's really developed into a find player\nCoach I Know you're an old defensive coordinator and you've worked hard to improve the Indiana defense or how has it gotten better this year\nWe're the ... continue to work on\nBut the biggest area that we're addressing our debt you know we just a year ago we play very well a lot of the time we'll get more down like\nGames late in the season I say to me got too many ... so they try to address that recruiting and then player development play more guys early in the season but really try to stick with that\nI'm a ... sensors improved um it has done a good job to stay in the past did not do the job we needed to get his Ohio State I'm just play a lot of young guys especially on defense so gotta G to grow in maturity ability to communicate\nAnd if they actually huge critical times when which can be a challenge when you're playing young guy so uh we just got to keep growing and and and building that sat in the book is if you gotta you know you want to have the chance when big games you've got that you're a decent\nWell they're all big on the big trend is you know coach or give us your snapshot your your thoughts on an Iowa here today\nYeah just really impressed you got to watch them throughout the entire season and all their games and\nAnd just do the balance a day they run the football extremely chowder quarterbacking Stanley just big arm has can make all the froze I Love the Chinese Man and just big physical then you get your receivers as well as they locked the great effort to get receiving the perimeter good enough to\nGet to take advantage of thing you should give it to them and and that big alters across the line you know and then I came away and the the guys you mentioned that I really love what they do on the side of the ball he's big and physical and fundamentally sound and run to the football\nAnd you know rank top five in the country and defense is is pretty special so that's got a big challenge for our team you know both sides and then there's there's solid on special teams and they can play last week in that area so I'm just a I I just see a very disciplined well
