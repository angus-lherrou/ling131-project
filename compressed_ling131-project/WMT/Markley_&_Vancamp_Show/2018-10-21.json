you know when our drought shut\nAnd all that your gross that's before you\nCount like and see and major repairs that come up better that's the gross cash flow the different ... around the payment so twelve\nThousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a\nRoof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yet you know ... yeah fire five ... five grand foreground something like that about a year from like that overall I Am a writer means from years will be better than others and that caught on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things are my Dutch um\nThe uh uh ... and what your household income\n[noise] um let's see we bring about a hundred and ten grows to tell you what do you own your home our primary uh we just\nPurchased it on ten months ago we owe to eighty and it's worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right [noise] yeah\n'cause my thought is on as soon as we're done we have about ten thousand dollars left and and and got\nThem in your ... said\nOh we have combined probably twelve thousand 'cause we took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of ... and drew it out of debt so they have any help now than ours like\nBaby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorter do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you guys are going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd rather check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I I was hesitant is because not because you're doing airplane and that no it's\nJust that the end of the year is always really tough and light failed you know in Iran\nSo it was just there in the event that um my condition that don't come through for the next three mine [noise] um I was afraid to liquidate it and let it I don't think an extreme on being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas if everything goes wild than I Would just write the check\nMhm okay not tripling focused uh uh\nThe uh uh you know ... ... you're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could flip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two I mean I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love ...\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it\nIs the most appealing to me the three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so uh my gripe won and dumped the other one the fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know making anything on that\nAnd that you're in a gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya\nMeaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks by the year ... money on that house if you go to three months vacancy if the market chop it up so\nYou just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one than you guys just got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility that's separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build your some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth menu making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that and that's that's the cycle you're trying to break some good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's what I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I've got a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay All right ed and they're all going in\nJust seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah well that you're you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong but more in there but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are\nI mean I bet people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going you know there's just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nAnd really quick I wanted to ask why should I invest in the financial peace university um I should I get\nThat now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first then\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to I don't want to just give it to you in that way and have to worry about it oh okay All right that that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well\nBut basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget a budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar of my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page them spend X on food and why on utilities and Z on rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any left over money in your budget\nIt is a great up I made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before and then this one is definitely the easiest as far as\nThe Harlem the problem is as you are facing your realities it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not\nForgetting all suffer pictures and then I got this one bounty on you know and we know what the food really caution we know what the utilities really are and got a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you're renting movies climate that's fixed thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusted for Sam you'll get it man on I'll have to like pick up we'll get your signed up for financial [noise]\nThanks to Dr Charles our producer get within our

working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams in plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills are being possible let alone saving\nFor education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting\nTerm life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different\nAnd responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and it put you on course for better things ahead\n\nI don't know the debt payment means no credit card bills no student loans no car payments what if you never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless or overwhelm from living paycheck to paycheck\nWhich are over one hundred thousand dollars ... and so I'm trying to find a way to help them in a room and [noise] I'm trying to get a little bit but I Know that I'm short on knowledge and experience so\nWhat's your what's the problem [laughter] well the pollen has made a\nKind of taking it on the dad is kind of taken on to be be collector in a situation that's how he's pressured his daughter and and with All right you should be um

working fulltime\nI don't know her and we agree that she always being video editing and she hasn't been able to keep a job you're out of between irresponsibility and it's bad decisions and our lifestyle\nOkay I I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat and mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay your bills or are they shocked\n\nYep yeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor to sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they're both on this\nAnd that can play collector all he wants but let me tell you something about collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq there was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know walking shearing work much\nRight now so she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on the student loan and if she has won two then what change do take like five jobs and getting gear but that's going to be a shock to her little system\nSo she didn't like the news to work and much\nYeah

says in the Bible you're a fool if your co signed for another\nAnd you may nicer than that but that's the message so uh you know ... I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it and want 'em start working on the top of it mostly where they mate\nDoes if she doesn't pay it they get to if they don't pay it she gets to\nThat is what ... only works are both on the stupid no show I treat them both like individual cases and let them start chewing on the top one I'm searching on

I I we ... we have paid off I home and feel nights ago and we're looking at whether or not we shaped by if they got how about that way I'll take it as it was actually and we we want it to you\nKnow what I mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt and once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that's kind of the you know what we're thinking about having you know we definitely that if you know actually I Am on the you\nKnow I mean you could benefit with Bob uh [laughter]\nBut beyond that to do it I mean you know it's it's when we want his ... definitely not a need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd that to twenty now ...\nOkay and you don't have any debt but your home or you don't have any doubt at all\nYeah we don't have any guy\nWith no payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nA point that you know it's not really ... him [laughter] years fifty\nGrand a year or two hundred and you want to buy a better house currently at the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\n\nHow about you want the house [laughter] but I guess now that in that the yeah there you go yeah but bad enough to going back\nSo this is a this was you know I I'm picking on your just to make you think okay well you know I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing what happened was sharing online Jody when we went broke was we should never again\nNever again they'll take phone call if somebody calls us collecting money it's a wrong number right okay and and life is God\nAnd there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into the news again or the bar or a slave to the land that's our decision that's how we decided to live that's what we teach people the goal is\nIt's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show rocket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and then you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms I couldn't do it it makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it\nBut if you do it you know you're just living a different thing so you called me to ask me my opinion\nWhat would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really like work hard to say about the money for it and I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go\nI like my lifestyle but I don't know like those two bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said\nAnd I show um which is okay that's okay choice you made the choice though\nBut what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money and it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on that one um show and just makes me sad that you would go back in ... I Would 'cause I I\nThink you got to stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have\nThe economy turned down to ... for back then if you did that feel when the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research\nI've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occurred on them home with a mortgage shall we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way\nBut the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times enjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had any debt just just ... I think I Would probably like ... it will be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off the way to go\nOkay how old is she sixty three why are you know power of attorney [noise]\nShe's starting to forget stuff um she kept getting checked out for demand shot ah she's in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying us that's like a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff what is your income\nUm she makes ... about twenty eight thousand a year\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in ... now and she's kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and I'm In an apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house yeah so what's the housework\nI'm guessing sixty five okay\nOkay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house ...\n[laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed ... how did she get on the deed [noise] um\nMy sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to lead so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage and I'm not anymore I\nWas it yeah I told my sister I well not anymore yeah everything everything's in my mom's name all the utilities everything as\nTake them out [noise] yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't trust utilities off 'cause we don't ... your ... and her name\n[noise] um she has said that she can't because her deposits\nToo high mhm 'cause she doesn't have to pay her bills so they [noise] they to the pause it to you know how can say for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right yes okay checks to pay the bill that\nAnd that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today\nYeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good\nAnd one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away yep okay so we don't worry about those quit paying all she did that we're paying a student that quit paying student loans\nSo now I got to eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills that does the rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia mess twenty eight thousand hours\nYears she's sixty three years old you live in an apartment we have to make sure she cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say there was a car in here does she need to be driving\nI say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollar car 'cause fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right just can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the problem she forgot how did you get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no right she I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt\nOr to hurt someone for God's sakes definitely along she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee from Wisconsin and we'd have one of those silver alert sure whatever they call them right\nYeah yeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\n\nAre very hard decisions for you right but you have to do your job as the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets your sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care\nIt's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself okay so that all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada okay\nTell your sister she gets nothing not a zip\nSell the car now I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what limit what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a person I knew it in for security okay\nI'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here there after taking care of mom okay I was in the high paid fifty on that last like on\nEach one yeah it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and\nYou know five hundred bucks settles a whole dead or something like that clears up\nThat's fine but here's the thing if they were to sue her do you know what they're going to get\nNothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attach an annuity\nAnd so that she's what we called judgment proof because she's broke and so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to\nMr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them and just go here situation she sixty three she's got dimensions she has no assets in her only income as pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that from Utah natural coach and he said they are judgment proof okay\nAnd uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way

as a grudge\nOr we can stay in the west not do the courage or we could say and not to upgrade I literally I mean and save money and\nMove with a ... right\nThere's no way I wouldn't go work in a I mean you've gone out and the first thing you do is go get house fever\nRight and I have to after hearing that ... that that stream that you just had on I thought I but I Know is they are already\nYeah I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you\nShed but All right I just I just couldn't go back once\nThis hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not\nA ... that's where I worried house as a matter of fact I'm\nWell above average square footage and you know stage in a great neighborhood by definition in the ... market that's what that houses so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you to do what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us back in ... nothing bad enough to go work a little bit and there's a lot of stuff I like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish the owner of the money to do but I'm not close to death for\nEven for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good without any pay much so you do what you want to do but um\nI Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it um I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments you save up some money to fix up the Algerian as you said there's some upgrades\nOr if you want to move cyber mental shape hard for a couple of years you probably should have a fifty grand two years without any payments or if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out imposing riding around on a Sunday afternoon solve this particular property well that one's not gonna be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do or am I going to be mad at you either way I just couldn't do it there's no way ... is with us and Canada are you all know how are you\nI think two days for taking my call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him a long distance landlord by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who is my penance by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place so it's currently sitting empty the entire complex that its and has gone down in value from my unit is worth Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm so therefore\nThe units of the same style inland as mine and mine was the lowest priced at ... like a thousand dollars good uh yesterday a similarly and it\nCame on the market five thousand less than me so one hundred Ninety five thousand I'm starting to feel a bit of urgency\nTo sell because it's sitting in the winter is coming you know I was thinking of dropping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out also paid six months worth of condo feet [laughter] doing all this with me and that I Would pay five to six thousand dollars\nOut of pocket um after the market is this\n[noise] but like I saw how would you how much we ... out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies around ... obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland I don't know\nWhat I'm going to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping overall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um\nI don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market I've got to be the lowest one on the market\nUm this is not looking good you know so um what I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't [noise] you know\nSo you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's so uh but the but five thousand out of pocket to be done with those two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah that'd be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worse and it kind of ... and when I have not a place to live in the wintertime how\nWell but I mean not only does this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worth three hundred thousand two years from now exactly\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's it's time to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now have you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket what thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nI put a tenet ... offspring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but\nBut overall yeah let's get rid of this thing
