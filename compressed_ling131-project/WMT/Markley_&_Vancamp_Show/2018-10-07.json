{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Okay and a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that for five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off our surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. in miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund as I write\nA crack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy those stocks\nThose ... ... ... if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to three to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick\nI might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency fun\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's only worth about a hundred and ...\nThat's not bad it's only ... only ... years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payments used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd a bank you know what else will happen is ... ... you remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nOr ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and\nYeah that's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\nYet no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play\nIt changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both that both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd use make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that\nTo say yes I Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten or that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months be debt free on this whatever it is six months or whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get I'm going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir\nSo honored to talk to you very very well done\nWayne is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWell thank you ... help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading lights on for about two years now and that we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans are working on and then we ended up getting\nA now I got pregnant with her first child and April so we take your advice and stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know all that good and a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her\nThree month maternity leave um pain free for us which is great and that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike at\nThat last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nWith a baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is what would you do it in that situation that we eat we eat\nPolice are maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA December the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that we usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball Kobe becomes pile up the casualties when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your debt\nCorrect as long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there's no issues and we're not it's not really for\nMaternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much cash will be got piled up or will you have piled up by decide what what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that she's wanting to take the three months off the bond with a baby on such and we can't do it on my income alone so um that's why we are smart about this and it said that\nGold and make sure that you know so we got from now until December to continue to save right\nCorrect and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much\nI'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month because what we have and Ben from other than our car payment I Know I mean do you have your back and all that balances you need to pay off and doing\nTime no not really went on your car and you know how much you owe on your car alley\nOn and on the dollars well then the four thousand would be your you're paying off out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to re month so you have the cash you should\nTake guys this is James child's producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country did find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash show [noise]\nMe tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nDreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen there will being would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting\nTerm life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\n\nRight another debt payment I mean to know credit card bills no student loans low car payments or if you've never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless are overwhelmed from living paycheck to paycheck\nDoubt as an adult under her name\nHas alligator exactly\nExactly okay tell me a white guy for contractors that was like a flaw or restaurant jobs like a money that actually passed over the payment Philly and I said okay without getting myself and can't help\nPayment literally get included and paying payments Oh nice okay right so the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now ... years later a ... at last ear see I got my job\nAnd she gave me the payments and I realize that even though I don't get started off\nIn the corporate world I don't make enough I have to pay for the car so my story kind of like a lady that called the NFL I Know how your guidelines that I have to get rid of the car and I don't know how to go about doing that I get my leg you know it's not our off so thick yeah and it also takes so\nShe mentally ill and they don't act like is she mentally unable to make it legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally ... she's mentally able she has a virus that if their credit so that's why he was able to get the car and get painted actually did\nShow here's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck\nRight because you ... ...\nMore it's not gonna hurt your credit at all your ... it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\n... boy it out I think Kelley Blue book steady was a work around a close to twenty thousand it sent me found out\nIt's worth close to twenty thousand would have voted against it\nI Want to throw like ... like twenty thousand now okay or does your ... to have any money she retired but not really so she couldn't afford it okay All right\nWell I'm sure you guys are in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because here's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the payments and when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\n\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\n\nYou're not legally are way I\nDon't think I mean I Know what I Do get accepted it I Know I'm at fault for not very\nYeah how old are you what do you make a choice they have their\nJeeze [noise]\nOkay well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars\nTo put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from your the she gets from her buyer to pay the car all show that the buyer can get the title and that's going to leave you and her is going to leave her\nSeven thousand dollars and the whole if you want to help with that you can um and we're I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid and I would ask you to split it\n... that she each thirty five hundred and thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction have her sign a power of attorney over to you for the this title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um I have her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this and her penalty for being engaged in this because the other option as you stop paying the payments and she gets ... D\nDoesn't sound really scared of the credit yeah that does\nThat doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the ...\nI got sick old lady's gonna get sued for trying to do something nice but she did it in a stupid way so I think you listen to the fairness thing it's not a legal thing\nBut it's what I call stupid to actually do something stupid and it costs me money like

AAA eight to five five two to five Jill is with us from Phoenix Hi Jill how are you\nBy day thanks for taking my call and when I Lived here for a while\n[laughter] I I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago she was living with a man\nWho had family his wife had died and he had three small boys [laughter] to to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is picking out a couple of title alone in her car a road rubber check as credit card debt to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be here with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of last year\nShe almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay our debt [noise]\nUm what does she said a nice collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nAnd now she's still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight here in Arizona gave myself and my husband the responsibility of taking care of the baby now and go wherever Sean ... baby stays with me\nOkay so ... now moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the mother\nCorrect okay good good that's good news okay good so here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd the she's dealing with bipolar and you know your state she is what we in the business called judgment proof Oh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any payments that's what it amounts to okay\nWhat I was thinking that he wasn't you know her boyfriend has said to me\nI didn't make Lee and find anything that she wasn't aware of makeup but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume that debt is valid for\nUs it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet well\nShe might even got a job right now I Know I Know yeah\nI Know what I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we worked with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes to church\nWith offer him in the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me they shouldn't get pregnant armies mad because she's on to ferment every day so she's been from the\nBottom line is random line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a\n... [laughter] yeah but it can happen it can I address\nOn what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her checking account because\nWhen I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\n... alive companies don't sell tree term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander ... last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll lose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself\nAnd so there is no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it Irish you're going to be under grant can't no matter what you know but I didn't know there are certain steps now that if I didn't take I Would lose out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever they're\nNo there's no difference at all all you do as you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign in or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value watched the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow walk or nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with them to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to ... get them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've been on a wake up and down probably seven months ago on ... on a really challenging time because we have a childhood in college that can you hear that we need to pay for and that's how I have to carry care expenses where he can get an extent that they can hide it and not ...\nI'm I'm going to try to figure out in the\n... before they can be called fair came to town on or taking out a scare while I'm afraid I kept trying to make sure that we're going to write the check I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work it was really trying to stay on them washed out just fine\nI'm Sorry you did the ... the century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\n\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got there so ... you're in the middle of the storm we got a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm not going to tone on it and I have to pay twenty three by coming out here I'd have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way there okay\nWell I mean even if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\nOkay\nYou have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition\nI'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband make about Seventy okay and what did you use to do\n'em in software support and how long have you been laid off on a down side to not wow ... ... worth\nYeah definitely I can\nI add on to something in that period of time in that field\nThat makes two of us working on it working on it okay\n'cause I I Know in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position\nThat ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not you're in an active market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nI'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester\nTime and get a job and pay is eight thousand\nOn that too but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life\nOut of your husband's income and that's what you push through\nBut I'm with but you know the site thousands another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money is an emergency I don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear are a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force have for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind than taking my call sure my and I are brand new stagnant in August I Can't find the northern California and in our man\nWe I had a guy on an accounting here as a para educator and got much at stake [noise] my husband did not\nAnd so our goal I paid cash and that they had said that [noise] and and\n... and that got anyway and standing right along with ... eternity we now have it for like hey why don't we get a line against it about four years ago and had eight thousand dollars you're meaning\nLike can you retire and say they are getting in the Senate making a payment and a half\nDollars and then I came here to finish paying off a ... dollar he retired from there well he left the compound all down and write accurate twenty eight years if if the wind and could lift they cannot during higher\nNow that doesn't matter on this you're you're a four O. one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nHave had to cut back on it and get written anger that he can continue to make payments\nAre satisfied and running around with I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the company is saying that's fine but I don't think that's so my I don't\nHave anybody that happened after that it's Conway combat faraway people\nYou know you need to Mandy call attacks professional that the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are taxed and penalize\nAnd that's my understanding of the route okay so what I read that under the impression\nThat right now and when Lee lab that we weren't going to be able to pay it back that's what we thought right based on what they call that we are going to take a penalty and the taxes on it wow and when we ain't got\nSettled and can they can get a letter saying that they face categorized and Eric hired I don't care because they don't get to decide what IRS tax regulations are and they don't get to make them off and\nSo what they're letter says doesn't matter you need to get some professional tax advice and go to Dave

thousand\nOh man well uh I had a little bit of everything I had a well diversified portfolio\nOr other loans uh ten credit cards a couple of cars everything everything wow\nHow old are you thirty four okay and I take it you're single since you're standing there by yourself yes when my girlfriend's out with your girlfriend aren't that works so what happened Eighteen months ago that the phone rings and dairy Derek answers the phone and God says wake up\nWhat happened well I saved up a little bit of money and I've paid off well paid on like ten credit cards and I thought I was doing a good thing and then the next month came around and I noticed that all of the ... the minimum payments were like ten dollars stupid and it was the previous month and I said this isn't the way to go\nSo from there I just started the search around on ways to pay off then and I actually saw this baby steps and then when I saw it I said\nI don't have time for baby steps I Need to get out of there tomorrow so I just kept looking around and then I saw um\nThe debt snowball and then click on a dare snowball and and you were talking about the baby steps again so I said I Can't get away from this guy so I'm just watch it and then started listening to it and I actually went to one of your small conferences in Raleigh oh yeah they're from there I was I've been on fire ever since then\nCool well done well done\nThere are other field I have no payments Eighteen months later\nHi this is real it's real but a man who was well worth it was well worth\nShow tell people when they ask well what do you tell people when they ask how you got out of that one of the keys to getting out of\nThat a lot of hard work hours every weekend for about a year and a half hour or so from there and then to get my income up also started\nTo sell things I heard that you're always talked about selling so many things that kids need their next I don't have any children themselves [laughter] I just started to sell everybody else and stuff so I Would go to yard sales and I would buy cheaper and then sell it for higher and I really have yeah I just kept doing that every weekend just be a man come up and pay more than just to get it done\nSo where did you resell it ... I was on Amazon\nOkay jump on Amazon with used item and works like anybody and it goes out of there so what was the item that you did the best with reselling\nI was actually a board game um things called master piece of sunlight I think I bought it for two dollars and ended up selling it for like a hundred and fifty woe is brand new sauce I liked is [laughter] with this alright alright\nYeah I Want to do that again as long as I absolutely well good for you man very very well done what was the hardest part of getting out of\nDebt for you the hardest part um ...\nIt wasn't necessarily to process it was more about seeing how that affected the people around me so you know that just affects society in general and I just made me want to get out of the fast and then going to tell other people that you can get out of that and that you don't need to live that way so that was really the hardest part was just\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it is a better plan\nIt was a good words those words tell me you'll never go back now now that this is the good life and I was ... my friend Rob this will be safe and we see him every morning we worked together and he's that free too\nAnd uh we just talk about your life is right now yeah Mm I meant well done show you brought your girlfriend whether you what's her name is Lauren and that's my mother deem All right\nSo you got the gang with you hear absolutely as gentle cheerleading ... we know you had to good cheerleaders drive anybody making fun of you are detractors along the way\nNo no not any detractors I mean I was at work so much ... there were no excuse me they would only people that saw him [laughter] I'll do the work of sleep and that was really I mean I just kept working and you know once you see going people can say what they want to say but at the end of the day and works and yeah you know I'm ... now\nRight okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty in two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I Would want to go\nOkay I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no pain in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay because when you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty to age sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll go ahead\nAnd do what you ... if we did you think it'd be it might be a good idea to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without our house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment you and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great aid you sound like they like create your vice\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars and twelve month good for you and yes and I'm Down to just one dead\nWhich is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been ... collections and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these debts have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband in a ... with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now ball and just continuing the minimum payments or\nEven not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems with it one is you're actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's going to come back home just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just to mark what a bad mark because this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill because they didn't offer you pretty much at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at this point in going what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a\nYou know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing okay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's\nCurrently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again and on top of that you owe the bell so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n... thank you for taking my phone call sure what I'm I have I have a question and I am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for not actually out there anyway [noise]\nUh and I want to know what would be something like the best option is [noise] I went I took a annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit mhm [noise] and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options uh [noise]\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd ready monthly income that should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [noise] I neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care on policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certainly what should be lower premiums than on your own life and then it went raised to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um and uh so uh [laughter] the anytime you start weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask but I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are\nWhen that's on the insurance world we call those bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that ... and you have a good ... you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling in income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value or down in value either one no no insurance on backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at the track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home as Seventy years old\nSomething like a growth in income fonder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm us Seventy 'em and they wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smarter faster as Dave Ramsey dot com put in your info and drop it on a list of the smart Mr frozen in your area\nYou sit down and then

renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with the loss of cash and your debt free everything about that and your homes paid for everything else just buy it for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from wealth but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week I'm\nHere's the thing about resort rentals\nVacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it\nBut you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to after you pay all the fees for the maid service and the\nYou know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it the manager and that covers you know made service and that kind of stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season with a ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment prop\nPretty it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your boy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there's a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know\nAnd you know it's just it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kinda stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broke anything but stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nAnd we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out\nAnd um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville in one of the ball game over there and the he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repair them and you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you", "show_name": "Markley &
