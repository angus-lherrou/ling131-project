Seventy thousand most of the student loans\nSo Seventy plus about fifty yeah about fifty four actually okay All right um\nWell the rule of thumb I use is is you don't want to own vehicles that are more than half your annual income and if you discover through going through financial piece and you make the phone call like you're making is can we be debt free but the house in two years if we keep the cars and your answer is no\n... I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where did you get your values are those private sale values are wholesaler a dealer offer what\nAre those are trading values okay so you could sell them for more than that possibly yes\nHow's your credit oh no you definitely could encourage you sell it for more than ... ... value I mean you saw it for a price I own my own on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nI heard your oh this money to these these two Carlin's where the loans um I Believe they are both true Ford Motor credit for\nIt so you've not got any easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all in her name then\nYes uh-huh okay [noise]\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is gonna be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty ... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the er the deal and the Eighteenth probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows ... and the whole if those were trading values\nUm managed to raise your only about six and the whole here um that's yeah that's not the end of the world um\nI I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had of value of a hundred ten thousand dollars\nOkay\nAnd when you're in the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd by our by you try to sell it for me I'm going to gas and say let's say for instance that would bring twenty twenty four that put three in your pocket unless spot three thousand dollar car with\nThat OK okay\nAnd um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrowed the difference\nFrom the credit union in your wife's name\nWas her credit ... and I get your three thousand or a car and I hope the but she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans but you're making one twenty six so you can do that and\nWithin a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up and car once we're out of debt and have your emergency fund in place\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years of time\nOkay and that gets you clear but you know your car poor you have a car mess on your hands are right to observe that and um\nYou know at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trading\nWell the dealer though you're going to make a little hot lasts on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run ... Carmichael profit they don't they're not in the break even business there and the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion\nEasy if not more the difference in trade in value improv a sale on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here in the whole program with them by it currently Iran I've got to buy I brought that up to you and then the total moneymaker\nFinancial piece book and the total panic over book okay\nAnd I am Seventy thousand dollars in that mhm and I and cutting and cutting the thousand dollar ... and I felt\nI work in like crazy I have heard right now working Seventy hours a week I'm a ... thirty at night where they are yet I'm right now our bills are kind of at a minimum pay but I Do not have a thousand dollar phased out\nMy main question it it it's um I had like Bill for mark and I should have about eight hundred three eight hour racked over that because he's like any money or anything like that it back and forth\nBut how much I point out in dollars and a lot or a category [laughter]\nI Know now it's time to read the books that you bought\nThe book the book the total money make over will explain to you exactly how to take your baby steps\nAnd I'm the first thing we're going to get current with everyone and get on a written budget you don't have a detailed budget yet you've just got a little little list that you made but you don't even got car gash on your list yet so you don't have an actual budget yet you need to do that on an easy way to do that is to\nGo to every dollar dot com and download the app for your iPhone or your eye pad or I'm Sorry your iPhone or Android or you can put it on your desktop and it's free to use every dollar\nAnd every dollar will help you put together your budget in about ten minutes so the first thing is to get a detailed written budget that you do a new one every single month\nThe second thing you've got to do as a part of doing that budget you have to have your husband involved you have to be in agreement if you're not an agreement and both of you pulling this wagging together you're going to get really tired of pulling the wagon by yourself\nYou have to have unity you have to have agreement in order to win money it's almost impossible to do it with one spouse by themselves\nSo a budget that your spouse and you both have looked at and you both agree to on every dollar dot com now when you've got that and your current with your bills the first goal\nIs to save a thousand dollars ... just save a thousand dollars for all the money you can squeeze out of your budget into that baby step on until you get a thousand dollars then maybe step to you'll read all of this when you read the total money make over\nIs you start looking you're ... and you attack them in that order and that poses hours a day Ramsey showing the books\nWill be back when you're in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's ... daily which are ...\nWe have\nIf a Jack of all trades would come in handy in the field to yourself fever and check out the ... three cylinder utility tractor from John Deere ... from ... to loading and hauling the ... forty five Seventy five or six hour along with them prove visibility to comfortable\nLead in a five year ... utility treasuries are liberal John Deere dealer today on my ... today and one of the most diner Islam in northeast Iowa location for you to go on line and we'll be IMDB dot\nCom it's time to make decisions about Medicare but where can you find information you trust and well well Mart Blue Cross Blue Shield it's holding free Medicare seminars and I will return powering and coral\nNovember ... into the water from ... in Iowa City November's election more details go to Walmart dot coms lashed seminars and you'll get a ten dollar gift card and just pretending\nSolicitation of insurance must reside in the same as ...

hundred WMD\nI'll go fast enough to fall down way register online and only ...\n\n\nSure what's up\nSo me and my brothers are taken care of mom dad passed on years ago she Seventy eight and intermittent or hell has sixty thousand dollars and what we would\nCall her retirement fund and then about six thousand at a checking account and that retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay off a little house and he's basically been given her all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that's a kind of a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not it's focused though it go it often goes without a tenant\nMumbling steady money coming in\nAnd wondering you know if you have a recommendation on may be a better um consider an investment maybe a admitted in pain or just a mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial situation is our net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets a Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with male so that three hundred two to three hundred a month if we've been chipping away at or checking account\nOver the past few years now five pound only six thousand ... that's about to start hitting the sixty\nOkay so the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah her about the past eight years okay\nI Know you've got that trash and that's invested in want\nAnd my brothers one of my brothers rental property\nOh mom's money it's not in ...\nHe could liquidate and he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route on but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made and this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well\nCorrect okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and\nIt's near my brother it's in his home town but it's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think ...\nBe better off to sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five she think that\nMore now for a favor no I\nDon't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks on the grill and I wouldn't get into that um I Would pick out I'd take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just drained the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation and to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month then\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund adviser do you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they've been\nPutting needle where I was a financial advisor then your company is a you're talking about your fried one K. and stuff okay All right yeah\nNot just grab one of the smart rest or prose off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom shut down to even if she's just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income doesn't have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month made a does half that you're still okay so what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um her checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained are checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah than let's catch it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds from let's walk through a child would do it\nYou're willing to give us the money for a nontraditional long because we were first time homebuyers on an unfinished house and I did find a bank that was willing to I'm going to be finished it within five years and ah but ... with appraised at two eighty um recently\nSo are they foster kids are adopted kids they're adopted now they were ... dollar and completion ... yeah what could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to fix the for it and you and you are what on it [noise]\nOne Seventy that's pretty tempting you know go rent something in clean this mess up\nMy my only concern with that is because I mean I've seen many a night thinking about that is our kids that we had we had five kids total we have two biological and tree adopted\nOur three adopt a kid all have to be reactive attachment just some very serious mental stuff that they're working in fighting through and I just I'm afraid that a move and a shift up in their life again is this going to\nI'm afraid that your parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to current cleanup hundred and forty eight thousand dollars or the stupid that's going to cause these kids' problems\nAnd that's kinda where yeah\nI work a lot yeah I bet and you don't have a life\nAs this crap owns you something's going to give you need to decide what's going to give or it's going to give without you deciding it's going to blow up on your dude yeah so you didn't make the call I think you need to sell your house\nAnd I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change ... easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household\nAnd you never be in there yeah\nI'm no I'm no kid expert just raised three but ... and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and\nI get all of that on a I'm not trying to be on feeling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case I think you guys don't want to sell the house because part of killing the dream of the rehab but the house too emotionally\nAnd so I'm On blame that on you and your wife I I I'm gone man I I'm\nJust how you're you're working on a house you're trying to run a business you've got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you need to get a few things off your plate\nI mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work on and you didn't have any that\nWe got rid of two of your three huge stressors here and I think you're on the quality of life will go way up\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid house there's houses on every corner yeah you get you in the house state [noise]\nBut you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your shoes they just decide which one you know and so\nThat's one thing you can do is I think the news you saw her car or sell bunch of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options\nSo I I'm I I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on them and trying to help them turn their life around and in the middle of that that you you're just you're good people man\nYou're my kind of folk I like yeah I Wish I could just wave a wand and make this go away but if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids and the quality of life my family can him over the next five years and if I don't have this debt\nAnd I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of the day that all of the sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was this house mess um\nOh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what the what hours I Am home I actually spent time with these children that are swinging a hammer when I'm at home um I just think there's you you just put you put your Superman Cape a brother you're trying to Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all\nAnd I think they're showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think you ... people in the ... do the right thing and you love your family will but um if I'm you I'm selling that houses just a stupid house you can get you know you get out of debt you get your business buildup you bring up a big pile of cash you can buy you another house and two or three years\nAnd and you know settling there and you're ... the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab while I have three kids with P. T. S. D. in my house these things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing I feel stressed out just talking to you about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what this shows about what I Would do so you can do whatever you want your grownups but um I I\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer who you're not you are going to pay mom and dad because you're going to do that out of guilt and your company the Irish or they're going to come take stuff um you put the student loans on hardship for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nAnd it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in financial ... and if I can help you farther you call me back anytime Lewis was in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nGood how are you did better than I deserve what's up\nUh I'm trying to advise my mom she she

you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this year for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not PBS Nazis robocalls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate these rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McCabe he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so you you said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial dial more people because it's a machine doing that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls robots ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and it becomes a yes or popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use

political candidates often a\nCommon space with other people of his supporters so not entirely on like that in terms of\nIt being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ...

Sunday we want to visit mount Carmel and a contest between the guts of bill and your outweigh the lord our God\nLet's pray heavenly father as we worship together today and look into this Old Testament story of your revealed power strengthen our faith and renew our commitment to you in Jesus' name oh man\n[noise] oh\n\nOh\nNo no\n\nIn\n\n\n\nUm\n\n\n\n\nOr\n\nNa\n[noise]\nYeah\nOh\n\nToday's scriptures recorded and first kings Eighteen beginning with\n... your largest city\nSending gathered to me all Israel mount Carmel together was four hundred and fifty profit to bail four hundred prophets of astro who eat and just built table so way up central message among all the sons of Israel and brought the profits together at Mount Carmel\nThe logic came near to all the people and said how long were you hesitate between two opinions if the lord has gone follow him but if they all follow him but the people did not answer him a word\nThen Elijah center the people I Alone and left a prophet of the lord but bill profits or four hundred and fifty men\nNow let them give us two oxen let them choose one Oxford themselves and cut it up and put it on the wood and put no fire under it and I will compare the other option lay it on the wood and I will not put fire under it then you call them the name of your God and I'll call them the name of the lord and the God who answers by fire he is God\nThan older people said that is a good idea\n... percent of the profits of bail choose one ox for yourselves and prepare first for you or many and calling the name of the lord God but put no fire under it then they took the ... which was given them then they prepare to call them the name of bill from morning until new sing obey all answer is but there was no voice and no one answered\nThat may lead dancing about the altar which they had made\nIt came about noon the larger mocked him and said call out with a loud voice where he is a God either is occupied or go on a side where he's on a journey or perhaps he's asleep and needs to be awake and\nSo the crowd with a loud voice and cut themselves according to the custom was swords and lapses until the blood gushed out on them\nWhen men day was passed they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice but there was no boys no unanswered and no one paid attention then you I just said to all the people come near me so all the people came to him he'd repaired the altar of the lord which had been torn down\nYour logic to twelve stones according to the number of the twelve tribes of the sons of Jacob tuned the word of the lord had come saying Israel show me your name\nSo the stones he used to build an alter the name of the lord and they made a trench around the altered large enough to go to measures of seat then he arranged the water we cut the ...\nThat's in pieces in the late and on the wall and he said fill for pictures with water and pour it on the burns offering than on the would\nDo it a second time they did it a second time doing the third time they did a third time\nThe water flowed around the altar and he also filled the trench with water\nAt the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice their lives and the profit came near\nOverlords the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel today let it be known that you are gone in Israel and I am your servant I've done all these things into your word answer me oh lord answer me that people may know that you or lord our God and did you have turned their heart back again\nThen the fire of the lord fell and consume the burns offering and the world and the stones in the dust and lift up the water that was in the trench and all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is God the lord she is God\nA message this week takes a trip to mount Carmel in Israel and the contest of\nGod's between bales of the king nights and Yahoo I have a God of the Israelites and the profit ... it's the type of story that leaves us asking what is it that we really believe\nWhere do we drive our security and purpose the motivation in life where is the pure object of our affection focused\nI might also asked as we begin do you have any idols\nThere was a doctor geology teaching world religion at a university who made a mission trip to India while he was there he mentioned befriended the local fellow who was a Buddhist\nThis man was very friendly and took to the doctor around showing them the sights and helping them become acquainted one day he took the doctor to a Buddhist temple\nWhen the doctor walked in he was amazed at all the strange peculiar statues lining the walls of the temple each one representing a different God\nThen he felt a little poking his side and his newfound friend gesture toward one of the statue saying see that one you recognize that one don't you that's your God and the doctor theology looked up to see a statue of Jesus on the cross\nAs if Jesus we're just one God among all the\nGods in that\nMan's mind though well intended he believed that you could be Buddhist and Christian you could worship whatever job you wanted or as many as you wanted\nWe have heard
