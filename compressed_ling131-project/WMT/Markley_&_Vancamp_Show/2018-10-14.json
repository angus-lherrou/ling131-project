I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or at least one or two jobs over the summer work four to six hours really teaching them the gear could get off with credit cards\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor\nYou for what subject do you teach\nTheology and specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting off the couch and exercise are being physically active now more towards the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand\nA hand in glove with some there are people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nA in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research in your expertise and your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stuff\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the Ramsey show\nNegative I did I\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a fee you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut I I I drive in the day or whatever I\nLive in the car payments because I told my buddy as you also there struck me told me about a sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk anyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a truck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home\nUm and my uncle is willing to uh your labor for me for free\nOr to get it fixed up putting you engineer for the ... and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck a problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it's probably not going to be reliable as a moderate are what the law which would you consider going down the road and you know dumping a couple of thousand into the truck and make it you know\nWhat you know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a vehicle layer off\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that ... going to be hated to I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up\nSixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty vet the to rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to ... dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast or not but but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car with what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do with the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I've got a question regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off offered to about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um [noise]\nI work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we\nAre required basically it's you you know for some of those business expenses and during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see have for that what we have to kind of that money had the time um\nWe'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we have money you know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover an anchor the hotel or guy who was\nAnd then you're you're going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're ... we came that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... the ... thing that you need to see that one time you need to pump prime the pump one time with two thousand dollars in a separate new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing\nReimburse ... business travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not\nPay you back ... ... is a little company you're taking a big risk sure you're\nYou're the bank or for the small company that's too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary\nAt some point they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's\nThe risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write right here company that was brought up they're going to take that money from that other company and pay the bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I bet it is Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would never do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips and why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollars right\nI don't ask my people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for their rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and\nAsked them to pay for me to pay back we just pay for and we give them a debit card we give them a cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit card\nWith ads gonna make your ... going to make your stomach because now you're realizing there's real\nRisk there is this\nIs Dave Ramsey shot

part of this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI could really meaning to it [laughter] any to hear what's going to be three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up character and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television shut down the kitchen table tonight look at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty dollars a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people\nAnd poor at all on those rental for two years is this rental worst that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or\nGoing to know horn and we want to sell it but I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more signed up for rental ... if the best way to do do it is to live to free the\nNationally live debt free yeah stop it yeah you got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide because I think\nThey were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrow money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nThat's what it sounds like but now you're going to clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by to brag about rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with

point one million okay and how long did this take\nEight months [laughter] okay and that is a story and your range of income is about eight hundred grand okay [laughter] my goodness gracious [noise] All right so what in the whole world this was a bizarre bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us plus for us that we had a decent income to I'll do for a live with all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd Tiffany I stay home and these two little lady awesome ... okay and so um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I I listen to your show probably for about\nEight months leading up to this and you know for me is pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's that's for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we sold a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but we made it through and knocked it out and so excited\nGoodness gracious [noise] so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nKnow obviously slaying it weld on so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake house bring the beach\nBring so the the ah the net all still lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nOkay but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off of the mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing about the four Seventy in order to reduce the yeah the other ... the\nCell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we showed about a hundred and twenty less than that\nOkay and that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off for assure okay Joe ... show the ... a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this year I was done was to say all of these two properties oh yeah oh yeah\nWow yeah one of all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge whenever you eat or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and how and mark caught me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one to four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and he did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity is all a lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nHe wasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Iran's eight or ... from the beginning so I mean I'm\n... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force\nRainy one would you like when I heard it was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nGood at going back to the fact that it's premium off but it doesn't cost me anything and I have to pay you know I'm Sorry it has a cash value in it right three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums are right\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nExactly I\nWas also they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nBut there again I ended up getting\nYou know it's funny is my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which I like the candidate you know policy that rates are low\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens to those results in dollars they're going to keep it now they\nGot to keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either\nMatch on the line and Los Angeles Hey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous ... thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nSo um my continent revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include the property taxes all modern association and the insurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away\nThe property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house\nPoor okay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago an even numbered life we ... we actually get a thirty year long but\nAt the council twenty percent of our income so um we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinanced your hair long one\nHouse if you've got to go to ... you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a\nYou know six thousand dollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know Hitler\nThe whole the whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the er and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be\nHouse for that's all it is this kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in Jackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGuys had her you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off really clay I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand or that's including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save and buy and so at least have for the down or if it would be more ideal pet save\nDiscontinued can take ... say they want a free country every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up and how you\nAdd on to this house I live in a gray area\nYeah I work from home is why I physically neither based\nIn what I what I have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about seven eight thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI wouldn't want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an extra brown jak kids I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over several for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my my part is a\nModel and as somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it just Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYeah and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and ... and how much of that as mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAh there is only three hours on end and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead furry and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't think of myself by and I know that we plan on eliminating the access

years until you get your other debts paid off now much all the data you got\nOh my God fifty four thousand left on their own okay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and when you show your house oh how much where you're much equity we get out of your house\nMaybe Fifteen thousand out very much at all\nOh gosh ... babies up to a little bit he re read the payments not too hot that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is I'm Alone\n[noise] um let's Hershey right refinanced about um two years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so ... so it's reasonable to assume you could get a mortgage that was a version more rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on ... three but it's going to be a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more\nTo live there right [noise] well I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions but this was not a bad thing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it\nAnd so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you want to move\nAs you say no no she needs to just sell the house right\nCorrect yes and so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nYou don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract we obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment\nThey won a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere um there is a brother in and give them a body going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this like what are given to you\nKnow you sure as far as I understand it now there\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pollen talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\nOkay lease it for the payment with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just show it then and that's no different to her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's\nIf this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe\nI'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay personal finances personal\nAnd that doesn't mean it's situational e ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item you know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen at the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not so in that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway I bought a three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I bought the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference and that didn't both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to factor in you know that there's something real uh uh about the connectivity to the item and its reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance for that at all so being personally\nThat's why people don't get out of that we don't get mad enough and you got to get ... get mad so personal and it's like I'm sick and tired of being sort of Darwin make so

two of us so a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and\nJust both of us spend money like crazy and and\nWere paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were\nI left the house to to our youngest child and ... and just ...\nA friend of mine invited me um to see you you were doing a total makeover event and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him I said sure I'll go see you\nAnd and I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or email policy of men are free and yes uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just stuffed them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nUm it just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized OK I'm the problem and and\nThen I had to do something to to get all that out take the ... I went home and I begged him to give it a shot and I bought your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey\nThan yeah would would retook the Thirteen week a few class at our church we started back to church or else along separation from him being regular tenders and went through a marriage recovery program and we just go to a really awesome church church has a\nSteady church to ... what city church ... yeah no it was it was God just working in our lives in front of the moment you know forever but really from the ... we started this plan it just everything started\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage that hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside that wasn't nailed down in our house and I mean when\nThe show which flipped with you too it flew up doesn't it yeah [laughter] you went from a whole host spending stupid all the way over to wide open smart\nYeah yeah wow that's so true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... classes and then we just got together and nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese everything\n[laughter] going into that we're going out to dinner tonight at a\nFairly extravagance is good and we're stressed out good no I just ... days but we've we've stayed plugged\nInto it and just never never given up I mean we we had the opportunity to leave your classes at our church and we now leader to two separate campuses and we worked with just dozens of families in Homer\nWe're supposed to hold on our home this very day by that he didn't want and then next Thursday when this why well apparently are real tricky not stress to the buyers how\nHe needed to put in the residential applications\nTo assure the kid mom and buying a house for him does not have a job so he probably on the verge of being disqualified combine this home and were freaking out because we took on Monday at sixty day blown out of my husband's IRA because it's kind of\nWanted to do that [laughter]\nWell yeah that's exactly what they said to myself all night 'cause we we just thought was just it was just going to be temporary transaction oh I put it back in right away and no penalty\nCredentials on your do you\nKnow would still be on Thursday\nAnd what happens if you don't close on Thursday\nI what we're being told us we have the option to put a three percent down and to recast as soon as we sell our house and I wanted to know what you felt about these re casting of alone what\nIf you don't ...\nI guess to do the deal is going to be have backup offers already in this other home\nOkay so ... this was a knock the manufactured home this is a homeowner\nYes the manufactured home actually stand even make a ten to twelve thousand dollars\nYou know how much of a much of an earth my trick that you put down\nWe put three thousand dollars and you're probably gonna lose that if you don't close right and and we're measuring\nRecover contingency on the sale of your other oh\nNo they would not allow him to continue to take out here a house gets sit and almost sold by the end of the day\nYou know showing them you know so muggy along market you know so I'm armed here's what you're doing you're getting desperate and every time I get desperate I get stupid and you're ... you need to not close on this house Thursday\nLet it go is okay for them telling myself in the house uh husband's at work and the only house to house\nAnd and you know we feel like we're getting throwing away her Ninety dollars a month this\nYear and you know you might be but it's just a house six hundred and Ninety dollars nature problem we're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back and I worked for two years you're up ...

mom okay not a lot of it all cash deal okay and\nWe just found out yesterday for a realtor which it sure does the kid had already put this application for weeks ago when we put the offer an for her and we just found out he didn't you\nJust need to sit there and you're manufacturing home manufactured home until you get at show when you get it sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchased me and if that means you rent for a little while in between major rent for a little while in between you really have the option to houses\nYeah I Know don't worry I needed to be honest I don't do a ... an hour before brother\nAppreciate that but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does wish I'd do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to go do things but you don't have to do anything\nUntil my husband left that we don't have any interest to house and you know it's just how you're airborne\nYou remember all your heart so big an open when you move to Colorado When you're going to try new adventure\nI Know everybody kind of the same militias the opposite of that I Know you're already like it's in a cage at ... ... yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now in Iraq or healing we have\nWhy you feel cornered is 'cause your corner [laughter] why you would feel court so you're on the air you know here's what you do in your corner you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYeah I did get let down my ... I Can't even get any\nMore I I it's not a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a voyage sons are now I mean I won't go out of Neal I'll be happy to close on this deal when my trailer sales [noise] yeah\nWhen my trailer is so my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so after you guys have to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you shouldn't clothes on\nThey should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it one 'cause you're just not gonna close\nIs if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up owning both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem\nIt's going to damage your finances it's going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell him just we're going to have the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can't and we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI'm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday and then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk that's exactly what they're calm down [noise]\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you for your service or thank you how can I help while I'm sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that have small mortgages\nAnd I just always say that we would probably sell one of the time or basically about now start now and then that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make for a year before they are\nYou in a way that on law held investment I don't know that that applies\nThat Saturday Night and I think I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with them I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable and yeah we've we've been I guess you'd say if that's all it but they're not the you know there is bread and butter rather than the three bedroom one bath houses\nThat's the best kind I stay rent it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] uh yeah yeah but as you said and I know you know from experience I mean when you're sick stay fifty five on this and you're saying you've been through with renters in\nMy if you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security ...\nI may or may not causes so scared a problem and may be passive income might not come up with Social Security but you might want to sell them anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate a good investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mess around with it [noise] that's that's a good investment and this is the\n...

probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right I'm going out and we decided to bang for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we want in probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd within where just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills
