some concerning news it sounds like cautionary tale perhaps about financing for some for next year Doug's got more with your Pifer\nFinancing your crime for next year good morning I'm Doug grouper and we're going to talk about that today with Joe Pfeifer egg and business legal strategies in Cedar Rapids not too long ago Joe gave me a to do list\nOh your numbers do the business or know what you're going to do if you want to farm next year have you got a line of credit in place Joe\nUp any more thoughts on that any more concerns\nIt's always difficult for a farmer to plan quite a ways than advance\nWe have to really be looking for next year's financing right now especially for farmers who've been experiencing loss\nIn their farming operations part of the reason for that is if they need to borrow money to put in next year's crop once they pay back this year as line of credit for a crop financing\nThe bank doesn't have to make them alone for next year's crop finance that was strange as that may seem if the bank says and know that the doctor a load of money to put next year's crop in that may be a good answer for them if they've been losing money repeatedly\nWe've talked before about what you call the debt snowball you lose money you borrow more money to keep things going\nYou pay off their shoes operating on but putting a loan or increase in the line of credit\nOn machinery or your land\nEvery time you don't pay back all of the debt that you borrowed for the shoes operations you make the principal some that you know greater so should make that principle some greater and especially now we've watched the interest rates on the um prime pickup three times and this past year and projected to\nIncrease again yet before the end of the year\nThat means that you're going to be paying more interest on the money you've got out there at some point if you don't start turning it around and make money that snowball called the debt snowballs going to roll back over you so if a bank says do\nIt can be the right answer and maybe get change something\nIn fact you do have to change something so at a appear to have less risk of loss or\nIf you're bound setting determined that you want to make certain you're going to farm next year\nIf you turn over that crop proceed to the bank the bank is going to necessarily loan money next year if you want to make certain or have a chance to farm again next year and you're concerned about that I Would be holding onto the checks\nAnd having a discussion with the bank are you going to finance we next year or not if the answer is
