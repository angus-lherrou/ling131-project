nine and I only at ... percent harvest that both on record on soybeans so\nThat's really it that's right what gave it to press the outside\nYeah I remember two thousand nine pretty well done and that it was in December before we got during that year that was just because of a slow maturing crop of cooler year this year than just the opposite faster maturing crops followed by the slowest like harvest ever it's just been nuts yeah\nYou know it really has been and I think the market when you had a a you know the phones pressing the short side of the market and then the new changes a little bit on ya uh you know I think that's a positive wasn't just the weather remember back to the crop report we had on Thursday\nThat was not as negative as the trait thought in fact actually it was a bit positive on corn and are not as negative on soybeans so I think that really was the start of things and then\nHow it goes that accelerated on it though but you know then ... after this rally I think you still have to be careful for producers standpoint because ah what we've done is moved up to some tough resistance areas and we're still anchored by big the eyes\nOf soybeans remember we could

you your name I'm doing great admired and to be down here in the U.K I might add or secretary of agriculture comes walking in your area to do I'm doing great my goodness what an just another great example of a a a one of our our latest you're good good for him to reward recipients and folks that are doing the right to ensure today's I'll tell you still get\nYeah I'm about thirty seconds on the porch of pork production talking pork researchers\nWell absolutely I mean my goodness ah Iowa's number one in Port production by far and and uh\nYou know we talk a lot about hey where's Iowa was placed in the world in terms of agriculture all about value added agriculture right so we're ... we lead the nation and corn and soybean production but it's what we do with that corn and soy that makes us different right we feed that into something that adds value\nEither an ethanol plant or a bio diesel plant or feed it to livestock and make\nProtein and here's a great example were very efficient that at very very good at it\nAnd we get a chance to export that port around the world as well so critically important to our economy\nYeah we're sitting here Mike in a country where there is an ethanol plant down Eddie vale which is probably what thirty miles away or last year and there was a A R that Hedrick why after your third ... be trying to write so there there used to in in hog feed so we're we're just eaten up everything we grow out\nThat's right and I thought of that very thing when we came by that feed that female I'd been down for the grand opening of that several years ago and just again think about the the corn that gets pulled into that that facility and we're taking that commodity agriculture\nTurning into something with higher value added jobs back to our economy value back to our economy and then we use that domestically we exported around the world\nNow you farm up in the cylinder sense yep north north of the cylinder saying or is it the cylinder saying we're talking about an area and so under the drains fairly well uh have you been in the field\nHigh water table to uh we have them but it's been it's been a slow go and uh you know like much of the state but we've been what we were what the beginning we're right in the middle and where would it be it I Know we got the snow over the past week in six months prior to that we'd had a blizzard up and and uh that that must bring cylinder area of the middle of April it's been a real challenge so\nWe've not turned a wheel on soybeans yet\nAnd we're about ten percent done on corn so we've got a lot of work yet to do I think what I think we're I think we're trying to roll today\nYou know normally this time of year we're sitting at a at least according to your office yes fifty percent of the soy beans so out of the ground\nThat's right and we ... we had a a you know it was challenging week right so I think we only ended up moving about one percent on soybeans last week Nineteen percent were eleven days behind the average car and we harvest it two percent of the crop up to I think Seventeen percent or something there about\nA now and so obviously behind now for days behind the average uh so again as folks get out there is a great to see the sun today over much of the state\nGot to get some temperatures are especially dry those beans down I Know I'm here in quite a bit about that and concerns about high moisture beans and the challenge there but ah hopefully this week we're going to get around here to to get back in the field\nWell we uh I had a a lesson here on uh the basics of it's only a bioreactor yes from Jim yeah and and that's that's a that's way cool stuff to see that going on here in the state of Iowa these guys are taking a that to clean water initiative a kind of\n... ride to run by the horns and putting it in practice on his part\nThey are and this is a great example of you know we've been doing conservation work in the state of Iowa for decades but this buyer actor concept that you just talked about this was something that was developed just in the last couple of years and it was developed right here in Iowa and so we also ... every time I think by or actor or or saturated buffer\nI'm reminded of the fact that we haven't learned the last thing that we're ever going to learn about water quality in the state and that we're leading the way in innovation right here in Iowa so critically important to have research done at Iowa State university\nAnd then you'd be able to get that practice on the ground out here like Jim did last year and be able to learn more from that process\nYeah it's it is it's it's rewarding and we're in an area that uh is uh one of the leaders in a cover crop yeah as well micro to take a break here for news copy
