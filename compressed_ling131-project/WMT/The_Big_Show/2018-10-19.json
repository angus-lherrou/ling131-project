probably is under reporting would also his got concerned as it's been marching its way across Europe most recently it was found in Belgium\nUm of course we don't want to hear\nAh now there's a we have

pushing the creation of um a foot in mouth a\nDisease vaccine disease bank for this country as well as money to go to our diagnostic labs as well as her state veterinarians to allow us to be better prepared to do a better job keeping diseases out now I think our government's done excellent job to this point\nUm but it's a biological deal and as we all know you know the wind blows across seas and things in this order and we have to be vigilant to keep it out and producers need to keep their biosecurity up\nAnd I'm In we all just need to be be attentive I wouldn't say we'll ever hair on fire

guys are talking about our research or maybe also water quality\nYes certainly Bible there's a number of things obviously is ... which is a very important time of year for us with regards to promotion you heard a Mike from jets rose talking about what they're doing\nAnd we also have the partners like fair way an IV\nThat are doing programs or other things that were working on is obviously very supportive of the new vet veterinary diagnostic lab and I stayed and are getting that into a position that uh hopefully it's a career a location\nUh I I think we forget sometimes a gym we have there\nThe diagnostic lab at Iowa State um they have samples come from all over the country and it's really world renowned with regards to their work so we want to keep them in that top notch facilities at appreciate\nWhat the legislature has done there obviously will continue to support a water quality efforts as a a move forward were a part of a war with a recorded I was sweeping the Iowa egg water alliance\nSo continue to look at project some programs\nTo uh protect the waters of our state\nYou know we talked to a ... minute ago about a African swine fever\nAnd uh I Know that our national level river Arkansas state level they are you guys tracking this is well\nOh hugely concern um you know understanding about a hundred and forty thousand jobs that I Would depend on the pork industry so I don't know where that puts us with regards to rank of cities but we'd be a pretty decent size towed if we all stood together so protecting that whether it's a\nA technician at a vet clinic or the ... truck driver or the producer themselves or somebody working at a processing plant uh we work very well with the uh my kid his team at the department of agriculture\nTo ah continue to develop plans and protections that we can put in place to secure the industry the best we can but obviously we got to work on it every day and producers I think particularly since this uh Africans wind fever announcement have become much more diligent over the last thirty to sixty\nDays my dad got joining us might go grab hold of that microphone will put your feet to the fire here\nUh so African swipe people we know it's national concern or statewide insurance uh we had the ... it's not the same disease but we had a situation with the poultry industry right ... years ago with a where something got in the state we didn't we didn't what so what what what's\nThe state of Iowa do I mean what are you guys are looking at right so absolutely we well we think often of that that a high path avian influenza outbreak largest animal disease outbreak in us history or back in twenty Fifteen or sixteen\nIn birds were impacted a nationwide about half of those were in Iowa so we were ground zero in a lot of ways and so you know it's experienced that frankly I Wish I didn't have that experience our team wishes we didn't have in the industry certainly wishes that they hadn't had to go through it but we did and uh so many lessons learned\nA you know pat talks about biosecurity right you'd think your you know you think you're doing a good job about security and then you really look at it more closely and you realize gosh there's some things we could be doing to enhance and so that's one of the things that the job is never done on that front we learn that loud and clear\nIn terms of what the state needs to do what we're working on is we just need to to generally ... increase our capacity to respond ah well actually let's do two things we need to increase our capacity to prepare\nAnd to work with industry on the front end the best thing that we can do to prevent this disease from ever coming to our shores God Forbid it does and then we've got to mount an effective response and so we need to build that capacity over the last couple of years\nWe've requested at the department of eggs some additional funding from the legislature to find a couple of new positions love a new veterinarian joining our team focused specifically on animal disease response preparedness that was a lesson learned from twenty Fifteen so uh that that's that's a couple of the things that we're uh we're working on at the department\nOf minutes here for we take a look what's going on in the marketplace dug but a Micah ... what are you know about this uh F. M. D. a possible bank of of vaccines what what what have you heard\nWell it's for the first of all it's a it's it's important that we get something done in this farm bill on a ... to even have the ability to use a vaccine as a tool or something is not available today we just don't have it as a possibility\nOr and so we've got to make sure that one where we're continuing to work on the research\nUh Neal mentioned it at mentioned it to and it's it's all but we also need to build that capacity at our\nAt our ah laboratories across the state again something we learned a very very well and twenty Fifteen and having the assets that we do in Ames with the animal or the national animal Disease Center the national debt services laboratory the I asked you that diagnostic lab\nThese become incredibly important assets as we're dealing with a a an outbreak so one next year we got tools and the tool box like vaccine so we need that done in the farm bill I think it's a very favorable I think we've we've got a good prospects to get that accomplish when the bill passes but to at the state level we need to make sure that we're providing that support\nAnd and the reason I ask because I mean you're sector of agriculture number one ... state so I mean if if anything I think they should be here\nWell and I well we wouldn't look we do it that way I look at that we've got a tremendous industry in this state got tremendous assets Iowa State university would get at significant USDA investment in the state I and what needs to be a leader on this on this issue on animal disease on pork in particular and so are\nWe view ourselves that way and together with our our great industry will continue to work to move the the dialogue forward in this country on on these issues\nThat Cooper markets are now ... what's going on being\n... by ...
