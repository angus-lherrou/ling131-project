talking trade news today so far\nYou are exactly right Bob pretty much all the new NAFTA agreement that has been agreed upon us and Canada and Mexico kind of just forgot about ... parish or and that pretty much your race all those losses just about a quarter at pretty much in support of this morning\nNow the process or that happens is\nThe the NAFTA agreement has to be sent now to what Congress and it has to be ratified with uh Mexico Canada and the U.S and then ah it will be signed a following that ratification in that signature won't come for I Believe sixty days is that right\nThat is correct sixty they kind of a waiting period with Congress and of course you know sixty days also passed the November election times so still could get a little tricky maybe a nice touch ups no if the power does flip Congress\nYeah so and I wish I had to pay more attention when I was the finer points of civics class for coming around um ten can Congress changed disagreement by any ... any chance or is it an up or down all or nothing\nI think it's an up or down bill kind of there's not going to be earrings or ah you know bringing different groups of say what do you want you know and and start you know that one off stuff around and stuff on you know this voted out or voted on it is what it is well\nIs the reason I ask that is because there's a class seven milk that Canada has and I I notice that was one of the bullet points as a candidate was going to drop their class seven a milk and as of late last week\nThat was not going to happen so that that really caught me by surprise\nRight as far as I have so far this morning that they extend that just puts on that not to completely free trade on that but I get lower it and then we met adjustment what the cars we're going to him or their their their vehicles coming out of work with is all I Know\nOkay so I as far as we know the adjustments [laughter] so that that's what I was asking\nAbout here so as far as we know there's no more adjustments to be made is that\nCorrect correct that is why I talk to our Congress voted\nAlright so that that's what's pushing his grain market uh had soybeans up Seventeen a plus corn up eight nine cents or not we're off and running and hogs too and I I I understand we're going to talk to your Jamie with the national\nPork producers 'cause uh this is a big deal for pork as well but we came out

Know there's beans that are probably ready to go but you know it's just a ... and it's just not going to work for a day or two but we're going to get some breeze and hopefully not a lot more ... ... ...\nIf I had to guess I Would say\nThirty to forty percent of the beans or harvest down here in the south east corner of the state and I'd say probably twenty to thirty percent of the corners harvest it so\nIt was a lot to go but uh you know what if if we keep this kind of weather that we are going to have this week it will be so bad Bob\nYeah so what's going on here with the ... group I thought about yesterday I was a kind of a nose in around are looking for some real estate sales what what are you guys got going\nWell we've got a a really good October October's usually at lots where we can regroup and we go out and talked about having sales that a\nReal estate sale could potentially get get put on yet this year or we could still close and do the transaction by the end of the year and so I think we put on ten or twelve sales last week\nUm the month of October I think we've only got about twenty eight sales company so it's kind of a regroup in time when farmers are in the field you know we're busy talking to farmers and not having a lot of sales but we are book a lot of sales you've got a lot of real estate we've got\nReal estate is coming up for sale all the way clear up in

Rosen a telephone line with us national pork producers council\nA big news in the marketplace or found out about it I guess late last night\nIs that the U.S Canada and Mexico apparently have come to an agreement on is no longer called NAFTA no longer called in North American free trade agreement to it but it is a trade deal between the three countries and pork producers in particular are kinda celebrating today right\n[noise] absolutely it's a it's a good timing for national pork month I don't know if you knew that Bob October as national pork months so we we've started off with a bang this agreement\nAnd we're really happy about that um there's obviously been a lot of uncertainty around trade with our North American trading partners and I think\nWith this agreement we've obviously eliminated a lot of that uncertainty\nNow you mentioned in a um a note you sent me that uh uh we now have zero tariffs access to three of the top five markets for us pork I I mean that I I guess alone is pretty big headline\n[noise] yeah that and that refers to uh the formal signing last week of a modernized freedom and free trade agreement with South Korea\nUh and that preserves zero tariffs access to that market which is are based on numbers last year it was our fifth largest market\nAnd then with Mexico and Canada a number one and number four on that list of export markets um well we don't we you know we we we still have a little ways to go before it's implemented the the the new pact that is the framework for the new pact that has been put in place does\nA includes zero tariffs access and it sure is that for the long term for us so that's great news\nNow the ... as far as the timeline goes here that the reason we're talking about a day to day and you say there's there's time\nIs that a Congress I Believe has to ratify the new U.S MCA is with us a call and I'm going to say that NAFTA was kind of float off your tongue a little bit I guess we can\nUse YMCA um [laughter] it was referred to it now yeah not not the it is and you you're right not real catch you with us a MCA so there's a a what a sixty day waiting period then is that that is that the deal or just\nYeah I I I think it's hard to to to know exactly what it will be implemented I I Would imagine I'm if I had to guess who you know it will be sometime next year I don't I don't think it will be um take it up any sooner than the next Congress a but we'll be watching closely we we plan on\nUm [noise] you know handling this as a as a key vote for our members meaning we're going to be watching\n'em you know how what kind of support we see from members of Congress\nOn this deal and making sure that our members have clear line of sight in on an yes or no votes we uh we think it makes sense for pork and all of agriculture so were were urging Congress to ratify as soon as they can\nYeah I got a note here from a senator Joni Ernst ... office or out of Iowa and she's talking about this and said ah ah one one of the highlights she says that Canada will eliminate its class\nSeven program for milk and I I Know that's not your you know your your sweet spot there but that that was kind of a big deal\n[noise] yeah I mean I think the dairy provisions were one of the sticking points with um you know making this a three way packed that includes Canada and so obviously good news\nThat that was resolved and that you know we we certainly were we we were very happy when the Mexico deal was put in place but our preference was a three way packed that is what we have and I'm a we're very happy that it's in place\nNow you say that that covers three of our top five markets who who were the other two markets were concerned with\n[noise] well China a and I think you know resolution to current trade disputes I think that's going to be a slower burn\nOr as you know the Trump Administration is working through a major realignment of us global trade strategy and policy\nUh I think they're weighing many many different interests across different industries in terms of our trading relationship with China we sent a over a billion dollars of\nOf pork to China last year it's the largest port consuming nation in the world obviously very important market for us and we hope to see a\nA return to more favorable access as soon as possible but I I'm a I don't know that that's on the immediate horizon but certainly the\nThe the news with Mexico and Canada is great news the the Korean finals they showed the Korean agreement is great we also had more good news or last week in that the U.S and Japan have announced plans to start\nNegotiations on a on a bilateral free trade agreement and that as far as offensive measures that has been on the top of our list yeah um you know most of our time over the last year has been spent\nDefending a existing free trade agreements and are on the on the you know in terms of going off and I'm having a bilateral that Japan is at the top of our list and and so that's that's good momentum to and I'm as you probably know Japan\nA is part of the new TPP agreement which we expect to be in place a next year\nAnd Japan has also formed a free trade agreement with the European Union that's looking to be finalized next year so uh it's good news that we are going to start free trade negotiations with Japan because without that we would be at serious risk of losing pork market share in uh another very large port consuming nation\nWell Jim ... I'll tell you the market seems to be buying into this pretty strong Rob a couple of blocks or even on the heels of a hog and big report that came out that shall we got a lot of livestock out

the highest quality quality pork of anywhere in the world\nAnd you know based on the promise of exports are industry has been\nIn expansion and investment mode and you know that has been a I think
