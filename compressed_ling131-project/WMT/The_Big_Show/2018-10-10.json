now ah and ah Tom as our market analyst with the gang narrative someone commodity brokerage and Tom fills my mailbox up every morning with his newsletter and I was reading it this morning\nAnd Tom one of the things you were a a talk a little bit about was the percentage of crop harvested not only here in state of Iowa but all across the Midwest so in the back of your mind Tommy or are you worried about how our getting this crap out of the field\nBut if you're a farmer that can get this crap I think there's a lot of reason to be on her yeah yeah in terms of market I mean every year when the crop doesn't get harvested well at a point that doesn't have that much effect on the big picture\nEspecially especially being where we've got such a huge carry out anyway and I understand if it's your farming shattering and all the other stuff that goes goes along with this ... whether it is a problem but I'm not sure and the big picture that big a deal I guess\nWell now here here's a question of the day our soybeans are taking a hit right now what's pushing this markets so so much lower\nWell I think there's a perception that Mars report is gonna is gonna show on ... number one you're going to have a job because of that stocks report at the end of the month you're going to jump carry out and number two I think the perception is going to from the ills of Bush will there too so you're you're potentially looking at a carry out\nIn the nine hundred million bushels area ... so I don't know it's kinda hard to get excited about the market especially since we've rallied a quite a bit I edited report here so I I guess I'm not at all surprised to see a little profit they can even in Morrow\nAnd I think his corn crops going to get a little more a how shall we say robust and the report tomorrow is well\nNow that's the perception I just I'm not so sure about that I ... up to this point the people that an average beans almost every one of those only smoked those are great I've got great ...\nI don't hear that so much from from guys harvesting corn it's a little more\nVariable and some good not so good and so I guess I'm not sure if there's a tendency historically one increased ill from August ... increase again from study in October so I think that's what a lot of people are going on I guess I'm not convinced that it's going to happen that are like\nI'll tell you what I'm going to wrap up with you here and talk to you again about an hour and ten minutes to get some price projections in the meantime how can other folks get a a a nice welcome or an email from you every
