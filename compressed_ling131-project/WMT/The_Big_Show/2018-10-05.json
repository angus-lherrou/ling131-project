what's coming our direction but we seem to be stuck\nIn a rain pattern and are now you guys are tells you may be stuck in it till middle of this month huh\n[laughter] yeah that's true thanks for having me on the big show appreciate the uh the invitation and uh right now there are some showers and thunder storms across\nSouthern Iowa that are moving towards the east north east bringing some rainfall that part of the state but attention then turns to more of a widespread rainfall events that were expecting to unpack much of the state through at least in the middle of next week\nHow much more water can we take here in ... in the state of Iowa I mean you guys are already posting flood watches uh for for lots of these rivers here in the state\nYes unfortunately the capacity is running pretty low especially once they get north of interstate eighty and highway thirty those places have received a lot of rain fall over the past month or so\nAnd the capacity is very low rivers are running very high right now for this time of year in fact many locations mainstream cages are studying daily record high flows for this time of year so I'm just an indication of how high the rivers are running\nIf there's any place in the states that could use some rainfall is probably southeast Iowa or there are some slight drought conditions are that are existing right now but much of the state or the capacity is pretty low for additional rainfall so any additional rain fall we get we're going to see a lot of runoff\nYeah I uh drove across the skunk yesterday near Ames and a crisscrossed the raccoons and both of them I mean they're not out yet at least rice on but they're but they're getting pretty much the banks will\n[noise] that's right a lot of the streams are running near bank full uh we do have some minor to moderate flooding especially when you get into eastern Iowa that part of the faith thing of a fair amount of flooding but in the central part of the state a lot of the streams are running very high a still within their banks but running a very high for this time of year\nTell me what's going to happen here over the next week or so\n[noise] we're expecting a multiple rounds of additional rain fall to ... uh impact much of Iowa or we could see additional rainfall amounts as high as four to six inches in some places and that again that's a lot of rainfall and a lot of run off\nSo we're expecting to the renewed and additional flooding over much of the state especially the the Saudis half to two thirds of Iowa with rivers coming out of their banks next week\nA flash flooding is also a possibility or however the primary threat would be river flooding in overland flooding we're not expecting a repeat of what we saw back in late June or early July of this year but that definitely more widespread flooding a terms of river flooding in overland flooding\nGot any more than Seventy five eighty degree days your back pocket there\nAnd fortunately no um that's the you know relatively unusual for this time of year and we're looking for a cooler temperatures especially with us rainfall around we'll have cloudy conditions and relatively cool conditions also\nHey Jeff at Sandy I'm curious bigger picture here in this what pattern when we get the middle of next week and finally this stuff cleared up is that it or is that just somewhat of a pause in the witness\nWell right now there's potential that it could be somewhat of a pause we're expecting some some dry conditions Andy uh maybe the the latter part of next week\nBut um we could see it's been renewed wet conditions just depending on what happens with some tropical systems out in the Pacific ocean and also the Gulf of Mexico we could see a return to some wet conditions\nOver the next two week period once we get a chance to dry out a little bit during the latter part of next week\nHow unusual is it to be this ... this long this light\n[noise] it's quite unusual and that's reflected in the uh not only the stream flows which you get a lot of the stream gauges across the state or studying record high flows for this time of year but also just the soil moisture when you compare it to normal as much above normal in fact to someplace as we're seeing a almost record high a soil", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Show", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "05"}
