not moving to market I guess right now\nWell you know I think the dominant issue good morning first of all but I think the dominant issue has been this week it's been the weather and it's just been a a wet forecast well it looks like the end of the week here as we get closer the weekend we have a cooler dryer for cats\nSo it gives us the chance to get back in the field though over a good portion of the corn belt so I think that is it and then also positioning for the crop report on Thursday expected that to be applied area so that is also laying on the market so I think it's the one two punch here at the present time and it's harvest time\nYeah well yeah and and we'd like to be participating more here in the state of Iowa in in that harbors so no no real concerns and they were getting a little late huh\n[noise] no I think there are a concern particularly when you get into Iowa Minnesota\nOr some of this western corn belt um you know the Dakotas they're trying to harvest and they're talking about even four inches of snow here coming at us and short order so it is a concern and I think it does bring up even when we get a you know the report coming out here and in the Thursday\nOr is that going to be a solid reporter did we have some losses but afternoon expect corn and soybean harvest to be somewhere around that thirty to thirty three per se done so you know we are\nOur long

weather\n... Doug yeah and I think that's right I Will be interesting to see ones what he says because there's no doubt that we have a lot of being in the field and that's a real issue is a absorbs moisture but then we have a an issue with the quality of the stock out here we happened to get them when\nI'm you know and it's just it's not a an ideal harvest situation so far so you know every year like we say

it is it is an issue you know I we ... it isn't that some well it is it's concerning for the producer when you have that you're now you're a big portion of the crop spill in the field and you know you're struggling so there's a lot of nervousness out here you know trust me no doubt about it but\nUm you know we'll get it out you know there are just\nA matter of how timely but it you know I think it's more important when we look at this report on Thursday our weekend her we act to the report whether it's negative or positive betrayed\nDefinitely anticipating a negative report expecting bigger yields a half a Bush will hire are expecting production to go up you know around fifty million on corn and soybeans expecting to stock\nRemember the ... the number one stocks were larger on both corn and beans so this will be carried over in this report so\nExpect a supply negative report but then how do we react to it at these price levels producers are interested in selling a you know there's no

the get by with faith today and uh my goal is the guy that puts all this together biggest one Mike a lot of people here it looks pretty impressive\nYeah it's been a great turnout um we have two hundred Seventy seven companies here which is are actually ties are larger than ever any out of faith in this economy and as such that that's just a credit to our students are programs here but yeah we're beyond thrilled outside of the weather we're beyond thrilled to have\n'em all these companies here [noise]\nHopefully didn't deter the the students and it's too much but last year we had about twenty five twenty six hundred students from a lot of different schools here so knock on wood the next five hours do pretty well for us well that's what I was\nGoing to say is you guys put this together and the College of life sciences but it really extends campus wide which is\nA credit it can extend standpoint I think so Cal says about twenty five or twenty six meters and last year we had Seventy two majors go through it from Iowa State alone but we had students from\nEighteen other schools here and I actually had a girl they called me from\nMississippi State about three weeks ago and I come to the event or like absolutely it's open the public but it's always interesting to see where these kids are coming from in terms of other schools out there which again\nSpeaks volume for the event\nNow what are you hearing in terms of a challenge of employment wise from the people here you know um I\nHaven't heard a lot which is which is surprising I think the bottom line is is is that good talented people especially in the egg industry will always be in high demand um what's interesting here today is that we've got\nProbably thirty five brand new companies that are here for the first time and so\nWhat I mentioned before in terms of the demand for ... or so\nDespite the economy despite the tariffs implications quite arranged going on out there\nIt's a good story yeah success story and I'm just by the time that they mentioned although you know we keep hearing about large fields prices maybe down but bushels make up for this industry continues to get better at a at what they do\nWhich is amazing considering\nThey've always been the best in any way or the leader of the world to start with\nNo surprise me that people are just driven that way you know we want to take it from good degrade really really quickly there but bottom line is is um\nHaggis pretty top heavy in boomers right and and it is a great area for young people to be in and so they're they're always going to be a high demand\nWe've been talking about that for a while with the aging population you see any ship the matter is the continuing to get older here and you know some young people get in and then the other direction for one way shape or one reason one way shape report\nRight that's a good question and we've been talking about it for a decade now and you know maybe it always whenever they pay and it had a real lined up the boomers retirement strategy there but we're starting to see more of it will see a lot of companies that are here\nWe may not have an open position but we want to get bench strength and when it does happen [noise]\nOff those students go\nYears out there so um I think\nWith the strongest economy has been the last five years\nWe're going to start to see these people\nDefinitely exit the workforce there you know and and the other challenges to people are working longer living longer than working longer what am I going to do what retirement\nLittle bit of a bottleneck there but I think as I mentioned before with the economy picking up [noise]\nI Would hope really start to see that exit of a lot of boomers out of there\nSure that you need to be industrial by the way it might be more common and it's in history but boy I don't know you guys have got um ... are you going to get any bigger it looks like you're about to face\nEvery day thinking all by you

serious find camping interview tomorrow or business you interview daddy or will probably run\nA hundred eight hundred interviews through here so this was a great event for them\nTo fill out their

Fifteen and how the uh folks you represent would like to see a a Fifteen year round looks like a today is is gonna be the day it\nThat way that this is pretty exciting for it I don't know yet and credit and form\nA line you're on his promise and we believe that if I'm In the future and it's an ounce should\nTake away the air ears on to the growth that there's really three three hurdles out there for us to grab it fails and certainly taking away then yeah waiver requirement the help in that manner\nOkay let me ask you you got me down this road ah there's three barriers so one of them is proving it a year round what's the what's the other two barriers\nAnd most important to our membership and that is um the retailers the state of Iowa is having a required infrastructure and equipment in place to add up all the team today\nAre like ... percent of the equipment statewide it actually started a fight it out of\nEight or\nTen Fifteen and higher Lang at alligator background you\nYou're you're doing fine you you you caught my interest here a Fifteen Percent\nYou say of the equipment out there is qualified that that seems like a a low number to me and my missing something it's\nA terribly low number and so that's why programs like the Iowa renewable fuels infrastructure program that helps to invest in this aging infrastructure and make sure that we have grants available to help people upgrade their equipment is just so critical to the growth of beef that gene I'm\nLeaving that a lot and helping\nA retailers and station upgrade their equipment for this new fuel on it requires a different type of um compatibility different from each ten so we have to make sure that\nPiping the tanks the dispensers\nMa right down to them the steals the gasket everything has to you all certified or the higher blends of ethanol and if we don't do that and there was a big chance that you know we could have an equipment failure and we could be you know in addition of contaminated environment which none of us one where we're all for environmental protection\nWhich are about consumer protection so making sure that we have the right infrastructure in place to live and it's a chain is very very important\n... how can we move forward\nWell it it is going to check investment um you know most of the location that deli Fifteen today are new location new equipment new installations so we have a lot of independently owned businesses out there in a rural areas and even in the cities\nThat are going to need some assistance in order to be able to upgrade their equipment and be up for this deal\nSo that helped me out here are done by the way we're talking with dawn Carlson dawn as president and a CEO and she's with the petroleum marketers and convenience stores are violent other words or your the people that are dispense a fuel\nUm helped me out here with a with the the the uh the announcement then it itself or is it ah what what kind of mark is going to open up I mean is it a big deal ah or do we need to other things first well\nIt it is a big deal because I'm\nAllowing each Fifteen to be sold year round legally is one of the three critical you know come on and right now we're only selling about twenty seven million gallons and eat the teen a year that's out of about ... billion gallons of gasoline\nAnd we have a long ways to go and there's a great opportunity to shop Maurice Fifteen and and certainly being able to sell it in the summertime\nWill be helpful but I'm honestly that's not going to move the needle until we get all of this equipment and dispensers upgraded so that you know we can actually dispensed that legally\nNow what what what was the third leg of the stool here that we need to fix up here the\nWell we used to leave 'em consumer protection must be a priority in offering any field including the Fifteen\nAnd I'm oddly enough eat Fifteen is the only field product out there that is required to have a warning label on it um there's an EPA wanting level that is required on every dispensers that's offering me Fifteen\nAnd it's it's a learning to consumers that they need to be\nEvaluating their vehicle\nUm he Fifteen can only be used to thousand and one\nAnd knew where I'm passenger vehicles worked like a vehicle so not every vehicle it's compatible with it at some point you know when all the older to vehicles are off the road I'm sure the warning labels probably go away but um you know consumers need to know what they're filling up\nAnd having a Fifteen ... they know what the product is and whether or not it's compatible with their equipment it's really important so you know our organization really value is your choice we want consumers to have options we value the quality of fair competition\nRumor and environmental protection and innovation and\nCertainly consumer protection the labor and aspect is very important um environmental protection having the right equipment available to spend the Fifteen it's critical so you know those three elements I'm I think we're on the right path to get expanded sales of e Fifteen and\nWon't dog you hang on because I got another question or two for you but right now we need to stop what we're doing and give some folks a chance to put a grand in their hand how about [noise]\n\nUh two hundred two hundred is the number text bank be eight and pay\nOur confirmation or messaging interests lie\nAbout that or we'd love to put a grand in your hand up there on Carlson is with us here we're moving along with the big show we expect\nAn announcement in fact we've been kinda tipped off to it that it's going to happen a little bit later about an hour and a half right now that we're going to get to the president's going to announce it or he is asking\nThe EPA to approve year round sales of e Fifteen and dogs are kind of our ah contact we use a was the folks that are out there every day selling this uh this stuff for the convenience stores across state of Iowa\nThey Don this is Doug um are there any financial incentives for all employees that are can be used to love Rudy infrastructure\nYes actually there is a infrastructure grant program with the state of Iowa that retailers can apply for cost sharing Brandt up to as much as fifty thousand dollars per facility and it's in some cases you know it's going to cost two or three times is to upgrade all of the dispensaries and and equipment but every\nBit helped um so that's money that comes up for renewal or consideration by the legislature every year and it's part of a program that we've been
