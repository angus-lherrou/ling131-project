Peterson as well and we are talking numbers right now USDA report out about a thirty five minutes ago\nDon rose and the telephone line with us us commodities in West Des Moines Don I'm a reading my uh Crayola scratching here that I always make it on these numbers and a corn crop down a little bit was the first surprise I saw what do you think\nKnow most definitely Bob you know good morning but I think when you look at the report I think you can say it was really just kind of a relief for the people that were thinking big crops get bigger because\nIn this report the bottom line the yield went down six tenths of a bushel breaker that was a surprise and the report historically we have had a tendency to go up not down so\nWhen you look at it from the demand side on the court did take export up Seventy five million did not make an adjustment for the do change and they eat a Fifteen hopefully for the summer but the bottom line is took ending stocks on corn only up thirty nine million\nTo a field just over one point eight billion so that was a bit of a surprise being I think it's more just a still a negative\nThe ending stocks but not as negative as the trade had feared and so we're getting a positive reaction took a harvested acres down six hundred thousand and the yield only up six tenths of a bushel so\nAh they left all of the demand side of it on chain so uh that's where we're at in a production down just three billion bushels\nYeah it's kinda crazy done that that would be record record soybean crop in terms of overall production but ah but yet somehow that's seen positively pie the market\nOut you know and I think it just tells us that Andy how are the futures market really works as\nWe've had so much of this negative news already dialed in and spend a pile on effect and you know it's that time of year where we've got that dialed in our midst as you know is going slow quality issues are out here\nAnd so the trade even though we're close to nine hundred million carry out which is just monstrous sounds like a core and carry out the market does not want to press the downside particularly with the Chinese still actively buying soybeans in the world\nHey Don six hundred million dropping harvested acres in soybeans were were those acres go\nYeah good question most of those acres came from Kansas down\nOr a hundred million I actually uh I I think went up just a little bit but you know I think another surprises I took I was yield uh from sixty to sixty one bushels an acre and we've got issues out here we are still harvesting the crop as you know\nStill harvesting you were to start in\nStarted yet in the last report what Fifteen Percent Iowa harvest it so you know that's very much uncertain here when you hear some of the quality issues out here\nA Kansas I I think they're expecting some freezing weather here to the next day or two as far south as Kansas now um we see a lot of pictures of snow the Dakotas course um but but bottom line is this report doesn't take into effect harbors problems doesn't\nKnow it doesn't this is ... and that's what I thought\nOf as of the first of October and then they make some minor adjustments I think you can they also they didn't jump to the conclusion that we're going to have an\nIncrease in the ethanol you seek either in this report all those that was just announced and it has to go
