congratulations that you know we've had\nFour years in a row or successive years in a row where we'll just get a little bit better than a little bit better each year\nUm I Know that hey what are the

second year in a row and boy they are all sorts of things that we could talk about what those yields terms of the you'll goals and trying to learn and plan for next year but I Want to get into this um the resistance issue and the bt trait\nMarket there'd been a few of these I think documented in the past if I'm correct but ah this is what the first one to the Hercules straight down in the Delaware county\nYeah as I understand that um we had roughly four main\nTraits of his students and this was the fourth and final one that was no longer you know that we're still trying to resistance the other three had\nYou know that are insect resistance had been making inroads for a few years already [noise] still have this one and now it's just one of those practices like another breach in the wall and uh\nIt's been years since I've had use insecticides for planting corn corn or I may have to go back to that again I may have by some expensive attached to put them on my plan for the next few years\nAnd uh and and you just added to work at planting time too with another product to apply let's take the opportunity to do more to talk about ah what the BP trade is there's a lot of a fear out there are a lot of emotion a lot of misinformation or when it comes to what you're dealing with that basically my understanding is\nThis is a protein in the plant that I'm resists ... learned damage\nYeah I Can't tell you exactly how it works um but I Would say this the United states leaves the world and the production of crafty lawyers and if after twenty plus years they haven't been able to find a way to ah bring a successful\nLawsuit against biotechnology um then maybe there just isn't anything wrong with it because you know there's enough people looking for something wrong with it it's ah all these trades all ... than tested\nRepeatedly and yet except for one recent jury decision in California uh there has not been anything wrong with it and I think that court this California will be probably overturned on February ...\nYou're talking about the roundup case up\nThere right yeah yeah like I said lots and lots of people have been looking for years to find something wrong with biotechnology and if we can't find that with all the lawsuit seeking lawyers in this country is it ever going to happen\nYour basic basically the proteins in the plant naturally occurring proteins or a normal part of the plant that\nAllow or disallow for different features and this involves turning on and off different proteins to\nAh create different in this case resistant varieties but um you were talking about going back to insecticides what's the recommendation here because we don't want to wind up like the weed resistance to herbicides now right so you're talking about rotations and an insecticide type of thing\nYeah we can't do the exact same thing year after year and I know that's something that's\nEasy uh you know one round the soybeans came out pretty much everybody pointed roundup soybeans and nothing else within a couple of years I we have to uh\nWe have to bite the bullet and do the hard thing which means plant and different uh products try\nDifferent crops different rotations or don't just plant court after court after Corning used the exact same few genetic tools that are supposed to or we don't have many how many weapons in our arsenal and we've just lost another one so we need the\nCarefully take care of the ones we have left us\nBut come on mark the number one reason to do it that way if that's the way we've always done it
