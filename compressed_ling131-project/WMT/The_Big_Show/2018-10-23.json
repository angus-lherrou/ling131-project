Peterson as well are they are in their seats and we are on W. H. O. radio of course of the more none W. M. T. in Cedar Rapids sending a signal out from a central Nebraska\nAll the way the northern Kentucky being brought to impart today of the gang from hurts far management of of course a big thank you going out\nTo Iowa corn as well well uh fellows are we're talking with a nagging Tim ... from the start this around off around about four minutes your guys are and we're going to talk about water quality so we want to talk about a water quality and how we're doing so far with water quality initiative here in the state of Iowa\nAnd talk a little bit about a funding and some of the programs in place and uh maybe give us a report card and how to improve on that so uh my dad got about four minutes of airtime here well excellent\nThank you you know we have made tremendous progress on our efforts to improve water quality in the in the state of Iowa so we look back into the end of may we celebrated the fifth anniversary of Iowa's nutrient reduction strategy so\nWe've got decades of experience working on on soils conservation soil erosion prevention and the state but really it took its it's taken a renewed effort a new look at\nA ... addressing water quality and nitrates in particular and so we developed a nutrient reduction strategy and and I really lays out the framework for how to move ahead on improving that that water quality was a big part of why I joined the department of egg is the deputy back in twenty Thirteen was to come in and implement the strategy\nAnd so very proud of of the work that's been done both in the urban and in the rural landscape and you think you mentioned that by before about how there there is work being done in both areas that you know it's one of those core\nPrinciples of the strategy right one is that it's built on a scientific basis so we did a first of its kind science assessment at Iowa State university that says when you do X practice it has actually impact on the water\nOr we don't spend dollars on practices that are proven through science to to have an impact\nAnd the second piece is that uh we need to work both in the urban and the rural landscape the days of pointing fingers at each other and saying it's your fault it's your fault have to be over we need to with renewed effort of work in a all landscapes across the state of Iowa and the third piece being that we have\nA great framework in terms of soil conservation or near the historical work Iowa was first in the nation to devote state dollars to soil conservation car share back in the seventies right we've been a leader\nAnd as we have that framework that works you build a culture of conservation not a culture of regulation and uh and that's what we're trying to do through the strategy so I'm a again we we spent the first couple of years really working on demonstrating some practices that folks didn't have a lot of experience with you know cover crops more widespread across the state\nUh what wins by reactors saturated buffers the new types of practices right that we needed to show demonstrate have folks\nAgain and understanding of and now we have an opportunity to really scale up our efforts to really move from that demonstration phase\nTo an implementation phase and scale of work and so some of the things that we're doing right now and you know I think we'll talk funding here but the Senate file five twelve or something that we\nSecured this pass legislative session the first time that we've had long term dedicated funding for water quality or in the state to uh to to specific to implement the nutrient reduction strategy or doing is is a targeting those dollars in some in some watersheds across the states north raccoons middle seat or\nThe south skunk putting boots on the ground to go work with landowners to farmers to to get work done um you know I think the other piece that I Want to highlight is that I really as a leader in this effort so I co chair the Gulf hypoxia task force which is the uh states represented throughout the Mississippi\nRiver basin together I co chair with a representative from EPA office of water\nAnd uh this is a place where the states get together worked together share ideas and uh and work with throughout the region to have an impact on the Gulf of Mexico ultimately so\nThat we have that co chair position because we are recognized as being a leader on this issue in in the in the region and so I'm very proud of that and we're gonna continue to do that you know Iowa's nutrient reduction strategies a model for other states across the region and uh and with good reason because it's the right to the right direction to go so\nThe coalition works for you to develop a winning strategy or\nWhether it's finding the best site for a newborn or feedlot

C. understand the damage in danger to Iowa was economy if they keep pursuing a incoherent and not quite the understanding the the impact than we have here\nOn Iowa was calming\nTim talk a little bit about uh animal agriculture we're going to have a follow up question here but Mike let's talk a little bit about animal agriculture a growth and a plan for a continued growth in\nThe bed so you know animal agriculture is the I like to say the ultimate value added agriculture\nI you know again we we feed look at a pork production number one and pork production and we feed about twenty five percent of our corn and soybeans to that pork industry and again create value than we process pork here we extract more value and then you know we can\nSell that domestically or export that around the world so there's just a tremendous a generator of of value to the economy in in this process and I think uh we do have a tremendous opportunity in the state one world leader until we got opportunity for more growth\nLook at the global demand zoom out look at the big picture one point uh well let's not talk China let's go a bigger a nine and a half billion ... billion people by twenty fifty in this country in this world a you've got rising incomes and improving standards of living around the world would of folks want when that happens they want more protein in their diet\nIowa was tremendous position to take advantage of that marketplace and to be that protein supplier to the world you know think of Iowa and protein production like you would think of Texas and oil production or silicone valley in technology right this is something that we can absolutely\nOwned this space and and really drive value and also you mentioned our leadership position in pork\nAnd beef and eggs or you know strong and dairy and and turkey as well\nI think we've got an opportunity to expand some poultry production in western Iowa we're looking at ... culture\nAs a it'd be able to scale up and and really you know produce at a significant level we're at the crossroads of the country or we can easily export and move up you know fish around the awkward culture products around the country and I think that's a tremendous opportunity for as\nA don't forget this lifestyle continues to be one of those great opportunities for our young people to get into agriculture for them to get back into their from a family farm operation to generate some cash to build some equity and so uh it's important that we\nContinue to have a a thriving growing animal agriculture sector and the state with that we need to make sure that we're uh we're supporting that industry one of the things I I focus on a lot as secretary is our efforts around animal disease response preparedness applying the lessons learned from a twenty Fifteen\nA Hi Pat avian influenza outbreak\nExperience we all wish we didn't have especially our producers but we do\nAnd as we apply those lessons and were scaling up and building our capacity at the department\nOr to to work with our industries on\nPreventing disease outbreaks a but also looking at the capacity to respond to God Forbid we ever would need to again so and that's something that's being incredibly important part of the job of secretary has to be leading and to have that kind of experience and be able to respond they won in that situation\nWell fellows though we'll have another three minute question here uh let's talk about uh doing some research for a animal agriculture Tim I'll throw it over to you for a question uh talk a little bit about research and funded research or are we doing enough to fund research or when it comes to a animal agriculture what do you think\nI I don't think we're doing enough when it comes to funding research or at any level\nThe the the\nCut off organizations play an important role in this but the state of Iowa has had a flat lined budget for the I experiment station at Iowa State for the last five years and it's not it's about eighty percent of what our high water mark was Fifteen sixteen years ago and so that's why I said that the next legislature the next governor\nShould over the next four years increase the state investment in the experiment station\nA little over a million dollars a year to get us up to thirty five million dollars a talking with a Cathy we'll techie who used to be the dean at Iowa State College of agriculture and then was the under secretary for research at USDA when I was there she said you know that's the kind of pragmatic but doable uh\nInvestment over a couple of years' time that will send a strong message that the state of Iowa in Iowa State university wants to continue to be at the forefront of that important research\nAnd I am on the animal side we've got to get the a veterinarian diagnostic laboratory built a if we lost that accreditation that it has it would be a tremendous a negative to our state we're we're very fortunate to have\nIowa State University in the same location as the as USDA built a national animal Disease Center and so there's a lot of synergy is that we can work through their um but I think we've got to get that investment uh\n'cause we got to continue being more productive we've got to continue doing it while uh be more productive while we take better care of the soil and water and we've got to figure out what are those commercial opportunities that we can take out of research like the\nThe soy wax a that can replace paraffin I referenced earlier I mean these are things that will have a multiple benefits to our entire state's economy [noise]\nMy neck a talk a little bit about a research for animal agriculture what direction should we\nTake oh you bet ah well again what an important part of our our economy right to look at again Iowa's leadership leadership position and livestock you know word number two in the country in terms of the value of the [noise]\nFive eight hundred three to four and six or seven times\nThat

markets again towards the end of the program or let's get back\nInto it they'll probably want to talk about trade we hear a lot about trade and how it affects the day in day out operational do right here in the state of Iowa so my dad go to a four minute time limit or answer on trade how can we build a new markets in it and improve the outlook for trade I guess you bet\nMade me go back and I want to address one thing about your kind of the premise of your question about the next big thing you know I agree that trading\nAnd particularly protein export is is important like I talked about in the last the last segment but don't forget though that we do have some opportunity yet to ah see growth and see a new opportunities in just expanding our bio based product development ... bio based product of a production you know\nUsing a biological material to make things that are currently made by petroleum right there still opportunity there there's new science that's coming I I think that's still an area that we see tremendous girl so don't forget about that piece in in you know in terms of the future\nA market situation again I go back to uh I always got a tremendous opportunity in terms of exports\nGoing back to that what would I talked about before with the global demographics global population growth and we just came through the world food prize of\nA you know events last week and it's a great perspective builder on the need for calories and in fact this this past week the focus was on not just calories but nutrition as well\nAnd again protein can be a big a big piece of that so that the the big picture the global demographics are right to still have a tremendous opportunity to export around the world\nSo uh how do we get there well there's no doubt that the current situation is causing it's impacting our markets negatively there's no doubt about it you know we had a chance last week\nA USDA undersecretary for trade and foreign affairs Ted McKinney was in the state I had a great conversation with him\nUh we all we hosted a roundtable with the leaders from our aid groups ah you know into two again have a candid conversation with dead McKinney about that what the administration's doing what they need to do I say we're always Iowa nice when we have a chance to talk with these\nUh USDA and and uh administration officials but we are direct because I don't want anyone to leave the stage in missile understand where we are and the importance of egg of exports on our agriculture\nAnd the fact that we're being impacted negatively today so I think we accomplish that mission with Ted and will continue to advocate for that\nUm you know we again need to be playing offense on trade China's a China's a challenge or we need to or we need to get the Chinese to the table I think most folks understand that there are real issues\nIn terms of intellectual property theft of force joint ventures or you know it's not like we had a great relationship with China before right and they had blocked corn duty jeeze ethanol\nA beef poultry we should be participating in a much higher\nRate in their market with those products today but they are blocking us and so are there are there's work that needs to be done there there is no doubt\nBut the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our markets so we must see action at I'm encouraged by the progress that we've seen on us MCA I'm encouraged that we're entering into bilateral negotiations with Japan\nThe EU the u._k. that's a great start but we've got to continue that momentum you know a lot of us in agriculture were supportive of TPP uh and and working across the Asia Pacific rim we need to play\nA ... and and pursue additional bilateral trade agreements with those countries as well so the big picture is tremendous opportunity for us to continue to supply products to the world we can be the quality consistent supplier that the world knows us to be a that that means we've got to go take action and uh and make progress here\nOr I might Jim Gannon let's talk trade are talking about a building new markets and impact of trade on this right here in Iowa\nYou but I but I I also want to go back to what you said uh what is the next ... moment before we went to that last break\nAnd honestly I think there's a potential aha moment if EPA would just reallocate the two point two five billion gallons of ethanol and three hundred million gallons of bio diesel demand that's been destroyed by these waivers that they've been handing out a profitable oil refiners", "show_name": "The Big Show",
