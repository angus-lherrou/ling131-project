nationwide contest\nBut let's get right to it here Doug with Charlie her\nVery well would bring him to the microphone Charlie we read his statement you sent me a last week about some of your concerns with soybean I thought it'd be a good idea if we can get an update from us to where we stand right now\nWell dug up you know it's a little bit better now that is what we had last week as a result of of being sitting in\nIn water and heavy rain for so long that didn't get any better but at least didn't get any worse we've had a beautiful week for or field right now much more so\nThan we would normally expect we had far more dried out and in the late October and now and probably in early November then you might expect so uh the damage problem are still there and I still hope that folks are riding around\nThe low places than other places that have have the damage beans issue\nSo we don't mix the men but at least we've taken some of the moisture out in the field and and and so probably isn't going to get any worse\nWell it has been a frustrating a growing season in many ways and it's just kind of adds to it ah best advice at this point what her elevators dune what are they seen one stuff comes in there what are you hearing oh\nWell the best advice for the producer is to to isolate the beans that have those various damages that um as much as possible\nError rate them for a while they probably will look a little bit better on the commercial side at after a couple of weeks on the commercial side uh we're now getting in to the impact\nOf the hurricane as well as what happened here\nIn the the the marketing system the marketing chain is pretty well saturated with damage I read a piece yesterday from\nFrom us be about southern soybeans and and and the impact of the hurricanes and the need to damage beans aside I Would I Would make that\nSame statement here uh don't mix them in with good beans because the marketing system doesn't have a lot of slack in it\nTo make the three percent that would be required to export\nAs you're going through the field that combine Charlie it's tough to tell I guess in some cases so how do you try and sort all this stuff out between good beans and damage beans and ... may be safe parts of the field and what may not be\n... it don't have a crystal ball and you don't have a perfect way of doing that a typically the beans that were affected are are in the lower places replant later ... touring varieties maybe\nA a a a a a pre harvest scouting will help\nAll that is just wholesome some beans shell some pause and find out\nIf we've got areas in the field or if there's a general issue of damaged soybeans areas drive around them and leave them or if it though if it's an entire variety than tires trip or something then you're going to have to bend them separately\nEight and ... them and hopefully will they will things will look a little bit better and two or three weeks\nAnd we talked to a world Andy talking to you Dan ... we're going to go up and gr now and they're storing soybean outside um I don't remember seeing a lot of that in the past or are there dangers in that or can they keep that ah the soybean okay out there\nIf it doesn't rain or snow they'll probably be by\nA yes it's risky and no you don't see very often I just I have a picture that I got the other day profile of soybeans and South Dakota uh if we don't we don't get rain to end the rain in that case will soak them up but it will also loose in the halls and\nAnd make them look a quite a bit more shriveled\nIf we don't get rain we should be okay I I'm assuming that that uh outdoor piles of soybeans are planned to be picked up very quickly\nMy more so than the court said covered with air on them I'm so dry and prevent that which that\nThat that for the the the outdoor outdoor storage is that have tarps and an ...\nFan that actually not too bad story for five or six months or even a little bit farther\nAh that's not exactly an outdoor pile I think we kinda get wound up in the terminology here at an outdoor pile from from my perspective is you drop them outside that nothing over I'm nowhere nothing and and I have that where they are doing that in in the Dakotas hopefully they won't ...\nCharlie uh ... we're running late here but give me just I'm really you know like thirty seconds a\nSummary of what we've talked about\nA well try to avoid mixing or damage beans with good beans the ... the markets system isn't able to handle them one thing we didn't talk about oil in the center of course out of being that's going to be very important this year with all the various ah damage as foreign material and there\nAre on the corn side exit on the inside to take advantage of this weather we have low to point get it cold and

some people were expecting that is great you know a lot of what your weather Weather Channel has grown in anything that\n[noise] that crop has been put through this year\nYeah this year after year how amazing it is that these hybrids and the varieties of soybean are able to\nWithstand just about whatever Mother Nature can throw at him and produce a decent crop so or maybe we're seeing another example of that just not going to be record high yields but higher than you expected\nAnd uh some of the management techniques coming back to pay off as well in in what we're seeing yeah it is it's
