here as Farm Bureau has released the latest version of their grocery shoppers survey and we'll talk to them about what our customers are interested to hear today on the show Hi Lori how's it going\nIt's great Andy how are you guys doing\nWell it's always good to visit with you of course and uh learn what it is that we ought to be providing in order to fulfill the needs and desires of those who are going to consume our products it's the Iowa Farm Bureau food and farm index and are quite a few headlines that looks like coming out of this latest survey\nThat's absolutely right and you know this is the fifth year that we've had the Iowa Farm Bureau food and farm index and you know it reaffirms what I think you and I would say all along Iowans are common sense folks and they like to keep it real thick if civically\nOut some of the things that we asked in this particular survey this year had to do with them labeled\nNow we do know and this is what we've seen over the last five years that about eight and ten Iowans say they do pay attention to label this survey was done by Harris Harris Poll and it was an online survey among five hundred and eight Iowans\nAge twenty to sixty who say they're the ones who do the primary grocery shop bringing food preparation for their families for their homes\nSo we wanted to find out what's driving their decisions at the grocery store what issues are top of mind for those folks that are shopping for foods what did they like what did they not like when it comes to label and\nWhat really matters the most to them and we found out that once again price is what's driving their choice more than anything else that's fancy on the label price sixty six percent that's their number one thing driving the choices on the label then they like freshness that sixty three percent and taste came out at sixty one percent\nWe had some really interesting things come up with that whole ah what do you think about those labels with steak milk fake meat you know what do you think about some of that stuff and I know that certainly making the news for you guys have been talking about it too\nYeah we have in a generally was on with us yesterday a big convention going on in the DC trying to figure out how that's going to shake out it's interesting though Laurie should we be concerned that the price is the main driver over these things like fresh innocent quality or is that distinction a minor when\nWhen that distinction is I think what it means though so many times is that\nYou know when you talk about where it was a ground how was the grown what's on the label I mean these are all things that do matter to Iowans Iowa grocery shoppers but they are looking for a bargain they're looking for they have budget to stay within\nUm and they do pay attention to labels but they want to make sure that they're getting the best deal about what they're buying whether it's\nA cut of meat or milk or now milk for that one it was freshness was number one they look at the date before they put that carton of milk and they're in their cart so I think that's a good thing too but it it shows two that I thought was interesting was that of the folks that are paying attention to labels\nSeven and ten it's about sixty nine percent don't agree that plant based and lab grown meat substitutes should be allowed to use meat on her labels or milk on their labels and only three and ten would be likely to buy that imitation meat even if it was sitting right next to a\nTo regular pork chops on the shelf\nAnd then a six and ten don't agree that plant based those no substitute should be allowed to use milk on their labels and less than half would even by that you know the milk substitutes are other theories substitutes so they like their their meat milk eggs and cheese and they eat a lot of it\nAnd then quickly here Laurie I'm I was like this number two confidence in farmers remains very very high despite what others at times would like us to believe\nRight and that's great and that's where it's always nice to remind farmers to about perspective because it seems like Everytime you pick up the ISI some headlines that something might be negative\nAnd you have to remember that there's an overwhelming majority of Iowans out there who do support would are farmers are working so hard to do day in and day out and we found out in this survey as in the past\nMore than nine and ten they place trust and farmers\nNine and ten nine and ten say they're confident farmers are caring for their animals responsibly and that hasn't changed for since last year and the same thing and nearly three and four states they feel that farmers are caring for the environment responsibly\nAnd are taking on the challenge of improving water quality yeah that one right that sixty six percent so\nYou know when they like to see they like to hear more about what farmers are doing they like to meet farmers and hear their stories and that's one of those things that I certainly keep working really hard at we all do and encouraging folks to do just that\nWell a glory whereas appreciate the numbers are fascinating and the banks are making a few moments for us to share them with us\nWell thanks for the call always happy\nWhere did you guys you to Iowa Farm Bureau I've got some of the specific numbers ready to go out on the big show
