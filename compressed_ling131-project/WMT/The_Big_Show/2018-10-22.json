gave me an opportunity to move a little closer to home so I can but my dad and my brother on the\n[laughter] they're like in the located now Megan [laughter]\nMy offices stories and I covered county in central Iowa\nOkay so you are mine are grown and missed All right all the way a good thing you didn't tell her that beforehand [laughter] [laughter] well\nI Know you've been in some conversations that are that we've been having with the Charlie Herbert Steve Johnson another Iowa State folks about these uh damaged soybeans you've kind of seeing the crop production this season from a couple of different angles as we mentioned so what are your audio wrap this all up her summarize it so far\nA very easy for me the name of the game I mean it it's like that every season this year especially with the\nHard way that it it's gone it's just incredible all I've been doing a lot of different co op around my new area it up and introduced myself and\nYou know it provides a great opportunity to say how have the grain ... coming in and you know every everybody's got a different answer [laughter]\nUh yeah what you'll swings in some cases and in court of what forty to fifty bushel and soybeans ten to Fifteen or just incredibly high numbers\nYou know for the most part I'm here means or doing you know as well or maybe even better its previous years kind\nOf across the board now that you know we're finally getting back to harvest quality navy at CERN more than ... self or a you know keeping keeping that grains dry\nAnd making sure that\nIt doesn't have too many split search you much mold or anything in it they're when they're taking it market that's a a bigger concern but yet but we'll be all over the place\nAre you hearing anything a significant change in their quality issues that you folks have been talking about with Charlie and so forth and I know you\nYeah you guys have talked to said Charlie and seeds and I think the way things are a bigger concern in general from what I've seen so far a corn at this point\nAh and I don't know what exactly the factors are that are controlling it whether it's stuff that was just you know mostly in the ... early whether\nIt's stuff that was in a low lying ground that what I had a little more moisture little more humidity here when they were getting let 'em but the the being quality is all over the board and so I'm hearing damage as high as maybe even twelve percent in some cases\nComing out of certain load there are certain\nAnd then I didn't hear a lot of cases where people aren't you worried about it though\nCastle talk with us earlier this morning and Meghan he was saying some of the early soybeans early being the last week or so were coming out kind of wet but now they're after the dry weather up there and they're ... they're almost too dry or you seen something similar in central Iowa\nI Am they were hanging out in that like sixteen to Eighteen percent moisture and now we've had in real life and dishes and things that got down to kind of Thirteen or so by that you\nKnow mid to late afternoon on friday and I can't imagine that they've they've either stay consistent are only got drier from their afternoon I'm over the past few days\nWhat are they what are they doing with those damage soybeans the collapse taken 'em or reject them or would it be seen\nI have not heard of anybody or acting anything yet it's just a matter of uh what kind of get stuck there might be on ah some of the higher damage and I my understanding is has\nTo be graded by kind of an official USDA greater because typically\nThe visual effects may even when you look at the grain you know you think it looks a lot worse than it is which is good news um as long as he ended up maybe down in the one to four percent damage or something like that you know when we get up\nTo high I heard and a half percent somewhere and I don't know if that was a visual grading or that was just some visual estimate a but but that's pretty high\nYeah they are not what you wanted to think about it especially after um what we were bracing for thinking about might be record yields in some cases compared to last year Megan what do you what are you hearing\nI I I think being you know they're not too far off last year but definitely anything that was a church and what's left in the field throughout this spring fall you know when you show up to a field and you can see soybeans sticking out of ...\n... and ... you know you know you're leaving more out there then you could at least you would have been out there you know two maybe three weeks earlier so\nKind of an unfortunate situation with all that rain all and I knew it was going to happen and I kept saying you know we keep hoping for rain all and then of course it's going to come right in the middle of harvest don't we don't eat it and figures that that happened\nYou know the one thing it's another well good luck out there in the central Iowa particularly dealing with Doug a
