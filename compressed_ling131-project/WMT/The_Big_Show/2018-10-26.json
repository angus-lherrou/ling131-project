I Would think that they would allow all the people who got tickets to get in because of it being a young people are event and they all get tickets uh that's what I Would unless you know maybe I'm wrong but that's what I Would\nWell maybe that's what they ended up doing was uh when they were out of room at the event they stopped giving out yeah so anyway it's just a fun little fact there Bob has plenty more reports wars courtesy of the folks at Sinclair tractors would go throughout the course of the show we're going to give you\nA pull back the curtain a little bit of some of the management conversations that are going on or as we speak in addition to harvest and as they revolve around water quality if they were all around us soil health because you're wondering how this goes out on the farm this time of year I'm Will ah will have one of those things after the results of our\nWater quality trial that we harvest it a couple of weeks ago\nAnd will analyze the markets here you've got to Garret toy ready to go and take credit\nIt'd be a higher prices [laughter]\nI'm not going to ask him to do that but I can say welcome to the microphone your toy always good to visit with you good morning and um well you know yesterday the markets were down as much as they are up today is is going to be a pattern for a while\n[noise] well I mean you have some other you know last week when we spoke we talked about um you know option expiration and I think that you know some of its at play here um you know we're we're we we created the weekly loaded down a three sixty two and the corn and and here we are knocking on you know three Seventy store again\nUm you know I did a three sixty nine and a half so a seven and a half or seven and three quarters and move higher here today\nAll surprisingly we're right in the throes of harvests even though it was probably a bigger bean week for harvest was concerned\nYou know I think you know if we close where we're at right now will probably be a penny on corn for the week\nUm you know being with your up five cents you know I have eight fifty again round number of an expiration\nUm will still probably if we call these levels be oh about a dime lower on the week so I'm you know the big you know sell off yesterday it's concerning you know we have the dollar string you had the outside market weakness\nUm you know we had poor exports again yesterday as the poor exports and corn more concerning or or unexpected per se than than say the swimming export business\nUm you know I I don't think and I think I Want to kind of um you know regress to the the idea that on purpose [laughter] I think probably like I say much for being there for business for the timing\nWell we've been hearing speculation that a lot of folks are thinking at the USDA's yield numbers are incorrect well they were done a there's the the measurements were taken in late September as of the first of October I Would think that that's probably true but I Would think a lot of that's already in the market\nYeah I think you know I I think um I think still have a a an idea\nThat they probably still going to probably come down and corn and come down

T.\n[noise]\nThe thing\nThat have a big show Roger you buy a pioneer with us from the word go at twelve thirty six on a friday on the big show [noise] harvest\nTime here I was ready to run for pioneered\nA lot of talk about uh what are we doing ... fear out to a nice a wet muddy field to get the harvest operation underway and finished\nYeah you know it's kind of a catch twenty two we need to get the crap out it's ready to come out and we need to do that in order to capture all the bushels possible but we are doing some damage to our soil in regards to compare actions so there's a few things we probably ought to think about Israel harvesting\nNumber one I Would curious little load as possible with both your combine and your grand Kurt do more often if you can in order to a whole ... pounds across the soil so easily tactic right now\nAnd the second thing is I Would limit the distance that we travel with the carts and make sure that we're dumping on the way back to the truck instead of going away from the truck and that can help out of that as well\nIs there anything that could be done tillage wives later to try and fix this er which open I guess for a long cold winter with a lot of freezing and thawing\nWell the thing I Would say on Georgia's just make sure we're capturing the goals and the goals would be to eliminate compassion and corporate Roosevelt set ourselves up for next planting season so if it's really wet and we're not accomplishing that all of a breaking up compassion and maybe even causing more\nUh we might want to think about retraining in those situations so that we don't do more harm than good\nHarvest update with pioneers Nick Hansen today on the big show and we'll go from that speaking of harvest you I'm giving you a little bit of a look behind the curtain if you will some of the management conversations that are taking place now as yeah harvest continues buy fertilizer application decisions have to be made because that process takes place\nAs soon as harvest is complete and a lot of cases\nAnd the bigger yields it takes more time in more in depth discussion so here's what one of these looks like after our water quality trials march cycle Kevin boating center both here for ... and I guess first mark are allies forced the data and the the trial results as you\nSee I for one and do you guys had some fantastic yields out there you know uh and which relates back to the weather the weather place a bigger part of it than any of the inputs so we put in and um you you guys had a good weather all summer entirely rains plentiful moisture from washer which\nGood organic matter in the soil and a ... you had a lot of mineral association of the nutrients to help the crop perform well\nSo talk through that men realization thing just a little bit here because you can't see it right well what's what's taking place is the the plants from past years break down and if they do so they produce fertilizer\nAbsolutely and that's why you have got a good organic matter in your soil you've been ... until these practices for a number of years [laughter] and you're seeing a that happened when you get the time we rains the soil microbial population is is basically\nUsing the organic matter from previous scraps and ended up breaking it down for liberalization through minerals ... for nutrients that are available for this year's crop\nWhich may be higher than say the average in the state because of the conservation practices yeah Kevin ... we're we're also seeing is veal of about two eighty both in the checks and the whole field average on about two hundred and ten total units and nitrogen so that's a point seven pound of nitrogen per bushel basis\nThat's pretty good but it may speak to the fact that there's more there's been a realization going on and maybe a way to dissipate is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Show", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "26"}
