I saw the last one I saw operating and I have seen them up right here in Iowa but I was up in Wisconsin here a late last year but this time I guess that the crop came out last year\nAnd they had a drag line coming out of a dairy facility up there but ... but what he's talking about is ... ... they dip a hose right there\nIn the manure pit and then a poll that was the pump a pipe and it goes right out to a line that attract are hooked up to and uh then injects that manure behind it and drag and and they drag that line long there with them then or to the field but I ...\nI've seen that pumped up I Believe longest one I saw was seven miles that took to want to force it took three pumping stations to get a a\nR texture is just um chimed in a little bit more come out for a ride Bob two

going to have him back and Everytime I step on a farm this year it's been raining\nA so hey Jim let's let's move into some uh areas do want to discuss with you in his you know spending time with is you're doing now in the bottom of the hour but we've been talking about a lot of these trade deals that are getting hammered out\nYou've talked about this Taiwan soybean a sale and we've talked about that new south American a trade deal course\nTrade deal and now this latest one that I Can't remember all the letters for but basically replaces a NAFTA uh what do you think about that are ... are we doing going for\nWell it's nice to have some positive news on trade a because we've had good run of a negative news that's hurt prices and and a lead to some concerns about losing markets\nAnd so I think ah obviously someone more soybeans to Taiwan is positive it's not going to completely replace the market we are not in right now in China\nAnd so I think you know we need to continue to see progress uh I think the the good thing about the uh\nThe new NAFTA does give us a little bit better deal for dairy and Canada but until we get the terrorists that are on right now we're not going to see a we're not going to get back into those markets especially China herbs especially Mexico with dairy and pork right now uh be my two big concerns\nYou know we have a long time [laughter]\nI I say that and and Brian ... a long time we have sixty days I think for this thing takes effect right\n[noise] uh I think I think they've got to get it signed in sixty days and then when it's obviously got to go to Congress for approval\nSo it could take even longer than that so we we could be looking at the first\nYear for we start seeing this this uh this situation changed with Canada and Mexico yeah yeah yeah\nI'm ... the other thing we talk a lot about sea Fifteen here in in the state of Iowa and I think three or four times you've had Jim we've asked the same thing because nothing's really change we hear a lot about a change and don't get me wrong here a lot about changing but we're still waiting for the Z Fifteen summertime sales\nYeah ... starting back in the spring there's been a lot of hinting at it and I think that that led to some hope that maybe even a this summer we would have seen some relief and and uh the ability to sell that uh because we need that we need that certainty so that a\nPetroleum markers and gas stations and convenience stores will take the\nStep of investing in the pumps that will allow to be sold in more places a until until we get that kind of market certainly I don't think we're going to see the investment in the infrastructure that's needed for folks actually the uh most places have that ability to buy the higher blend\nBeth and all the other thing we've got to make sure ah is that the refiners are the waivers that the oil refineries have been getting that have led to the destruction of over two million gallons of demand a\nAnd dust ah impact and the corn market pretty severely we've got to make sure that they shut those off a don't hand them out like candy Halloween the way they have been the last two years because he Fifteen Iran sales that you Fifteen\nA is great that we can buy a higher blend but if we're still handing out those are exemptions to refiners are we won't be actually Blendon the amount of ethanol we want to see in the overall market\nTalking with Jim Gannon here he is a candidate for secretary of agriculture in the state of Iowa Democratic candidate never got to ask you a ... you have all the while these meetings going going on around the countryside people come out and and tell you you know what's on their mind what what are you hearing in the country so it was important to Iowa agriculture\nWell I hear a lot of concern about trade obviously um farm income has been down five of the last six years and so the ability to sell that product overseas a is an important aspect to ah getting farming come back up there\nAnd with what's gone on producers bankers a lot of other folks\nHave expressed concern that there may be a chunk of folks who don't get through the next year or even her you know talk\nState fair a couple of stopped me and said we've got to get profitability back into agriculture we've already had to sell one for him to make the bankers happy or we don't want to have to keep doing that and lose everything so we've got to get the trade situation figure it out worked out and the biofuels a UPA knowing what they've done to a\nDemand for our our products but we've also got to make that investment in research especially at Iowa State so we can be figure out what are the things we can do with what we grow and raise so well here\nAre that will continue to add and build demand so we can get a a good amount of profitability back into our culture so we can convince young people that hey there's a future out here it's not just a really thin margin that you're trying to to fight all the time\nYou know I I've asked this many times of folks are what is the next ... moment for agriculture maybe even I've talked about this as well but I I remember in ... remembers is we used to talk about a corn sweeteners was kind of an a ha moment for for corn and then of course ethanol was an aha moment\nFor corn as well ... diesel might've been the a ha moment for so I mean what do think that next aha moment is going to be for agriculture\nYou know it's hard to say I one of the one of the things that's frustrating about the state having flat lined a investment in research at the egg experimentation at Iowa State for the last five years is that we've heard our ability to figure out some of what that next a hormone that might be\nA when I worked at ... and was on the road with ... we went to a a plant in just outside Madison, Wisconsin\nWhere they were making the uh the green top a defining water bottles of plant based bottles those were thirty percent made with plant at that point in time or you know they're trying to figure out how do we get a hundred percent plant based plastic bottle made but the feedstock that they were using the day we were there were corn cobs\nAnd so if we could figure out okay there's a market for some number of corn cobs you're in and year out to turn into plastic I think that would be something that would be positive for Iowa farmers\nI'll tell you what if you could come up with the way to make plastic disappear after\nIt's used yeah I think you'd be a top of everybody's list because that's that's one of the things we struggle with and that's not inside agriculture by outside agriculture but we talk a lot about that uh what what we're filling up our land and I I Know we're getting off in the weeds here but does and

in session for a big show a Andy standing by going to talk news coming up markets as well but ah right now some inside with their gang from Wiffle joining us today on the big joke\nCharlie lands and Charlie is\nThe district sales manager for our friends from ... hybrids in a daycare Madison and union county so he's right here in South central Iowa\nCharlie let's talk a little bit about what's happening or maybe what hasn't been happening in the corn and bean fields around where you are now you you were telling me before we got started early on uh you maybe got kind of a jump on the harvest season so to talk about some of that early harbors what were you saying\nYeah we had here a few weeks ago I mean the bean store white radio guy is kind of knows it's corn and it was a child and expected and there's a fair amount of corn out you know south of Earl I'm towards winter sets my numbers were planted a fair enough money makers route and now we're just kinda sit and wait for the ground drought again and hope we get back and\nYeah we did have some really hot weather there and I'll tell you what be busted out of the issue and I thought were going to be done with harvest by November first we're going to be packing things up and then the rains came and that kind of is typical of what happened during the summer\nOr to Charlie we were sitting on what I Would have thought would have been maybe the best crop that I'd seen a long time in south central Iowa that up until July first the faucet turned off talk a little bit about your experience with that as well\nYeah that you know middle of June we're sitting here thinking we're setting\nProbably our largest crop ever just started to pollinate and then we got you know the full brunt of the trade show that came through there the last week in June and a lot of green snap across the board and a lot of damage the trees early this kind of ... off and then after that we went through forty four forty five days of no rain at all and excessive heat\nYou know I Want to give you credit for a new term that I'm going to be thrown around here a lot on the big show and that is called managing these micro climates a ... because it's like you say it seems like on one side of the road you get four inches of rain the other side of the road you get nothing\nThat's correct you know it's getting more widespread of these little environment you know you can have a farm work your way from get forest with Iran and four miles south get nothing and it's just kind of a norm anymore\nManaging micro environment issues how 'bout that hey let's get back to business here so uh as far as stock strength stock stand ability ... what are you seeing out there what are you concerned about\nYou know pretty much all this or that risk now I mean we've had a perfect system machine to\nGet these stock or fired up we went through excessive rain early a lot of drought and now and again it's just been a host of different battering of stock her upcoming and I'd definitely encourage everyone to a manager Scott Walker you know we used to have six inches above the ground there's not a whole lot of his weapon stocks and we start
