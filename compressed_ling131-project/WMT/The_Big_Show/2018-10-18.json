I haven't talked you know while the soybean market looks like it's taken a hit again today we uh we got some harvest pressure maybe come into the marketplace\nYou can blame it on our it's pressure but I think the bigger deal is the poor export sales reports morning trade was looking for six hundred thousand tons up on on exports sales\nA we had cancellations or bigger than that although most of those were actually switches to from unknown destination is to know destinations bottom line is nobody would buy and beans last week as they were\nComing up rallying up into that USDA report [noise]\nSo we kinda have a an idea what the supplies are are now coming into harbors really getting a little bit late or adults are we going to start a may maybe see in this market to find a bottom here pretty soon\nWell I think the markets thinks it has a bottom but Henri tested and that's what we're doing right now so far we're okay and that uh we're just pulling away from the upper bowl and

hope we've already plumbed the or the the the the bottom out on this so what's going to have to happen here Allen we want to move this market a little bit higher maybe what what what do you think's going to have to happen here the next few weeks\nWell again I think are the harvest story gets played out if if we can form losses and we definitely have some there's plenty of horror stories out there about chatter Lawson\nMulti beans and sprawling beans and what have you that you should see some you lost sight of that USDA won't be able to confirm that 'til the November crop report

tomorrow\nAnd then uh also on Tuesday we have the big secretary of agriculture foreign being brought to buy a Iowa corn back out in the field now with Andy\nAnd we're harvest reporting today Roger you by her friends have poets and Iowa steel masters jumped into the combined here with my dad as we do the field um water quality data today but just in general impressions of harvest season so far have you been impressed surprised or what do you make of it yes I'm\nSurprised at the yields that we're getting and corn and soybeans both I was very worried with all the rain that we had in August and September there we would not get enough sunshine uh to to put all that water to good use but a yields are even better than last year um\nAnd of course it's more variable from field to field depend on how well drained they are [noise]\nThink back to different falls a wet falls nothing new but the amount of rainfall that we have had in the past month is near record at least as this one then more challenging from that perspective um\nOr we'd been before what do you make of that\nOr I have no memory of any fall prior\nUh where we've had rain of biblical home port proportions like we've had this year I think we've had about twenty inches of rain in the last two months um then it it certainly American person challenges out here are very the combine a couple of days ago I had to get a cat out to pull it out [noise]\nUh so yeah you kind of got to pick and choose and there's some spots that are going to get left and hopefully it says like this for another month metal dry out and we can go back and get those spots before it freezes up\nYou have to adjust and they're putting in our request right now for um harvest the weather for the next month or so if it does it dry up then what do you do you have to wait until it freezes is that the deal\nI I think that's about you know whoa whoa whoa wait until the end of the\nHarvest season um and then we'll go back and maybe you know try to get as much as we can of those spots that we left\nUm but yeah probably gonna have to wait until what a first part mid December who knows what the weather's going to do but we'll have to wait until the ground freezes up to get the rest of those spots\nWhich could be a while maybe not depending on again what Mother Nature decides to throw at it so then what do you do from a compassion standpoint to address that are just hope for a cold winter and with all this water reasons or a few times and let Mother Nature take care of it\n[noise] well yeah since since we're no till I'm In a no till system um you know the compassion and we create in the cornfield I'm certainly something that we don't like to see it all or we do have ways to address that we do have a\nAn enlightened deep river ah that we could go out and do some ripping on probably will go out and do some ripping especially on some high traffic area and so on but\nThe ground is is what is it is I don't know how much good that's actually going to do is so a meal for thirty days from now all probably have a lot better handle on what we may want to do [noise]\nAnd then are a little water quality test year with the folks from religion with the nitrogen stabilize or\nThe numbers that Andrew pulled from earlier in this very well run around July showed more nitrogen there in the soil which means less run off and in the form usable of the plant so that this was another one of these initiatives that farmers have engaged in to try and take care of the environment absolutely\nUm you know if we can uh if we can put on less nitrogen produce the same amount of corn\nUm and uh you know have that nitrogen available longer for the crop to utilize it in the form that it needs to be in 'em and and you know improve water quality\nUm get the same crop with less nitrogen or maybe even more crop with the same amount of nitrogen I'm about that's a win win for everybody because uh you know water water quality is a big issue I don't care if you're a farmer or if you're if you live in town or in the big city water quality is a big issue for everybody\nI was looking at the numbers a little earlier we put all this data together and the\nTown of nitrogen for Bush over these hills on this field is about point six which is extremely low considerations to people at one point to and then\nThey back that a lot of research and technology has helped but that is an incredibly efficient number my dad guys we're down to the farm in southeastern Jones county harvesting our water quality trials and getting on the field

on the field and he's been out there all day he is in the middle of a sound like a pretty ah good corn crop going on in uh east central Iowa this morning\nProbably doing Scott linings today southeastern Jones county on the horror home farm and this was a the site when we gathered back in early may so June July August September October five five and a half months or so ago to uh to begin this process and\nThere was an end today it's just the next step the data analysis of course we're all done\nBut um it's a little water quality testing it say Niger to stabilize or effectiveness test as it was applied and strips finishers fearing for producing\nA one plant or pass so sometimes you just put on what the plant or a had a\nA stable either in a producer scared at the next one did not so it's a true side by side it's the same high bread and same growing conditions same exact field and that will get some numbers several scale ticket numbers in the old monitor data Kevin vote centers year mark cycle is here as well as for D.C of life sciences and uh\nThis is kind of what it's all about isn't it mark are reaping the benefits of what we've shown\nAbsolutely this is the time all farmers look forward to and to see what they have ah reap the harvest you know get the get the benefits\nNow you're a little further south which or give us a harvest progress up there I guess in your area\nOh actually I went over to uh Bloomington, Illinois for a meeting or earlier this week and I would say Ninety percent of the harvest isn't in central Illinois western Illinois ah we I'd say we're probably sixty percent then and the further north I came today the less I saw harvest it so\nKevin ... got the northern territory into irritating me whether your dad's just barely getting going up\nThey're north of highly twenty\nYeah here just last week guys are really just kind of getting out and getting going they're still having to pick out the spots to stay away from that you don't get stuck but really on Monday was the first day here in a long time that combines and been able to roll and saw one guy out doing some beans yesterday\nYeah there were some switch over is taking place yesterday I've been hearing about some pretty what means but ah anyway as far as this trial goes we're looking at what the nutrition fear and Kevin and how much more effective that makes the nitrogen purchased in terms of ...\nSo ... is probably one of them aside from the sea ... one of your biggest investments in your ... in ... new just fear products were protecting the from loss in three from three forms a loss for protection from ... convergence ammonium\nFor protection from Niger vacation or conversion to nitrate and also the conversion are the dean education to nitrogen oxide where gases off there so above below ground protection first try and protect to have investments and put it into the plants and out into the water ...\nYeah we were out here I'm In August and mark after a Andrew Gilbert ... corrupt took some soil samples and it showed that there was more nitrogen that was in the usable form available on the strips that had an interest in didn't now I guess we're looking for yield\nAnd that's typically what we see is more of the in age for the ammonium and that's what the new to fear does is keep that applied nitrogen in the ammonium form all the way through Greenville and that's real important to help or the plant to utilize that nitrogen when it's a filling the are\nFilling the ear filling the colonel make it it'd be for heavier colonel for higher test weights typically a and\nA and a good deal of currently we see\nYou you were talking about a a deeper colonel and a heavier colonel it's incredible to do the uh the ear counts in terms of size and links and throw it into a traditional calculator and they're coming out way low\nUh as far as the the predictions are much less than weren't the actual you'll that we're seeing yeah it's hard to take it you know I guess when you're out there pulling\nA year a year or two of you know randomly through the field but the real test as the combine and the way in the wagons making sure we get the healed out there that we expect\nField has been so far phenomenal in this part of the state you a little bit further south uh and they were\nA little bit on the drier side and you know a little bit further north into quite a bit of rain but so far it's it'll be hard to draw any conclusions here to day you're looking anecdotally up at the monitor from time to time we'll gather the data but so far to Seventy two Seventy five which is amazing\nThat is amazing even down in southeast Iowa where it was dry those guys you're surprised that the the typical off with no more rain than they got down there\nThe yield increases been substantial over the past three or four years of that curve I guess and and you talk about what ... that's got to do with some of these supplant health technologies that you're developing\nRight and those are the takeoff technology the a veil nutritious fear of being able to utilize the nutrients that we put out there [noise] get more efficient we just got to get a little better doing what we're doing and protecting the nitrogen from all three fourths of the laws like Gavin that\nKeeping the phosphorus from getting tied up in the soil keeping that more plant available so we put out there more that gets in the plant and then utilizing the takeoff technology to work in the plant to get more of all nutrients especially nitrogen back into play and utilize it more efficiently\nAll of these are quote unquote management decisions that take time Kevin maybe start a little bit earlier like now thinking about next year but are are hard to argue with the results that they're they're not worth it\nOr see some incredible results on and that's exciting term bought this year with all the work that we do do and how's that going to pay off or coming out in the field and put the bushels into them so this is money time so let's see our products dead and here's some good results author and essentially give get published\nAbsolutely so I've got some pictures in
