the the US uh all of the parts of the Trans Pacific partnership with\nJapan so a lot of trade announcements ah been impacting this market Don I guess we're still waiting for the big window to come in is not by far biggest trader because Canada\nIs our biggest trading but the waiting for the big ones come out of China right\nYeah you know a good morning I think that's exactly right and what we're doing is at risk premium to the market for\nYou know as we're talking about trade or continue to move in that direction that has more positive than negative of course China's the odd out here so far but I think that was the plan is eventually it kind of squeezed and eventually they come into some kind of a trade alliance but\nYou know let's just look at the month is the Tambor China's a imports of soybeans of all soybeans six point eight million metric tons versus a year ago six point four million metric tons so they really haven't slowed down or buying pace from around the world is just been a dislocated and other traders of picked up ...\nYeah and other traders are picking up our beans too I think um at least we've talked about that right\nYeah oh most definitely I mean that that's what's happened is a a a Brazil and Argentina both have banned by being from the U.S and you know so far this week of course China's on holiday\nBut Brazil has two car goes offered for sale to China\nIn Argentina's April so if you look at it usually about this time of year they're kind of sold out that China's coming to the U.S to buy soybeans so I kind of in a little bit of a vice grip I think China is if they're going to continue their buying ways which\nUm you know you don't change diet that fast so you know I think it's the trade but I think it's also the weather and it's also the

L. as to two hundred two hundred\nCalories a confirmation\nWell there's a big show coming up on twelve Thirteen and we've been talking trade today are caught up earlier this morning with our secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue he's joining us right now\nOn the big show joining us today we're talking trade secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue is with us send a Mr Secretary welcome back to the big show number one\nNumber two we had been talking trade here over the last week and\nA lot of trade deals to talk about big one just yesterday we're all watching in as we heard about the U.S Mexico Canada free trade agreements bring us up to speed on that what it means for agriculture and how it might differ from the old NAFTA agreement\nOil went on to the ... the U.S embassy a new agreement is a great addition for us producers at a certainly from Everest stores or relationship we had with Mexico and even in ashes ocean for biotechnology in a sanitary bottle sanitary purposes but\nIt a better than that it gives us better access to the uh\nThe Canadian market all and dairy and a poultry eggs and soil as our grading issue on the northern plains border so this is good news it ah oh we're happy to have that put back together of the show NAFTA for agriculture and been a\nA view very favorably over the over the years except maybe in the south Florida and Georgia produce section but\nNonetheless people did this go away but I think this validates President Trump's uh ability to get a better deal that's exactly what he's done here and uh we're excited to have it back together\nWell Mr Secretary and we're a corn beans catalog strength so we understand about that now we we understand that there were some hang up the dairy so what changed on on the dairy front\nWell as you probably know and I've heard about the class seven mill Canada has a supply management system which are\nKind of on a quota almost like a peanut system used to be where the dam or rabbi limitation they get very high prices for a class of milk in fact their consumers by over six dollars a gallon for for fluent mil\nSo that consumers are supporting the dairy among at a at a big a big pay\nIn Canada but what happened is they created a two tiered pricing system called class seven or they also allow their producers to produce for the world market\nWhich they dumped on the world market and depressed prices for our people so we knew that had to go if they want to have a supply management system manages supply for Canadian consumers\nAnd don't affect what happens to us on international market that went away we get a better access on some of the cheeses and butters and other dairy products that way so it's an improvement I think again or a it restores many of the things that we had\nAn improved dairy poultry egg access and a\nGives us a quick let's see I'm grading on we are in the northern plains\nNot talk about a police for just a moment the time schedule now we understand there's a sixty date period there were going to be going through here before this actually takes effect\nThere will be it will be a it has to be announced the Congress signed and then announced the Congress that Congress obviously\nHas to approve of the agreement and I'm I'm optimistic I was surprised there was that much concern about Congress approving or not approving a can't imagine anyone in farm country not approving this agreement it's better than will add\nIn the original NAFTA is President Trump promised the only reason I can think that anyone wouldn't vote for this from an egg perspective is that uh they just to make a political decision they don't want to support anything President Trump does\nNow President Trump or in his remarks when he was talking about this yesterday I talked about senator Joni Ernst and the crowd and said he was coming to Iowa City had a big announcement to make every one of the state thinks he's going to be talking about east if team you got any insight on that\nWell I sure hope so we're going to be pulling for that and uh\nWe've been talking to the president about the need for a year ratty Fifteen for months now and I think others have been talking to him so I'm hoping we don't want to presume that but uh because we've had so many fits and starts about that but I ...\nI'm hoping that we can expect an announcement very soon about eight Fifteen\nHow about an announcement sued about a trade with China what what can you tell us\nAgain I think China is up to China what the president has done is called out China for their own unfair trade practices and agriculture from a protectionist standpoint\nBut also cheating on the world stage regarding intellectual property theft forced transfer and those kind of like China stated strategy is to overtake the United states economically and the growth high tech industries are the future including agriculture\nAnd a President Trump has been the first one to call them out on that\nThe great thing is is that farmers understand that chat I hadn't been playing fair that China has a a kept our products out in many places and ... other barriers to a non ... type of barriers\nTo our products over biotech products and other things like that\nAnd we were simply asked China the play fair and uh we could stop all these terrorists that China just agreed to play fair and to end up by by WTO and worldwide or\nFree trade agreements and that's the issue so I don't know we we're going\nIn the domino effect way data right course renewal it was good for American agriculture we've got now the U.S MCA or a new NAFTA and we're having a productive discussions with Japan\nAnd we're all we can again the discussion really which also has some ... trade barriers that we need to take away from her adoptions protectionist standpoint so and then hopefully China can come along and realize that President Trump is serious about protecting American Jobs were attacking American farmers\nMr Secretary thanks for joining us today and a big show\nIn any way you look for it I mean when you yeah\nYou bet a twelve twenty now on the big show clock a secretary of agriculture
