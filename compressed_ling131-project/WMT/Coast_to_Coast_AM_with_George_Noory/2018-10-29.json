on that [laughter]\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are in our financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance there\nSo if they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nAnd I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have term in life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou

stories in the book the monster a monster book um and and some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man is the story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so now the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a ... and\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seems everything in its brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post\nAnd somebody it's saying this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better way to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of the name and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have the spy\nToo weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog man and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI tell people if I don't have on says I'll tell them\nYou know they should they should just say real or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon but you know [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that gold that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ...\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Canfield [noise] um he saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but\nIt was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the\nSo to see them yeah well I've got to be honest with you Joe ... up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say the vast majority of older report so I get don't send anything like you know they step head of the Pentagon the CIA or the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the concept in the movies ... described as looking ... you know go on and skin is why\nWhy why um [noise] um people talk about I actually have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them even talked about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after a propane using wager boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe fish but many black mistreat it fall beyond you know just guys in black suits\nWalk and I guess I'm you know I'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a tuition is you know you've got a really weird and actually a couple and then some which are age here apps to explain there is a parallel with demanding black but you know but in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies all responsible for the paper I think it's a very small gotcha gray versus the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this is the\nOver the years agencies may actually unemployed the elections are demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might be able to think of them and know that many black hole to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the legend the most have as a means to\nTo ... and quiet people who may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know how many black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nOr whether or not you believe the alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or

George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm ... by the FBI that yes like ... ... ... aliens\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey now\nIn the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft where they really strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused cold day a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so they should have direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to bitch strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that\nHas the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then when you\nThe allies that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and winter Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government use really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George\n... is a first book flying saucers of landed published in the early fifties that that sold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt\nI'm On a ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ...\nBucks the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\nJoined the coast to coast am pleased with the with thousands of

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences peak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um it came out of\nAn earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the Syrian citizen and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning um and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or even increased that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real buff sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence\nOf participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to ignore me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nHer for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and high\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes\nTalk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about this but\nSome other people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension and face that's different from the other three so\nYou know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length if you then draw flat where on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions that has links and with and then you could you could\nDraw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube and your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nWay back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nFind that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you\nStill have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members every audience of her string theory\n\nDefined were George Norris speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com

because it's sort of flows from what the Robby was singing about in that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people\nOf a false picture of the universe and our destiny\nHaving lost religion and gained nothing at his place\nToo many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are profiled in the book who struggle with is the uh apparent contradiction between spirituality and science I'm ready to get into a couple of

second\nWendy [noise]\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher right now one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with this\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and\nExcuse me and\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about um you know the existence of other spiritual up\nLevels are worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think as his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience numbers come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than ... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the audio what how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing and we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books\nHe's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm done and\nAll of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYou're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on\n'em so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nThe dreaming self he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening somehow the dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and you could we could talk about that as as as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one of the state capital\nThe journal by the bed of their dreams and a couple of recommendations for how to do a dream journal you believe that everyone it would be able to see that all of our dreams contained future events and then I'm sort of mixed up together [noise] well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there\nGoing to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science as a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas
