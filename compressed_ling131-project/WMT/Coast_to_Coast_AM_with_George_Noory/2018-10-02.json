{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "And let the fat sixty five sixty seven eighty or the year and it's kind of a ... second day when I say it's five thousand\nWell there you go you're under funding it automatically them so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit definitely thanks thanks appreciate the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll are you better than I deserve what's up\nGay so we have just recently paid off her house and the U.S so we are completely debt free and I\nJust wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay hey so we live in a two bedroom town that was pretty tight we have a family of four and a one on the way\nMhm so we\nWere okay here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about than pay cash for a large good\n... so\nMy income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she is on liquor is really really isn't making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't eat no okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income what your town ALS worth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she in a hundred and sixty thousand and it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars for how long has it gone tricky to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am quoting away the Fifteen Percent a month long ... long my employer nachos four percent ...\nSo we we have the Nineteen percent there that's going Ninety percent of my income that's going to retire ... my question is would it make sense to go back to three baby step three D. no and no you know\nWhat a what is your age uh I'm thirty and my wife is twenty nine okay\nWell you got plenty of time you're going to be OK I'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income going to go up and the value of your town house is going to go up or slow value what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it's you and you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would say at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though it in the house fun\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars\nA year that in three years and some change you'd\nHave another hundred thousand but with this town house you'd almost be there\nSo I think your three I think you've got a three year plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to be tied it'll be a tight budget to do that but you ... not going to get back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into that either you're smart man\nCindy's immobile Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh Mobile Alabama I Would\nThink so I'm looking at Kelly on where are you from woman okay how can I help\nWell we're new to the financial police University We're entering our third rake and my husband is the fiduciary for his brother who passed away he was out one hundred percent disabled veteran and he left quite a large state\nMy husband has an attorney immobile who is I'm taking it to the court at least to six months and then it'll be distributed and um my husband I'm just concerned that the Veterans Administration will come around and\nOr maybe three years from now and say no we need that money back because it wasn't used for Mike I'm and I don't\nKnow ... money that came from the VA is right in the huge state\nYeah so they gave him a lump sum due to his disability\nNo he was one hundred percent disabled in every month he was the money and the Veterans Administration and I had been paid all his\nCare bills and everything like that mhm but because Mike would give it away on the first day he got it the Veterans Administration kept bringing a family member to walk over his state and some might have been doing that for Twenty years oh my lousy felt the same grade\nNow it's not they're not going to come after that they're not paid paid a disabled veteran for being destroyed and yet a family member managed it well for the good of the veteran who has now passed they they've got no standing whatsoever to come after that okay\nAll right no I I think you're fine is your husband the sole air\nNo no he had written a real with my brother Mike didn't well with my head and help give some to his nieces and then distributed I might just dividing brothers and sisters\nAre so much was the size of the state\nI wandered around that if the I think each of the three scientifically Seventy and eighty five or five six nieces will get\nThousand ... I'm not really sure there's often go coins\nYou know your husband is a good man and he\nWas he was very much and we ended up taking like all his veteran diminished pointing at the last year but because of the a\n... care but not ... unless my cat are represented there because that's what happened to him we miss him now that I'm back in the money\nYou know definitely definitely but your husband took good care of it and that's what I'm saying\nYeah we like it because we are was there that we're going to get there because we have an extra piece university honors got\nSeventy thousand dollar jumpstart now so life is good\nSunny thank you for calling and appreciate you taking care of it open phones at triple eight eight to five ... five two to five you jump in and we'll talk about your life and your money\nIt's common sense for your dollars and cents they can you please explain the difference between Ross four one K. and ... regarding limits taxes et cetera can you have both you can have both those the fifty five hundred a year limits still apply it applies to the ... you can fully fund I Ross\nIRA and a raw four one K. in the same year fifty five hundred dollar limit\nFor your ah Ross higher re unless you're over age fifty then you have a sixty five hundred dollar limit your maximum for four one K. is er Eighteen thousand five hundred\nOr that you can put into a four one Kay plus whatever your company match is if they do they cannot match and they can you you can put in in Iraq the match will be in a traditional and you can roll that to a Robin pay taxes on it the matching portion if there is a matching portion so uh\nThey're excellent they grow tax free all of the above we always suggest you put it in good mutual funds across four types growth growth in income aggressive growth and international always pick mutual funds with long track records that about performed the ash and the and the to exist lots of them\nThat ... this hour of the day for him to show\n[noise]\nAnd then\nPlay production officer for the show and here's a little tip for two thousand and Eighteen go download our revamp Dave Ramsey show apple app store\nWe listening to your feedback in ... new features to make it even better check it out\n[noise]\nHey folks let's talk about finding the ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trend aboard year after year\nWhile this can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors on an open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into is the process is not approached with expertise and caution\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours\nThis is why it's crucial to have a real estate professional guiding you through the process who's on your team\nOur endorse local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder or E.

Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nThat as a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science ... in general the next year or so uh by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is in ... and it's a ... I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of in a year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well as one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know have the media is always there there there are amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it with people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising\nAnd the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the charge because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work more why does astrology war\nBecause here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing\nUnder age which is what the old idea exactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nEverything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the look of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that is really taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath where we're seeing it gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various plan if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscopes and then you can attempt to interpret what does\nThat say about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate yeah are you\nWell\nLook I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually months ten year I could do anything\nFor that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it your noon is at sunset is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because the twenty four hours most the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing and which is sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd ah and telling me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah in this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there when it happened twenty two when I got to do the other is on the nuclear at Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the coast to coast day

astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I okay it took me one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner\nGeorge grungy of a a ... ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Rhodes who are who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics so on\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there of the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was in I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading his books if you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated was in the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince you since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going to medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic weird thing\nThat you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of the chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people that studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThe world went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who is a science was taught in the universities of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome ... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears bombs burn the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay worn out one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born well\nThat helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty\nQuick in and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nGood luck on the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I ... you know two great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date for your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say uh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to her first quarter moon I'm\nOld as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so within areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful and this and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun a Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nYou have a question to\nUh yeah I'm not healthy now well if you're not held on now\nAgain you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey there's\nA whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic Lee people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else so that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOr incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun ... and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman that being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me ...\nItaly in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime of Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine hundred thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried we're stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages\nFrom the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years so it kind of deep seated study\nAnd uh trading into some kind of mystery is or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car load next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for food\nYeah All right thank you a question about Korea money and should I moved to a different state I'm a toy or vote in a quiet city court\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way of course in he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or no oh no okay no problem okay you said money\nAnd where what state to live in which they deliver you Jim Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even in my Web site it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of Monday and astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California enter the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you if mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationary in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you're mysteries in its home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about mercury a treasure grades the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle\nWhich is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half and therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids that little plants like higher on\nThe truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\nSuper mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve and New Year's day to get

I walked out into the there was a long half mile here\nAll of them from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the production early meets the Chesapeake Bay and I was sitting there late at night when I saw a larger delight heading toward me\nThat was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large dissed shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany rows straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music when\nI saw a large white light hovering over a barn and a few minutes later began linking on and off and following my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's island\nThan stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later he started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared on one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times then stop and then suddenly I saw brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and
