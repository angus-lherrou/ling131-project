uh the\nUh uh you know ... ... you're not\nMaking a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five on and so my gripe one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know hardly making anything on that and you're in gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year ... lose money on that how it would be able to three months vacancy if the markets offered up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay forty\nSo I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of your head and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know it will start working these by bishops the right way\nAnd following on Peru and getting the emerging them cheap on

Francisco Hi Mike how are ya\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my starter said so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby stuff on um the first time I'm doing a budget and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar\nOkay and they're all going in ... well\nI just feel like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just storm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell the you're just takes a little while to get things are just at the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong but more in there\nYeah but you always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I bet people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going you know there's just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invest in the financial peace university um or should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in there for them\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you want to hold on just give it to you and

great up I made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done other one horn than this one is definitely the easiest is or\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your realities that's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know and it just takes a month and then the next month to get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate it'll take about\nThe rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and then I got this one bounty on you

appreciate it\n[noise] so returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago a when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar and counter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven so\nI started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the hoop of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down from doors for me I'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nA\nProtector annual stone soup

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones\nFound ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found and that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit\nBecause the writers who have no familiar to you but the topic of

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not the ... will be tall but covered with hair and they were just plan to playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that\nHunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things doing an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did\nAnd since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this uh Dave there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it than say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nWe'll open up the phone lines are with your calls the questions or comments white flag into the break your all coast to coast they\nLeave 'em\nFind out more about it I guess log onto coast to coast am dot com news radio sticks on [noise]\nThat when you weigh machine in\nThey\n\nAlways keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.

minute\nNow think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the Patterson film is real\nWhy haven't we caught despite that on film in that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay

the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nTo be here thanks dark\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw\nUm I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk and\nAdd to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I sat out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved was I had actually\nBeen praying I'm I pray that my work\nAnd I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for work histories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm\nIn being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render this story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part many theories and she fits that two major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand for others\nBut we only face mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need the right stuff while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so your family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several months\nWe finally met and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of African our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of

I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm\nMeaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more sorts that he published after the war he first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from commend her how she met his point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology and Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around Bain on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarine because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realized things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould others stand on them there's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs like oh there's mood I'll just reach knowing grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young ... and by the name of John Ralston he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippine see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a\nSixteen wraps between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so\nAny water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know the second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason so some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take small for it is that the sea water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels burst\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight and all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess immediately that it did some that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have service to finish them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nAnd by the name of Richard With friends and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general with them and you know that the general death in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see the kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's no report coming in saying that there isn't any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is true or something of that nature but yeah I guess the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of time\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing recorded in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they had a son\nWho you know the gentleman richer Francis have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and we're at the one father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the

Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of drop through the cracks that made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um departure message that didn't go\nThrough from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines I who had received the next thing that is\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrive of that and shit I guess that means I don't have to report on Iran will be there\nAnd then you know can be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signal combine to make it in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one ensure a bomber pilot it by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors find it in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they've dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these guys in the water or something they hang on to and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left an airplane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for our ship for the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and that was the burden they carry till the end of their life\nYou know it's war time as we said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um it was a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but or is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day uh then well reporters\nAre reporting on it the ...
