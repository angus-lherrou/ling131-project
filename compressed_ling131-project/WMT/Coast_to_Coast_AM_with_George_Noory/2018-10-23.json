Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up with the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into\nThe health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked double or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question go talk to you Annette thank you for calling in Dennis is with us Dennis is in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nI'm well your shelter\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well um my wife and I started your program back in June and um we've been working our way through where they just have to um we have some whole life life insurance policies um each of our parents took old\nWhite from church on us when we were younger we still have those policies and the more we got married we each took out a policy\nFor the mole life um the cash value on the policies is about eleven thousand dollars mhm and we're wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into our that's noble\nAbsolutely\nYeah there are horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has the payday lender in the middle class I mean it just as a\n... a ridiculously low right of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay the the cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is horrendous and uh you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and do your investing anywhere except on in life insurance product and so\nUm that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nWould there be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the loss off but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there is no game now\nYes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand show if you have you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nWhen Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck\nYou don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nUh then I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago de da\nYeah mine should be paid off by the end it this year which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle some on I meant for property that eye on 'em and then after that was good until the\nMarkets and we live and so why planning on saving up for the three to six months of American seemed fine but we're not sure how much we can save ...\nWhere two income family obviously we have no kids on but if both of my tenants leave my rental property fat out the choir like a really different amount that if I have to sell we're trying to figure out how much safer make hats\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals do you know\nI can match oh ...\nI Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and but pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there with the ... in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rental cars what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxable each year\nA because everything else is going to be deducted well all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account to cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that to do it that way and separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right on okay\nAnd then over but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars in these so called a a floor carpet gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers as there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in\nThose particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um [noise] but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy [noise]\nUm but Russia\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise] um and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nGoing to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive fence to think um hold\nOn bribery more at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to

coast to coast Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nUm I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we could not have them do\nThey have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nA less where you hire them to do that well yeah well the\nOne weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the workings tips walk to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know do [noise] and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nUh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block them a a a you know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never\nAnd I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit I'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George Green show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do\nWe really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay\nAll right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nOr nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about the course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the ... is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well\nUm I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nA mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nDoesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster [noise]\nUm no second question profiles people well\nOkay hold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit this Brickell ready school by fast food you Robert you've been with us we'll be back well ah\nLet them finish up your questions there and I don't ... interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had coral F a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to\nWrite well they they captured some of the two so but\nUh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets\nBut they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWas amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now\nDuring those critical time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nBut I I like to see America once again to become\nA country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums just a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first fan\nFirst moved here while they may be the last ... now what\nWe're here well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nAh I'm OK okay the this movie\nSome people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini in Chino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and the spectacular nature of of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them and the sixty saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David in Salem ... said David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George ... thing\nUm okay so um it's interesting to me out what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already my life but do we have any plans are there any theories on\nAustin which can be leading an atmosphere stimulating of life's just learning environment um drilling holes that were released trapped gases are eating the the atmosphere with and we had a horse when he leaves her plans\nFor that what\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because marshals wants a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh\nI Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThe port Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and I just have a question on your thought it'd be leaning towards privatization but are you in Anchorage privatization on mic colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you ... you know government should be some more involved in\nIt hating how a possession of real poverty as it was with us if we ever got to the point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead and rubber minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of ... so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we prove the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments they'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas from would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas\nThat are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and become an example\nTo the rest of humanity Robert thank

Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity in ghostly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work gold ... dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gunshot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist\nUh-huh yeah so it it actually I actually got a day job and then I studied the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was ... at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for the give us an overview of what you've been doing random\n[noise] well um you know I uh I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goats encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with the goes studies\nAnd you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of goes encounters um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews eyewitness accounts\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thoughts I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with a book\nWell then you bring a do some real science to the picture your brand new no I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is\nOut there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm In tangle man and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so\nThere's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded today brand new about what the ghostly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly account or if it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them why did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's um inside is basically um collapse of the\nExtra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of ... counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um collapse of the or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call the uh Calif addict distress signals and sort of how they play a role in grossly encounters\nA so I really think that um people's collapse of the ... is a real it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important than is the person as opposed to the vet or something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty\nFifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst\nTo everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think\nIf we look at a lot of that goes to encounter that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma\nLike that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that right and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distress signal thing ah to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nAs you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nWith Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up at coast to coast am dot com results show on Facebook\nAnd Twitter as well we got those links for you

that\nSort of under special conditions I'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening in that location and maybe the child and the mom\nSaw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even skier due to death\n\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in\nSort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning a new my wife was out of town\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take\nA shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nAnd I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me and went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood\nCat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in their lives you know I still in the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept that asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many pure noble experiences recruit Brendan because the person who died comes back never had some on the news business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know a percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staffs of a father or something\nLike you know\nUm you know you're sort of struggling with death there's always a motion happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of hill this psychological wound through what other whatever means possible\nSo maybe if you're not able to cope through normal man you might use unconventional me you know and if you have collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere [noise] um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so it's a pretty high number eighty percent\nIt's huge yeah yeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm going to come out of it goes and counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to this is not all negative and demons and things like\nA brand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters the mothers what's so special about though\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is\nDifferent about them you know when they put 'em there's there's some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something\nOr yeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing I found out FM our eyes jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting\nTo this electricity at very low levels\nSo there's some sort of objective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can\nYou know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know you know I might get\nPoked with um a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really\nThat it doesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're

I'm Carmen Robert Fox news turkey says it would\n\n\n\nComeback to coast to coast Brandon Mercer low with us we'll get your calls as well as we talk about his work the scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in it than most people will tell me a story [laughter] and\nThey've all got one don't they do\nAnd I was really shocked you know 'cause you gotta sit back and got away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's\nReally been positive you know there's there's still some college you'll come up to go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive um something that's really fascinating and it I mean it's a mystery and intriguing for human you know the dawn of time you know that's\nTrue\nOh ... you know it's not that bizarre or out of context them anything\nAnd listen I mean parents psychology is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology\nIt's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh where I studied as a top twenty five university they're the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lotta people\nWhat's up to that has baffled you ... you don't have the answers were\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um\nHolds her guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know the do humans have the ability to move objects\nIf they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like when the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission was to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre wasn't I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing\nMy accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it illustrates the role of luck with the er sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional chefs related to the process of dying in a in a way sent up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message tell a path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also begs the question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment because obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do well\nOh yeah yeah I mean it's one of the most common themes when it comes to\nParanormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be you know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the lectures that he comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans\nAs well an animal she does ... you know any involvement of\nHumans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go while they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a Pulitzer guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic fields are always present as well\nThis since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is you know any amount of always been linked\nYou know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere's this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes and counters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of for them indicating that a ghost is president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes uh whereas if you have a fluctuating he and my next to a dishwasher or you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\n[laughter] um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with ghostly encountered even when I hear these real life ghost encounter some people will say you know\nUh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the roof fell Energizer like there was it felt like a of electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri things started hey Jay\nMorning George yeah Brian questions or do you believe that you're [noise] [laughter] I ... in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in do we\nDo they hide in ... you\nKnow I I don't think so you know and and and this is obviously just my opinion um there's nobody there definitely prove this but but I don't see ghosts that sort of I'm hanging around all day watching us\nYou know like a TV um I I see the the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times and certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there is some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interactions and where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting it's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth balance spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us and way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them you know it's it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes to come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe got teeth in Rochester
