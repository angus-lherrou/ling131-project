I'm only debt is mortgage I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off a which were about to go at the end it off the U.S pay\n'em even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency expenses that back emergency fund um I've got a four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and my main question is what a extra income every month\nAnd if we should be voted at something that's strictly tied retirement what you see what we have a lot of orange it'd be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like a some type of managed fund it can be accessed prior to retirement if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um\nYeah at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are\nUm how long have you been making that kinda money\nOn the last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess since yeah let's Raj from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nDo yeah good let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses and uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund\nExcept your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children no not right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nWhat it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and doing the British stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order um [noise]\nOnce you're doing that then maybe step father's kids' college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or lamb or reach over knock the house out beyond that which is\nHas the same effect to your net worth that the bridge loan does because I have in your home paid off frees you up in ... to need a lot less income to retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll the old two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty or how she's going to be paid off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent debt free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing and it's our bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to an additional stuff with before then but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no pay much\nTo go with your fabulous income or your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other money that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line

animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise]\nBut they do have are really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I don't want people to think that two sides it right is supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know\nA suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\nSince ... very sad yes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to be on ...\n... ... that's like I said you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel like when you're with in their field is that what you mean George\nYes oh I bet ya impressive so if you're with the president is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nAbsolutely now there are some people who when I called psychic\nVampires but but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get\nKind of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the mumps day in year and then I just didn't want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you run a judge

you happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... tense exchange so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity do you have a question Chris oh I'm\nVery much a creature routine and I just wanted to see if their routines and our break his routine you're boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm a I used to I I Do some writing now\nYes well you have more than ... at the time you were born and that tells me that there are extremely intuitive and you're very caught up with details when you paint you should be painting again that's very therapeutic Chris and that'll bring and wonderful spirit

question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nThey test scores in Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine as their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say there has to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to do like whatever that might be a\n... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy and so on and change your life and try prayer and meditation they know what God I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and something no an spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night bull number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's\nTwenty four seven line so you can call in\nTo the day was got a question for you in Canada and the

cross over to help her before she passed a law was not\nThere three other than your friends or with whom she uh\nShe's very generously had a very good heart and she said thank you for saying that she thinks she thanking your day so you must have been pretty pretty nice to her\nSaying she was the greatest one of the greatest\nI can tell her energy is extraordinary very good heart interests\nKind you could ask for anything she would do anything for anyone but to have you not different from that yourself you very much like that you have a very good hurt yourself and don't create for her she's

dream work with the ancient some Monica mystical practices for your into the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network\nA noted the authors got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back Marc ...\nGood debate dreaming were waving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the receiving a and B psychic media andme of mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned way and she saw it might that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face well she was right that when ... when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in the house bill the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that that is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books\nI must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field are you looking at the the the the scalpel in the ... not\nMoney to be around going down down the beach down to Luna Park a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate want to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do on the ride look up to go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe I'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit back eventually opt to seeming\nTo live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThat there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nLike this person who could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes when nuts so the gift of these experiences with strings Michael dissociation ... ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my fathers and the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nBecoming sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easy right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counseling to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and could help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members or ancestral spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams are wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCan reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you've learned about our connections with drama is playing out now the reality is now the time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience this pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what\nWould we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton on more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells\nIn indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to the sin of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple\nFalse step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes you get some help with the fact that your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it the ... the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch a good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that cut those\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing or not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American called and he's\nSeventeen hundred ...

person I think it's kind of let her get out of south email for credit card again use your identity stay\nBut you know at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and not have the uh when I can\nTell me read paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow would like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting he looks at me and he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in the gravy out this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head ... he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduces whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to something called us to a certain place might even be an age and just sit in the city but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories\nSo even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking for waiting you around the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life\nTo pause and check your attitude check orders play you know when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think those are good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind Matt ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that at the heart of math uh the heart of reality is a dense of consciousness so\nThat there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can record\n... ... what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hit but gosh are my blood is bode again it's all you\nLived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she ... fingers so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the before took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomena pre sentiment or anticipating ... be says but I couldn't possibly report if people can guy was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we know that we know you're not ... you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams and the sense that you are going to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose the dreaming you called a ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do some treatment venture\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream you another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift ... state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the porch off elusive dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look good as the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams himself misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think that dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that\nBehind something that's scaring or worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll

back to coast to coast are dear friend Robert boss back with us as we talk about dreams will get your calls as well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's unfit choices Joe in his dream life\nOh yeah he would do you own your own was inspired by dream I mean he said in memory streams reflection but he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him and dream so here is the man I mean a titan\nOf scholarship and son who is driven all his life by his dream one of the stories in my new book the scariest reality is it do you have to get into the\nOff the life and actually what he might be doing now it's a pretty interesting title but the part of that is in the previous documentation is the human dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake come legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling going off to the nearby village is living in another bowling gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost old fear of death you felt absolutely confident and he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious around his Coby out the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and I actually gives some insight into where how humans mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself to a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the power to the shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this it gives the first time the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because in dreams as you understood we receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams who made travel\nInto the rooms with any or at home ... very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continuous lives and other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and come into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... is a negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price\nOf surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew firsthand about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding but all the things we're talking about some of the greatest matter of you\nWho wasn't young soldiers who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had disputes\nFreud regarded as his ... his ... year old was your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own and writes who made himself is number one study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to anything on dreams from someone who is not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on and dreams rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to humans dreams\nAnd you only had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels and the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is as a floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead ... and Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a\nCousin of narrow understanding and that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and mouth in relation to these things and\nOne of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that bus stop there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet and\nYou avoid stop so scared and confused and\nAnd and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun us and he was going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing up hot so what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's a vote on a long way since he died but that doesn't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious reality the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imagine all realm\nI imagine it around is a space between time I did too that the weather of palaces and schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from a higher level I borrowed the word for word from from the writings of\nSome medieval to feed mistakes who spent a lot of time traveling in these regions what what the eventual realm is about is the idea that the imagination of the human imagination assisted by greater imagination perhaps\nMakes real worlds beyond the physical playing these reel to reel will of course\nInclude desirable afterlife locations they also include places a study education and the negotiation and you knew what you can find out about these things by going that as the story is to just let them offering is a puff of direct experience not just can be done theories\nAre less of a second hand to come I'm offering ways of knowing for yourself whether you have available to you for example a place of healing and instruction initiation in a row and be on the physical so the stories about experiences and that kind of reality which is no less real I Would argue enough as it could well\nLet's take some calls here for you and let's go to a ... again in Madison, Wisconsin welcome to the program ... go ahead\nGeorge I'm I was I'm\nA thinking about talking about this topic uh several times with a several gas but I'm I'm I have a question about recurring dreams versus I'm very and hence dreams 'em and whether they can either pattern or\nYou just maybe ... remember them to

hopefully not but I'm I'm doing some work at my father's place in the north woods and\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one bag light in the middle for on each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away\nUm I Know that I'm going to get hit with either a mess or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made\nAny sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't
