T.\nWho is debt free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off out shortly so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nTrack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right yup\nOkay and um the uh the way I look at that is if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities or what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before\nAnd uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect as if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nThat I buy that if we if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not to clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the housework\nOr if they were about a hundred and ...\n... ... only ... years old with a ... four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind of weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd a ... you know what all else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage did\nYou feel emotional weight\nOr ... I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on that oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years in front of it yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the window that's the way you felt Thirty years our can't stand this I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any ... no\nWait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within you know four or five months be debt free on this whatever it is for six months or whatever it takes\nAnd then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper\nYou are on your way sir so honored to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWill thank you ... today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading lights on for about two years now and that we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans or working on and then we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child and April so say we take your advice\nAnd stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know all that good and I as a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her three month maternity leave um pain free for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem as as Murphy has decided to strike at\nThe last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a with a baby on the way here and another a two month we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so\nMy question is what would you do it in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave and then pay that off or what do we do when somebody do a better than\nOkay well the game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball so by becomes pile up the casualties when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and\nOr what a trip that\nAs long as baby mama come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there is no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so much cash will be got piled up or will you have piled up by ...\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that you're wanting to take the three months off the bond with a baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we are smart about this that set a\nGoal to make sure that now so we have are you got for now until December to continue to say right and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much I'm just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as what we have and Ben ... other than our car payment I Try not you have your back and all that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not really went on your car going much your your car alleys and\nOn and on and on dollars okay well then the four thousand would be your that you pay it all up out of this guy and the bar is set aside enough for her to take some very much so you have the cash you should\nTake guy this is James child producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now carried on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one

... little lady kept showing my little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that the hip possessions or tricked or something some strange way it changed your personality\nOr should I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when you go through with for was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a goat in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the goat was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore\nHouse he says and and uh and I helped you know work on that and I looked at him and I went to my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said fly had nothing to do what do you need an exterminate or not a gold person I says why did you even

to attack her like fire surrounding the ... like in the spirit the spirit\nReally as far as to where we're loser Brooklyn through they couldn't charge him nothing you could still be gr\nGun here to protect your actual fire around ... ... what do you think about the\nWell you know what there's a lot of stuff I don't know about and that sounds like it could be credible I've never experienced it

ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well now as well you might as well get up and move around on others as otherwise it's\nJust a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how now maybe another thirty miles from where we were there and\nUh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires from something\nYeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter bright and\nUp on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right oh\nWell I've known them because I've worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it\nWas just in the places that I attended they know where they took me and I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name police\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I wasn't I offering a word she says are you pray him and I says yeah and she goes we'd better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we had these strange environment on nothing\nWas going to be stronger
