{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card\n[laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to I get so six thousand on down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty\nUh about Fifteen about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're going to put fourteen thousand an emergency fund\nOkay so now you have an emergency phony what ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the couch okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense home so that when you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum okay\nBecause the packages were three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty\nAnd you don't have twenty percent down anymore okay you see how that works\nSo you're giving trucks and loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan\nSo you're construction lender will require a take out letter where you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether truck Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you can go in lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage literature ticking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to go or Joe mortgage or it is taking up and I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago would lock them improve\nWe are in a rising interest rate environment nothing to panic about but it is going up and so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinanced were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see right to come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to lock everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during ... are you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from the and gotten a baby step too good and a cubic citing but I don't want to live that momentum that we've had\nReally toward this debt and and going into baby steps three there's like a few curve balls I guess\nOn that are happening so we want to do three three ... ah my husband is also wanting to go back into school she got a bachelors they get a better paying job that would be maybe step three\nOkay but that's my question would we also want to start a family that we need competitors like baby find because we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund first\nEmergency finished first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you'll really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got ... got health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah the labor and delivery\nNo I'm not sure that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much\nOkay yeah so you could just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way\nSo well right now we're saving for that and and then you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going by goes on emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes it maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know that they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\n... thanks for the call appreciate your joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five cliff is

taking the Ninety for life everyday and wonder what else there has to do to avoid this disease what's happening to what do you\nDeal essential tremors or not genetic or they're or they're actually caused by a nutritional deficiencies in and of course um\nYou get them they can be called or things like Parkinson's disease\nOr the ... and of course in parking disease MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain are randomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors where there was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or essential tremors an matter\nBillionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats no oil so blues no sugar and then you take one healthy brain and heart attack or a hundred pounds of body weight one health advantage heart back for a hundred pounds of body weight\nI'm taking photos everything twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight then you throw in the distrust castles capital D like David ... three of those twice a day per hundred pounds of body weight the ultimate knives and plus a to those twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight that will be two dollars a month to the ultimate nice and plus for a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd then I Need you to eat\nUh let's see here what do you weigh a hundred and Seventy two hundred and Seventy two pounds have eat nine eggs today [noise] and they can be soft ... saw scrambled butter\nI Do want you to eat a stick of butter day and they help you understand that we do have a CD called a stick of butter day keeps the doctor away a stick of butter day keeps the doctor away\nHeritage and listen to that CD many many times and you're just shake your head and say well there was my problem you've been listening to doctors and staying away from cholesterol close or is your best friend\nWhen meeting that butter you want to be eating dairy products that has a have a high fat dairy it was a big study with a hundred and twenty thousand people with like a central tremors and Parkinson's disease\nThey found that they had a deficiency of dairy fat they were eating zero fat yogurt the reading skills drinking skim milk or non dairy coffee creamer is you need the whole day a stick of butter day um and you need drink whole milk\nYou remember my breakfast I remember my breakfast berries strawberries blueberries blackberries brass burns and some whipped cream\nThere you go with whipped cream is the best part [laughter]\nReally yeah because that is that your brain requires maintained so people don't realize that the George Seventy five percent of all very raised brain including human beings and porpoises mistakes in Wales and looming goes and giraffes overt raise Seventy five percent of their brain wages of white matter of the brain which has a hundred percent cholesterol\nYou need that fat okay\nTo censor the egg egg yolks come in days are so important um and so I'm all these things the essential tremors go away Parkinson's goes away hunting and it goes away these are not genetic things or even if everybody in your family's got 'em they're all eat in the same way cooking in the same way of living in the same place\nOff the Boise idaho we go Hasan's with us once you get your question in he's in\nA yeah George ... first time caller but I've been listening to you for like twenty three\nYear old thank you yeah\nLove love your show you got a strange one for you good good friend of mine about five years ago was diagnosed with lymphedema ... which is not lymphoma but that he has not been able to find any\nAny uh help for it at all\nUm his lymph nodes just drained anywhere in the body and the heat swell up like a balloon and just a leading can out of his pours\nI'm there to make matters worse about a year later he was diagnosed with lung cancer stage for which he's gone into remission through um radiation sure which you how old way I'm the only a few\nMoments here how much does he way\nNo how how much is the way he's\nWhite and now he's about three hundred and he's a little over six feet tall and normally about two hundred okay\nSo it's three hundred pounds a heat here at all the bad food fried foods to process means the ... and we brought around oats a he needs to take three healthy brain or heart pastor month three healthy and her passion month because he has a history of this cancer and certainly\nGet him or the um liquid I'm a must be nine a grape seed extract from our nature's Pearl division I want him to have three doses of

including the field and the intention experiment\nIn her latest the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn walking back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we\nJust calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the you hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works it\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ... and we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at ... look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis at home property crime went out went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case and we can share what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make it grow faster\nTo purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to walk into a trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has a good record is that in terms of studies so as they say what really seen it can be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things\nAnd when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow he'll thing the experiments you been working on all boys are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know it's the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive move that generally work rather than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through self off of forty foot structure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt weren't for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group\nTo to do the intention and I'll be in and out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is\nSafe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why me why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because\nDVR volunteers at area high be locations will provide shoppers a list of items we shoulder needs and shoppers to donate an item or two when they finished shopping\nJoined the University of Iowa dance marathon for Cancer Center for their miles in the me five one run on Saturday November twenty seven in the Bronx read more these the liberty to her mother was born means pumpkin patch and the scenery the University of Iowa dance Marable moral guy was gone\nAnd we keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.

help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same it all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else ... when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a mirror of what does that\nMirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers of stuff\nAnd the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intentioned experiments so when\nWe started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion\nBut more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions

George and you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone\nAnd I think there's something about that group support that group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in group they're total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or do or conference call or something like that many of them\nEnd up feeling like this is a badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person and that the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a

sections or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older you know I think that um that people who tend to do this stuff are people who are you know anywhere from their thirties to their seventies\nUm it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know and becoming a mastering tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things too intense for and how to do it but also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think at that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal and it's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that and what they intended for you was that he would find the source of these in these depression\nAnd soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration system wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that we've treated\nHis depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but\nHe ended up going back to his fighting weight he lost weight the it got back to his\nKnow his his weight that he was that the young man\nHe um he chewed gum practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better\nHe got a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life with getting better and even his training you know he's he's um\nHe's a trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously and in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year\nWhen you do these
