{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Very well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations thank you well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortest rate shortest route to wealth okay\nAnd a baby step one is a thousand dollar shave too is that free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off our surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you've got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nTrack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um the uh the way I look at that is ... if you owed\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer well quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy those stocks\nDesigned by the way if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that\nAnd I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what's the house worth\nA it's on there were about a hundred and ...\nNational by twenty two years old with a paid four hundred and ten thousand dollar house or be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payments used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd uh you know what else will happen is did you do remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah I kinda started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on the oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years in front of it yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk and and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower\nSlave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\nYet no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so they will get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean mathematically relation leash\nUsually emotionally when you're free you just do better\nAnd you make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months be debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper\nYou are on your way sir so honored to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis high wind welcomes Ramsey show\nThanks Dave I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it's really made a difference in my life\nWell thank you ... Hill today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans which we're working on and then ah we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her\nFirst child and a April so we took your advice and a stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know that\nIs good and a out of this month we we now have enough for her to take her for a month maternity leave I'm paying for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem is there's Murphy has decided to strike a last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nWith a baby on the way here and another a two month we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on our home so my question is uh what would you do it in that situation that we we ate the police are maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA December the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball so by becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your bat\nCorrect as long as baby a mom will come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there's no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave\nUnless you have to have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it's so that we can use it so how much should we got piled up or will you have piled up by ... ...\n... Seventy five hundred dollars a month and like I said she was knowing that she's wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on just my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and it said that\nGoal to make sure that now so we got from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much [noise] um [noise] just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month that's where we have that um other than our car payments and do you have your back and all that balances you need to pay off\nTime no not really went on your car you know how much you owe on your phone rallies [noise]\nOn on and on dollars okay well then the four thousand would be your ... says you're paying off out of this guy and then as far as set aside enough for her to Texas for a month so you have the cash you should\nTake guys this is James Giles producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the

alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their well being would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and and put you on course for better things ahead\nBut that\nPayment

warmer water before visually making landfall and currently a running off across and Georgia that over towards the Carolinas obviously weakening as it does so\nAnd they fortress that will go a big step toward turning a Trump presidency into an imperial presidency in front of the furloughs check and balance like congressman the judicial system the census cases not the only case extending the imperial power as the presidency\nAnd the Supreme Court talkative upcoming cases there's also gamble versus the United states now here's what gamble versus the United states is about\nThe day if the president hurting as you you can still be prosecuted by the states the president's part and his only apart from federal offensive if the president prepares you for federal offense you could still be nailed by a state court\nA gamble versus the United states could count the sort of multiple prosecution of double jeopardy and make it illegal so the gamble case could rant ... power the president currently does not have the power to grant an absolute pardon a burden that applies to the federal and state level\nThis extended pardoning power could be very useful\nWith members of the Trump team like Paul Manafort\nOr Michael Cohen and if the president emphasized pardon himself equipped protective of from prosecution for the tax Dodgers associated with the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in New York Times reported on Tuesday the Trump received under the table from\nHis father many Democrats or that if he is cornered pardoning himself exactly what Trump will do and if he's challenge she

think that they will follow the path of the law but we shall see now Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com John\nIs with us\nNo I don't think he is and we and we wanted to get John's reaction to the

study doesn't assert that one's risk of contracting the flu varies depending on the size of any given community rather it argues that and less populous places\nThe flu needs the right atmospheric conditions to spread more effectively let's check and check in with Dr Gary right now we're hearing what about the flu season this year what do you think\nWell the flu season this year you and I have been discussing the flute for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the ... flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions it look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth\nThe confusion gets even worse when um the vaccine last year was only thirty four percent effective\nAnd now they've come out with a Lebanon flu vaccines on the market\nAnd the CDC has picked up the shop gun and\nFired away too many hey use any one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all because your drugstore may be offering a vaccine would be the cheapest one they can get a hold of that is true\nThere is no ... no one vaccine for everybody the nasal spray is back again after being denied for two years by the CDC and my confusion and it's you know as a doctor is I have to tell my patients the risks and let them\nDecide because I'm I'm not a you know I can push this like this but you know the Cleveland Browns one today and maybe I'll get a shot and get lucky\nYou never know thanks Gary Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com is back with us from his reaction on the Brett Kavanaugh's appointments go ahead John\nWell you know you know the most interesting thing about this is how the Democrats pushed and pushed and finally like perpetually that\nYou know for an FBI probe but guess what George have there been no FBI probe fears and colon probably would have voted no and so it's quite right so the Democrats kind of a you know have this one on their own had even though Cory Booker today it's calling for impeachment of cabinet\nOut of there now they're calling for them to give the guy a chance now that he's in for crying out\nLoud yeah I mean you know but again he's preaching to the choir in Iowa you know as a potential uh twenty twenty presidential candidate but I think one of the things that they tried to turn this into what\nWe want to really investigate is drinking behavior in high school and in college and this is where they think that they have and then an impeachable offense where nobody interested\nIn his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witness she named Dan this is over and Susan calling gauge very uh it was and comprehensive\nExplanation of why she voted for him because if the person's after the presumption of innocence and our constitution gr innocent until proven guilty they have no proof\nWhen will this pass John\n[noise] no it won't ... this particular issue all house\nBut the bitterness and the rancor between the two party system will not pass you know looking at\nA government that is at loggerheads there's almost nothing on which they can agree

you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be here is if the one in Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most\nExtreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance\nAnd say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nUs better to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorist talk about talk\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics and our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate\nFor us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knew something at the time\nBut when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise]\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call 'em visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see the possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing

blah\nFind out more about tonight's just log on to coast to coast am dot com\n\n\nAnd now look back at this week in history this week in Eighteen forty five of the United States Naval academy opens in Annapolis, Maryland with fifty minutes shipments students in seven professors\n\nThe naval school officially became the U.S Naval Academy and he's he's fifty\nAnd a new curriculum went into effect requiring mission to study at the academy for four years to train aboard shifts each summer\nThe basic format that remains at the academy to this day this week in Nineteen sixty eight Apollo seven first manned Apollo mission is launch with astronauts Waltzer Sheeran junior done he saw and Walter Cunningham abortions under the command if share of the crew of\nApollo seven conducting an eleven de

every top forty hitter marking started his eventual transition from little known figure to international superstar twenty six year old Bruce Springsteen had too heavily promoted major label albums behind him nothing approaching a popular here\n\n\nAnd\nWelcome back to coast to coast George ... with you again I'm going to give you a little Halloween trivia year Halloween is an annual holiday ... celebrated each year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween is an interesting Josh\n[noise] yeah it absolutely is I mean that it goes back thousands of years and um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with of course\nThey were ... you know reaping the rewards of harvest but preparing for the cold dead month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto the cold dead time\nThat there was a period where the the bill was so thin in fact Europeans often talk about what they call Finn places the boundary with so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we could encounter each other for at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other\nAnd the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then they're also all of these creepy evil being thinking through and so you'd you'd wear a mask [noise]\nSo do you blend in with evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us you know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when\nA here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun and so that means not only does it get colder and darker as we built in to that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a I shine a flashlight at toward you outside on a bright sunny day\nWhile you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night right and so what happens in\nGeneral but it's still there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is the time of\nYear when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with the spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also it happening this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for more\nLet's take some calls here what's your Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert ... to a dollar in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles go ahead\nYou're with us no\nHe's not let's give John in Virginia Beach Virginia try John go ahead\nGeorge Guy but um I won't tell you the story that happy they like in the nineties now I I never believed in\n... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen leaders Middle East I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a memorial service pointed at church\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I decided to go anyway I uh I went I was late getting have so I had to sit in the black church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the ... the church and I looked up and it was my uncle had just\nPassed away and and he\nTold me he said John ... your car and I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I get up get re read and what he was gone but still I was a new assembly and so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and ask him if he meant bringing my collectively and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and that's over the cage full ... anyway he a guy in my car\nWhen they pull that that ... ... and they were hit by a truck and they they want to but they were extremely you know you could I mean they had ... votes\nAnd all that\nBut I never told me like this and that was really a lot to say anything about it with a tale of\nOf my close friends and um I don't let it way than not that I was sure they have the I guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they was injured in my car like they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I have a ... like a safe steroids ghost yes all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits and the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one especially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm that person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future\nTo a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover\nMight definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because\nHe still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking them out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this is all here and you know\nRobert was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um\nHe I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you\nHave to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into

the day room you know where the ... people come they do activities and all of a sudden I say this\nWill nine year old boy I Would say maybe ten eloquently I cooked steamed directly straight you know just that core I perfectly and he's looking at me and I start off and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard\nAnd so I was wondering it seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit you really show theirselves or\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was\nI don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone's watching them and I was just wondering might\nHuh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they said from what we understand no loans have died there but we don't know a full history\nWhile he's in hospital where do you think Josh [noise] well ...\nThank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy field being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nThan just don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of that goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Rowan Oak island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Sal on Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure it contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your then again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua ... dot com has no period after the

magazine uses his experience in journalism and his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on very background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up yeah\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and ghost stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories and a supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to research whether there were any good stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to\nCouple ghost stories with you know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into beaches to really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know most\nOf the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and\nSailors Marines uh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was that um [noise]\nKnow you want to make sure that you get the\nHistory right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew above the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just won the big corn oh we're custard less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was on the right sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning\nFrom one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard and\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially and it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nSo a serving our seniors five one mile walk and run will be held Saturday October twenty person via ... community church for additional

dot com a couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest punch in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles\nWas a great story of a ... yeah that's an amazing\nStory and a\nAnd usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft got her started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the people were nervous but I found a very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually was ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that uh what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at it sitting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerve\nCell in and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds\nYeah and we're hitting something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shelves were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book after you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap it luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and\nAnd some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the one sitcom shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is\nA a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going to take calls next dollar with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they so Michael Jackson walk up behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former ... home owned by Michael Jackson who claim to hear music coming

I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also\nA key part of a lot of a historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and the like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories and these tales of the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician\nA person that witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they sold the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider\n[noise]\nIt's Monday October eighth what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house for just setting the dairy move our pumpkins spicy platelets has killed tracks with labor is fine with no after day what\nThis is in full swing mystery\nBreak out all our great failure party playlists whether you're at home or the city I'm In new I our radio ... collection check him out now [noise]\n\nWhen the weather turns bad turn to your official weather station six hundred W.
