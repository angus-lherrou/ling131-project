backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out with the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced right\nAnd she's a victim over circumstance where she overreacted or circumstance yeah yeah and um when you tell me that that people cannot live in Denver because rent is hot on the other is a whole lot of people living in Denver proving it wrong proving yeah and I'm a show you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and should

student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWhere does the lending money come from Allen for these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans uh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a\nSomething that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans\nFrom all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared ...\nFederal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this\nReally comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus\nThis company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth than lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank get any private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists\nEvery other type of loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera can keep up with their budget [noise] um you know I was just in\nSyracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now your career that's tuition room board books\nUm for for your course for a\nFour year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat burst sheet they can't because there's this ... program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt there was a story just recently were\nLindsey a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder ... the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped on to our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when

with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine a and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy or these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to ... so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact\nIs really what's going on with student loans in particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number\nI mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids and the sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge\nA and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nI got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and laugh at it on the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support sealed\nAnd he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it but\nUh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company when I go to the owners of the night and a private plane crash no mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah it pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people so I think I owe here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive when I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof as well you know when you have this lane system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nThank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook on it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nOK I already knew to do in an office but now there's one thing they

lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for

very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold this ... this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he do try to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight and first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the alone no type of all the you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a third party closure company like like what you described\nAnd they get the information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nMore than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is\nOnly going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate fine the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBut my friend that had along with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful be alone there are no statute of limitations for these alone so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nWhen he released down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such

they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent strictly for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nProblem

which we did\nThat was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is my new documentary that I put out tell the story and\nYou grab them but you're right that story and and really to try and why don't you treat it as best as I can tell that story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon watch decade now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are hearing this has been the biggest single wherever the UFO community I think that the story that I think come\nAnd I would say this is the classification and released the British Government but the the revelation after decades of didn't know the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham often when it was run by secretive\nDefense intelligence agency and they feel that the day\nAnd you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on angle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid Tom to long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make honey you track all this stuff coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this walk strong guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in due course tonight you know they're gonna tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course as alien time yourself you know you can sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did decide teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script this thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way\nI have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a a recording studio you know\nPadded walls and headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Michael long I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor mayor dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI I think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThis field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms\nThat the young people you watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food to and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he got together with the\nTo the stars of people um\nAnd it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times when they have story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs\nCenter stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization M E T I O right\nUm well that's a very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well it always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a chip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nWhen
