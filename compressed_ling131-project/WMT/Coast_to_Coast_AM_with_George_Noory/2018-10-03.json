[laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so\nAh ... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy there are three types her whole life universe very boy universal live and just verbal life and a universe alive or variable universal laws and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it there's years\nYeah yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it 'cause you're not seeing good returns [noise]\nNo it's about eight percent returns but all the fees built into it I think eat up that it not more yeah\nYeah well and you usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll net somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you're just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making eight and there are fees are getting you down probably in the four ranger actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the teeth to the tune of another four or five percent that's where it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable Peru and\nAh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it address up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year\nFor one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars some of it is going to buy\nThe life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly OK mhm less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because of a A R T\nYou noticed that as well [laughter] I have not okay\nAnd uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it so it's a horrible plane when you die [noise]\nBut ah it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just add that just right got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor\n'cause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor\nIt's certainly possible [laughter] so it sounds like anyway it doesn't sound like most of the people in the mutual fund world don't sell this crap\nI say that they will neutral funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't sell this crap because nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by cash value insurance on any kind of there isn't one out there\nThere are just the cost of math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't a pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably\nSo I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance in place you need to drop this garbage that's what I Would do thanks for the call rather open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five just making friends in the insurance business every day here [laughter]\nCar leasing all live life insurance credit cards of payday lenders people that love Dave Ramsey not [laughter]\nOh and I forget ...

I. dot com call now\nNews radio on WMDs [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box telling me about the title for\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the or the third station the United states has man's since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew it was\nA Antarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewable thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind\nA you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple\nA the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nAnd now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen\nEighty six major air pollutants your old down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution and really is not accurate\nThe nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot which cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone

situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientists that he's saying and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the\nPrimary keeper of the world's temperatures are these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or a procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nDo urge is there to my job guy how's everybody doing than that you\nJust scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq as to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen [noise] [noise] yeah\nI don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under there you have\nTo call during the day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically\nSlow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nMuslim slowing down it's really not happening it was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay it's a whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll act and they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead you're on\nA Monday morning who uh who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind bills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind feels that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more ...\nBooth plane you know they were were burning off\nAbout ... people were asking now why don't you put a generator on that and\nWe'll do ... you know electricity now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air and inside and accuracy a there is one point

so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just dumb old they are two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people\nFrosty will reject may end or\nA ... a a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so so what's frosty has told us is this is just sat in\nThinking that we can see your ah that by

right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your

Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into it I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years\nAnd this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this\nA lot of sand but harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite mapped out\nTo the many years ago ... animated cartoon\nBut there's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked and it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters\nCould look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's have our with our weather\n... when I hear about it and the new\nLooks can Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe that the way to add on is being gay or engineered the chem trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people are so much more hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to the street and on the stock market on the weather they want or against that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd on top of that then you get the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant that what they were doing is gripping the oil um industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd me China's there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it got a point oh eight oh now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he

them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tree yet everybody was baffled by you know this turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told

in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they formed this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as\nThe ah the ah yesterday and the abominable\nBelow snowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe\nThat book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the time\nWell I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls\nIncident\nBut one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys that were all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them or to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS\nAre using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the hike\nWell when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was illuminating the trees around\nIt so that the parents and the it was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird [noise]\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through we want and as a jar okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separate from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white like with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately\nThere is a severe threat with these storms especially across northern central parts of the state\nAll forms of severe weather would be possible heavy rain is also likely
