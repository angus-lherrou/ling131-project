love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such as this tendency I out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer in the should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it he was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had to leave your car life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate experience\nNow was this before or after you became a hit in the ...\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your ... e where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nNo I was not quite I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself you need that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one and then\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the system's information Janine ... why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and the and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] did not want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express mhm\nYeah it is it absolutely is so\nNow when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because ... he'll meal you and he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an inch in is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared\nTo the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes ... you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an

preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to the travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way\nFor instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're\nThey're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise matter of fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm\nSkills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about something to finding Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our

through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with their higher self\nWith are multi dimensional fell right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have

he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain some of this to our audience [noise]\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying this practice in it for\nForty or just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences\nAnd this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar the kind of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis I'm being\nLifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through colors dial it if you're seeing through your clothes die live at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nYour non physical body because you're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on it because that happen if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think it's his muscles and nurse you're saying that's an out of body say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found\nAnd what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body such with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and\nWhen you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe\nThis actually during an out of body experience and what does it look like the image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream can they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine mhm and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nOne of the ways to discover what's really going on what\nThis multi dimensional game of chess wordplay ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awaken into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid get here\nWould you go into and it'll be and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander\nIn these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank I mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold of reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well well your\nCreative powerful being ... and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person I don't know anyone that um\n... owns a motorcycle\nAnd it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the night it was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because I mean I was scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an adult locked out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus there's\nMany types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right it's the gravity\nWe're used to air you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his left sandwiches astro info dot org you'll find out

saying can you really they pee on an original is is that necessary anyway I'll go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado doing our guys shows and I thought it was so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience\nWe are normal\nWell this I've been seeing go since I was in the in the high to a grasshopper is what I always say [noise]\nUm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can even community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called the kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the\nTwo of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name the spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention\nAnd uh we've we call it a little faith because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghost or things that go on and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him that he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nSee if it was possible that these things really happened and so that what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to thyroid cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you've you've\nI see it and I actually feel it\nI mean like image to examples that\nWell I can I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm In ... I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was at I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was hunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted that I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an\nOld haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually\nAnd living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just went to a place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm\nA balloon like loans and\nSaid that we would pass the house in five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house what what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son\nAnd he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about it just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that while I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things will allow Lou ... everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom must be on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about manatees Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie water I Am the guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\n\nRadio the WMD [noise]\n\n\nOverboard what's new today on the radio a radio\nWe were perfect for decorating the house or just studying the moon\n... what we're going to apologize\nEveryone's talking about like some people were bowlers falter Joe Rogan a serious all your music all your\nRadio\nWaves keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.

more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... miles in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... you\nKnow I'm\nI think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that you\nKnow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating but now she's seen the operation of does not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before book\nYes oh yes

the way that it bounces off the rocks and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now hunted or did you might have been non ... and the gas the ghost follow you\nRight yes they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend said well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's gotten a lot of history\nYeah yeah you have to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life I used\nTo happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of metrics I'm really I'm Serious I was just wondering if it happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there other other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's\nThe essence part rain there oh yeah you know this family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with a red energy\nI find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine is you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of a war of the pikes peak they believe was the naval\nOf the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat or anything I Love that stuff [laughter] hikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot\nOf um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the ... latest one you have for\nAt five five and it all came about after cancer was on my bucket\nList I'm a big believer in manifestation [laughter] and you find now I Am fine and it's wonderful and I'm so grateful to God thank you for asking\n[laughter] All right we're going to come back and find out about it from you [laughter] All right my guess is definitely waters and we will be right back I'm ... and you're listening to decode\nDum\n\nDum\n\n\n\nReviewers reasonable\nOn Sunday's super girl sweeps back in for a fourth season followed by the

I think it was called T. T. V. A.\nT. that are have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that\nI loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why are you would call that that's connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThere and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world\nI Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers the flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards without the town it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hungry and they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons witness behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically ... up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ...\nA fascinating and they didn't know what till they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere weren't a lot of people out yet but a lot of people saw this I mean\nJust outrageously crazy and he found his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere is no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there to conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as a the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to the back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big foot\nActually rubbed at the high any on his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writing\nHe believes that my friend he only if it's um you know it's like stick figure I find that fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a portal\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that\nMaybe big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature Bigfoot now would say\n[laughter] I wouldn't have gone tiny for no\nThere there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the ... Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean that's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense\nYou know all of a thing being once we decide on it now\nPerfect for decorating the house or just letting the dairy mood\nPumpkins ... has ... with labor inspired why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people ... the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nWhen the weather returns bad turn to Europe Fishell weather station six hundred W.
