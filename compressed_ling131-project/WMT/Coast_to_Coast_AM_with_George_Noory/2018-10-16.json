{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Kind of perfect for your furniture building doesn't okay right [laughter]\nThat's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself\nSaid I'm a young entrepreneur in right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in that space that just screams confidence and I love that\nI Will tell you one of the great things a million I see a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started his little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multimillion dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage you\nThe idea that it's difficult to get in this space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy them if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the market place they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture\nI Am I'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife went through a decorator and how can you tell in either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand that advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you did does it have to be a barrier for you if you want to get an advantage is just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you saw that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust to get started dip your toe in the water and million will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow to business\nAnd start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like David said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you all for the marketplace through your business and excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call grow you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a show in a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage and\nAlthough I Would want to read them money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks a kind of figured out everybody wants to buy a money book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity\nThat felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brain differentiate or because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a a different kind of\nLook different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet somehow you know get in there with the big ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... the opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy insecurity\nI thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had on her leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne Suzanne didn't secrets then in ... in a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how do I don't think the women women leaders women leader on how you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt's bigger in our head than it is in reality it's to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love that whole perspective Amelia ah that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take the steps\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know we had county Rosh ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American\nObviously Hooper brilliant oh you get smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean\n... successful I mean secretary of state right the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShe should growing up in a segregated neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama her mama told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good and she said I don't let other people with their prejudice decide\nMy fate yep I decide my ... and it was like coming out it was just very calm but yeah I heard it loud and clear confidence in their ... but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going to own the space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage race sex whatever it is you got into an advantage because it's Brenda ...\nWell I Love how you've been talked about you and share and buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions\nWhen I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the spaces are creating furniture and plants and a white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch via email design so far at least you think she does not only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know she gets me so a really evil will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is good information the book is business boutique it has a number one buzz shower and you can see why\nChristie ride is with us the founder of that you don't hear her speak all over America and teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her at ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get\n... from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yeah very well

may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house\nThat you're able to encourage them and give them at the steps and

their promotions what changes your life um you don't you don't you know you can listen to music and if you're if for those will be in the car all day I mean if you listen to the same if you listen to

bizarre first of all don't think that this is some kind of multimillion\nStole their eyes [laughter] tiny\nKind of a a little island of north Barry which is very near Denver and the reason I bought it is a semi reason but here it is when England played Scotland and I'm Talking about football now soccer\nSoccer soccer here yeah\nYeah England were concerned although there are better than Scott and they were concerned that they might lose to Scotland so what they do these they called me up they put me in a helicopter and I flew around when Billy ... is a huge stadium it's a national stadium of of the ... [noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players when they the ... started the England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the the strike her you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most\nGets a penalty which means that Ninety percent there would score Scotland would score a goal and from the helicopter believe it or not I move the blown away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice\nCream in the helicopter one two three move and the boom moves away this has been documented by the BBC filmed and if you get on my Web site go to those those Eighteen most fascinating moments in ... in British history or football you'll see the ball moving away [noise]\nSo you can imagine the next day I received thousands and thousands of hate letters and emails from Scotty\nHelps corps yeah they want they want to you on this one [laughter] yeah\nYou know it's okay to inspire and motivate the team but tuned to fear and move it boiled away with the power of their mind isn't no no it's actually illegal\nSo I had to give back something to do the Scottish people so I decided to buy a Scottish island which makes me kind of ...\nAll right have they have they welcomed with open arms again\nOh yes yes yes now listen this this island it's called ... island\nAnd it's it's ... it's very mysterious in any magic it's it's um it's first first of all I don't even know how to start but it it's the island is a like a volcanic out crook in their first in forth which is north of Denver\nAnd um it is of of scientific interest this is why it was quite surprised and actually shocked that scope and sold me the island that I could buy the island because it's a it mirrors\nNot listened to this it mirrors the great pyramids of Scotland which mirror they lay out of\nThe pyramids of Giza while\nCairo and I'm fascinated by the connection between the pyramids in these islands you know that the connection has been known for centuries George you can read about teeth in them in a book pizza fifteenth century manuscript coal difficulty grown it's by an ...

M. T. [noise]\n\n\n\nBanned won't come back to coast to coast Mitch Horwitz with us or one of today's most widely known voices of spirituality ... also in award winning historian longtime friend that goes to goes day I'm off gorge and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith finances and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group when he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday ah we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nWhich have you found the people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be\nCareful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\nBefore you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great Mentalist and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help\nThe Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved up and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost that he couldn't find it and he was telling me about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tide class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it\nYeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing to look for that [laughter]\nI was just amazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour\nI'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if\nYou are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely sure now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nNews radio six

the gothic state it is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time in essence Patel a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're coming to consciousness\nIn the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself in\nIt seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on a computer I mean get out an old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it\nMorning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those the it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that the method we can all do it is easy isn't that once you get into it\nIt is easy that the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one name has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism\nThey become an enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics\nIn the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel\nLike I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do the patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there is no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that is true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me\nAnd I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take you to my Web site in my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet it's just something fun to have with you\nTo sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your

membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories overwhelm you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstance\nWill come back with calls next on coast to

A. dot com\nSix on WMD [noise]\n\n\nThen we'll come back to the coast to coast George George with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal it really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of the magic key to all of this material I Would say that\nAbsolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it or something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is\nThat we really need to have one absolutely definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature which with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the uh thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who were drivers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend\nIn New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nIn God and was though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to married he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\nBeing in the ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend you truly felt like a miracle\nThat is American it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visits extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and Congress and state just before we fall asleep at night\nAn act in image in your mind enact a scene that's something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb a ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder to climb climb you know really feel those rungs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back\nIf you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality it may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it your assumptions harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin Joe when Clinton

we wish for other people rebounds to us because in effect you know if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great\nOver mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called at the oversold new pony and he'll called an infinite mind in a sense once we've determined that the mind is extra physical we determined that we're all\nConnected that separation is just illusory so what we wish for others
