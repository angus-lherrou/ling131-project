rat heart there's only poisoning figure deal smaller\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home\nA and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called\nModern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of\nThat is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be\nRemoved by somebody like me\nFrom the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere\nTo make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nCall me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world\nIt builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes there are already\nIn the homes sometimes they come into the home they sense of family that's having a problem\nBecause of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to\nCall maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies the energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nOr they're qualified exorcist and just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work in past lives um I have\nDeep contacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot com his book is

[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey Schumann with us we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nAh both a just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand a centrally at a bunch of them it haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against for years and years and years for a few is all invitations I finally\nUh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so\nAh it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people didn't believe in ghost had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and\nI was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cars are people on it and uh\nI was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called in\nThe fashion learn but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place has really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters\nWarning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite need yeah 'cause they'll follow people home negative spirit just they will get\nChanel to get your later so I was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just\nTerrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately or what this thing was doing was it was singing and ... song but I'd never heard\nReally I Can't it's strange possible to describe\nIt was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by and it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear\nThis horrific song slowly\nAnd I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I have to change me a from being very happy\nAnd we've been very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to loom\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client and I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Jeffrey I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly and not only times\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just work in a negative environment\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drain\nBecause they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy and we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending\nNegative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit and so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks\nA lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego were bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinutes already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking\nAround really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop\nBecause the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople who go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean think of\nThe moon she didn't\nElated and so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it\nI teach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know\nMost all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood

sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems\nA depression anger issues unhappiness ah overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right\nMeaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually working on them for a long time and they can cause physical ...\nHe's even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of sudden demonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power\nSuddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirit to quit being evil or you know the trip pan turtle like I go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychic back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said when I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time plenty spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits\nDemonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window\nI I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions sisters out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kinda stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they loved it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream was on the loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot\nI Would would not be surprised at all that she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a ... dream\nSoon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that we've not open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't you're okay where are you\nA um ... um I had a um a thing you and I couldn't really believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little bit of the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was at a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf it was real or if the devil real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm going back to the point when I was\nKnow whatever and uh uh as God and I was like ... if\nYou know your eye on everything Israel you know show me 'cause I Would like to know I Would like late ... so uh it started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened then I\nI started in these little things like um with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight ... it seemed like everybody and he had friends he everything he did he touch was known I mean if even one like ... ... you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one camp he didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nNo a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it it's not that told me that he was willing to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he just didn't have one at that time and um I Believe it was kind of ... just to show me that you know how it works or whatever you know and then\nI bought a church in a ... a chemical about it you just call me you know you go to church you know and I'm so we'd go to church well why would the church I woke him and I started the ... will will be angels like\nIn our early on the church all over the place\nAll of them around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the Greek you mean um [noise] they get all the way around it and I had never seen anything like that you know like where we will be I mean these things is like a ... foot tall seemed like\nFollowers on Twitter if you need to email me like Ken did that's George ... coast to coast damn dot com I look at 'em all I can respond to all of them because we have just we too many\nUh but a check in with us so we've got off the lines for you or partially next hour or two and then William Henry is joining us to talk about the evil watchers but that's later on on the coast to coast day\nOne of the perks of being a coast insider is that you can participate in our twice a month we lived transitions or read the transcripts leader George ... chats with insiders and the second Tuesday the month and a special gift is featured leader in the\nClip the coast insider Lincoln's coast to coast am dot com to get started\n[laughter]\nSaturday I covered their dean what's new today on the free I our radio I\nLeeway for decorating the house or just letting the theory mood [laughter]\nSpicy platelets has she'll tracks with labor in my life so we've got a cat and everyone is talking about like the fantasy football or a CAT scan the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station all\nAlways keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.
