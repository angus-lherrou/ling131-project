disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from so ...\nIs a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell I'll say right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime\nAll of us who've and using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nOr per head using us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place\nAnd that's a time at ... at the end at the\nTime well did it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke what did you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems I guess their stock has been a walloped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there or you know kind of messages to the troops the kind of try to cheer them up\nUh it it it appears that's a pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that's you know that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly ... you can live off the ball and as you can really uh fall flat later on whether or not snapshot steps that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the other star of of the moment like they were some time ago\n... thanks Lorna appreciate it up next an end the upside down

in the upside down thinking march ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell look as a cycle ... says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is ...\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present zeros and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in ... people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround event that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example where we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically in a tight a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events what do we find\nThat there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nBurn yell or you know that name of course an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now they're\nWho said dollar each trickery its magic but if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n[noise] [noise] well I've heard of of doing bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked\nInto it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller than\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of student ending it in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in a direct quote from a classified document where\nHe was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the ability that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nShore

if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever started hated and the experimenter talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than at the people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... party at from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the rain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation and two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defendant later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when that April later went off and it made very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back in described to sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing Emmys dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nIt doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school and looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping as one person in particular was look at these phenomenon and\nIs is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets the theory that\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit ... with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat is such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us\nAt our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist anti materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and these ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious as goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nThe new ... new space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically\nI liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude happens in X or at the antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nBack chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nGoing back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind and that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the minds of those things that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other\nSo here's a simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience\nIt's not the producer of consciousness what ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just this remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to distance to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how\nThank you for

folks that lived in that country that made that animal of pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way using it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism\nWhich if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves that to me that that has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your Web site where people can get your book in into upside down

[noise]\n\n\nWell\nThis is that time of year where we talk about those stories and we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong and collected Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Salem, Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand\nBut also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me look good for to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nSomething about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know\nHe's very a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is a salmon and feel often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very on you know she's a big prize on ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days\nIt was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of these and then it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of them\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you sent disability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls in the same\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal it did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my\nFather she is normal um but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but saying metaphysical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in there and you finally told me that if you don't want Marlene ... from my family\nFor many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll than of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I didn't know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted\nIn her city or in her town um so ... it's hot and now I mean I don't know have a lot to really judged by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\n\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a Jesse I'm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that with her truth out she was very unique that what you say\nSo the story that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nNow you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one what is that\nA well rounded much\nThat didn't mean to tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he didn't have to do it on something so he\nChose you know doing it and go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individual\nThat you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation so people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but\nWe're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes jar what do you think there\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed\nIn her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs or you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of that just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nYou know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and [noise] and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she is yeah [laughter] he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little\nGirl and I want you here

him called me up and asked me to check out his house so I get married you know we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big do it's a and the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nOne of ... separated me from the other one and the other one talked marina we later found out that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted Murray and come back and well but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's wonderful left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment run do you bring with you a very\nOn on on a particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more a piece of equipment a\nSmall case the lesser amount but you always want to uh you know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... being seen\nYou might bring more video equipment or you know like ... or ... whatever but you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies avoiding we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the worst and the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations ... probably four times um but the interesting\nPart about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes censor that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one guy do these goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House that we do these haunted toys\nAnd one time we were in this um [noise] it's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you\nAnd say use windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself and she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for ... I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally I said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it and yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nVaccine vocation is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing woman walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing I'm an I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes typed on uh\nWhat Iowa lighthouse in Bedford pool meal I mean we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting at a picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen nice our dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman he or she says right would you see that's just that's our dog she says can you describe much sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog ... died in ... I don't she says the dog you described pretty much matches\nBecause she has a dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was it do I know but so I mean is two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both the euro will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up at coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's guess log on to go to ... dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\nPan handle on jak Callahan Fox News lunchtime today or shortly afterwards hurricane Michael expected to make landfall as a category ... hurricane near Panama City Florida wins above one hundred thirty miles an hour and says jak then at the national Hurricane Center a virtual wall water rushing onshore\nOver a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line to learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule plus assay one line accepts most transfer credits for information tax base to three five five point seven learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal makes you stay\nIn the nation for producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent of ask you grab recruited within Ninety Days a\nGraduation learn to grow learn to succeed and learned to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about ASU one line degrees space to three five five one seven that's PAC eating three five five one seven\nSix on WMDs [noise]\n\nThan\nRoll comeback to coast to coast wrong collection Maureen ... with us and we're going to take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning\nThere you go [laughter] so how often do you get to calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but are there are so many group so like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... the other day it was news like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael does just that image know of the ... the center right now has a scarlet ... I don't know if you've\nSeen that yet or no I haven't seen that yeah it's pretty that's your own it's our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from a four to nothing that would be good [laughter] we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if I'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of tickle area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to\nGet too much into the details with tour of the coin is for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call ...\n... um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next coming or being a lot better police things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nKnow that's for sure yes [laughter] yes it was\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto\nA lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year now are things that have been happening is like a pressure right though because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that for you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put on a mask but you're not feeling it is that correct or no\n[noise] ah right [noise] yeah\nYeah okay right so what you think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person it feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there yeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patients with yourself in your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine that these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it it\nDoesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think well it's October Halloween to you then right we need to be out there um and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busy or around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably busy constantly\nMaureen what do you think of ...\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't think that's something to be afraid of them I just think it's ... it's the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know your
