you\nI'm well Richard\nThanks for having me on my pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini he's um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking\nWhat they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all and mussels or for this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed for four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake comedian he\nWould send his assistance out and they would find these people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal\nAnd Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know ... where there would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very sick and\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was it I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fighting in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fans just fans crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she

and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister's eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to morphine a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum\nWith pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret do three things that\nYou kind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nBut this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't\nI I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count\nBut the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe\nFor her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it\nStrong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was trick and didn't do shit but strict she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance for it at the end of that

don't really get we had already broken the Japanese POWs I had a conversation about this with Oliver Stone twenty Thirteen he came out with a series\nThe other side of history I Believe a DVD serious yes he's he came to the exact same thing and this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it at least as I Do all my own research\nAnd you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just\nA matter of one that had to happen\nAnd so uh Ghana or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to fell I Know they had at least a week's notice\nAnd you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor so they were not at Pearl Harbor when the attack happened\nWhich is a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty pretty pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong sorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where\nA you'd be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so it was pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same you know to support that conclusion\nThat said they definitely had a as a matter of fact the history\nChannel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel they even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archive that suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought wow\nHey look at that you

Elvis Presley uh now we're discussing the murder of\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt the thirty second president um before we get into the the the second World War I just wanted to mention Mussolini and um there was a time when I don't I don't believe you address it in the book but FDR was also\nA a an admirer of Mussolini or when he first came to power because Mussolini was kind of build as a um as a real progressive um you know he was ... and he wrote for the communist newspaper Mussolini did in his I Believe is propaganda minister was sort of the\nUm or the top a communist thinkers so you know fascism in its early beginnings they were communists and that's just the way it is it's a fact\nUh and and I think they kind of ... a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think\nUm when Mussolini was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so I I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter but um when they entered the war\nRoosevelt wanted a pact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that I did go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address which will anything you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolized Mussolini at first it was an ... so ... he actually started the whole but you know again I'm history books being what they are that that was the last\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\nI'm covering Coventry in in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England cans are losing their island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nNow we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course the two had met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church who was the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar at the time that Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nYeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure I ... I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion that you are it seemed that the ... and reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like when he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and ... and Stalin had to pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good they're doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's\nDrug habit at the time he was on like thirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional\nDictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read\nUm meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd he'll just says well I don't care I Want to go do it so\nStyling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little\nLittle hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and\nAnd then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nAlways keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.\nM.
