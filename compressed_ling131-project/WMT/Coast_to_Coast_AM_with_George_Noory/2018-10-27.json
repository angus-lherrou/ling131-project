I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue you know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get the forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so it'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process on this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\n[noise] okay um and if\nYou want a soup your emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated a ... a principled process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better is that logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or past or somebody else on you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this show the what I've been told I don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know the\nFamily and I are wary about urban crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of killing shoulders safety and that's what I'm looking for but I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being Alicia ...

insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a stretcher and products so like you know term insurance and a lot to do the which I agreed with and then I Need it\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead he reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some or some other coach there were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned you know those are those are kind of like\nLetting those insurance companies aren't good they're on there\nRatings are high financially you want to go with the more higher expensive uh insurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next Twenty years you know I'm going to show you know I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy so he basically described as a Mercedes of ensuring he need to buy you said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah how do I wanted to get your thoughts on that\nWell that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\n... they're almost broke the state well let them sell in your state\nYes I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nMy English are sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check to financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about those progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look at the AM best ratings of someone at Zander insurances website and they are all financially solvent as much as this group or that sell any of the stuff that's a that's a complete line of BS rum Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better because I yeah I went ahead and do the the less expensive option anyway as you say well I wouldn't I wouldn't do that from my\nFamily ah yeah you are now\nSelling on ... and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they called call you that tells you the one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah yeah if you were doing investments with them if you're doing

[noise]\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science\nBorder for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard is wells author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper questions that I raised in the book and that is\nWith all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow where to find the natural order of things\nAnd he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice and I was not nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive trade since the pressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're\nFighting against you know a billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight are we to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far\nEnough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so from the sun but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we want supposed about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... it just putting it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that's the day of the singularity that's what the day ... singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be\nBut we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that the you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get

O. take your privacy back with my pseudo\nNews radio six hundred WMD team [noise]\n\n\nI Want to make sure to leave some time to talk about future of privacy where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThe conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical\nUm enhanced Schmitz from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for deformity um and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in by breeder and some of the other stuff that's about it but it's in the book but the part I thought it was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because\nI I I think there does idea the eggs those skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or they have lost their ability to walk on the bench spinal injuries and and that this to them is a dream ... you're just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about\n... humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement called the trans human movement where as you said the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that usable\nA trend human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's ...\nAnd I I agree with you I I this is an area where I see very little down\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nYou know of severely cripple\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have ... you know these are these are armed that he\nCan move with it so they're they're wired\nMind and I was amazed and fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being\nFacetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free\nIsn't it I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I\nAgain I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities\nBut I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the coalition a group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are\nRobot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes do you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words do give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now in another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same\nYou know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate\nOur weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor tuna ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know\nYou know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ...

M. T. [noise]\n\n\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found with a woman was wearing these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the vet\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that are\nThere's like no like national consensus [laughter] this is the goal but\nAnd and I think that there's and there's a lot of education I remember and I'm sure you're you're older than me are the same age as as I Am as as I remember being told by an aunt of mine that a a a cousin that was being born in the family wouldn't have a soul because she was a test tube babies\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it's like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education peas in and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into like the F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read your schedule right are you going to be on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up there I think you you were talking\nAbout immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the revelation that talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is work out a finance high and it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this theory that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian\nI'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky less a a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd soul yawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the sky net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the horror from saying or from the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so ... ... ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible and the the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and then or if they do we just leave them and we just lost\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try to him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI uh I enjoy

what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney stones macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration ah that will help actually restore\nSight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these same era\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells are ... create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is

watched this video of the Oregon pot shop and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nIn downtown Oregon City here are very funny at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero trees a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on a counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy going that's next to it\nAs it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing next to somebody with like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that has happened then Andy remembered the surveillance hand like we saw this I\nNot long after that this happened watched the Penn ... it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos the doctor as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... states had many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a form of ... to\n... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it and you want to jump in on open

are where nothing because they sleep\nRight uh you know we can try to play God but I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not gosh that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say in it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I ... apologize first off or not and for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this in March ... her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what it is a fireman now further more in our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first a vital situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormon too are you know I'm I'm surprised for\nThree years to come for for families with multiple wives with multiple showed her with multiple multiple and um\nAnd we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not he is our\nUse of all and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if the supplies what's known somebody who was in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to I'm falling scare myself\nNot to a consumer companies supplies but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even his thing then sell\nAn interest or you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in these codes or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear for people most LDS do not practiced plural marriage really the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called uh like the men with three wives or three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the

times this first time I've gotten three this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a\nAnd there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a viable for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the ... religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and quoting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the new this in the New Testament the current estimate yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because of the historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as he as he did\nBut that that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and

learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about a true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies you'd think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from a from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that
