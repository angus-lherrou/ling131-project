{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "And we are number one we owe a hundred and seven and want to worry about one fifty five which are in rental property number two um we owe one sixty five and it's about Ninety five right\nYou're making a little profit you may get a lot\nNow it's about a thousand in mind I mean it's definitely not\nI Know that that's an AR ...\nKnow that your gross that's before you count vacancy and major repairs that come up\nThat that's the gross cash flow the different ... and the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut you know ... yeah fire five ... five grand ... something like that I'm a ... a year something like that mhm Oprah I Am ... I mean some years will be better than others and that kind of a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things in my head that's um\nThe uh uh ... and what your household income\n[noise] um so we bring about a hundred and ten gray to tell you what do you own your home our primary um we just heard to stay on ten months ago we\nOwe to eighty worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's why he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right\n[noise] yeah 'cause I thought it on as soon as we have about ten thousand dollars in and got that in your ... um we have combined probably twelve thousand 'cause we took him we had a lot but we took a bite out of a few after that so\nMany help you know the ... like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't sort of do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you guys are going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd rather check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I I was hesitating because not because you're doing airplane and you\nKnow it's just at the end of the year I'm always really tough and I feel you know in Iran\nSo it was just there in the event that on my condition that don't come through for the next three nights I'm afraid of liquid data Atlantic I don't think an actor in life being a spot so I figure on Christmas that everything goes wild than I Would just try to track\nMhm okay that you're playing poker or any of\nThe uh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip on your pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two I mean I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in in more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so on my way one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got fifty thousand more equity unilaterally making anything on that and that you're in a gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year ... lose money on that house if you go to three months vacancy if the market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on Peru in getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly and you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike how are ya\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund saw him among baby step on um the first time I'm doing a budget and it's a mess it just seems like a just dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay All right and they're all going in\nA while it just seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get up things are just as the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there\nBut you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know what I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military\nEndless group and his brand new book is called and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me refusing\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national six\nI mean the adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place in Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build the practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons uh and\n... to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand I think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against ... clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away I\nWant to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the\nCold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished or when\nHe called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a\nFormer Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know putting of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nOn this down with Joe leaving just

they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not\nNot just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera um that that's\nDisturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're doing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions if you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that uh the cars so sugary situation is is tragic uh but if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably\nBeen cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got a you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that the idea being\nThat we we have to have partners\nIn that part of the world it's a dangerous game this airplane we see

Decatur destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over a you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared in case the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a a couple of hundred and\nIt's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled him and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um\nTo that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you\nSee the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and\nAnd put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had or want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nA and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path\nHaving a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one once too\nOften in like ... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively use to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other uh fat to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we try to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk pride to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nWell another fallout from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influence so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and in Saudi Arabia's well here's van Morrison taking us into the break with a band

come back with a several of the people that you've been a living or incarnate it from a previous life\nHere's the problem I have sort of philosophically with without a and\nIs it possible that we in reincarnate I suppose I I don't happen to believe it that's just me but here's one of the things that bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example or to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case I think you will you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes\nI I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that person has to learn from [noise] then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave\n'em I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they can run into a because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous um\nCircumstances yes is this is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're over calming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in
