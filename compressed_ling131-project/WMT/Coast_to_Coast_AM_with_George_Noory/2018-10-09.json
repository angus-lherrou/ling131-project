{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "How old are you are on twenty four of them and how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check yes absolutely what he's trying to lose\nAny we uh we just need to pray about it and figure out what what's the most wise decision\nWhich I how much a check for twenty seven five will not pay off everything\nI'm not quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe the ... of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund so who passed away\nMy grandfather okay All right\nWell there's a couple of gauges we want to do a number one we want to be biblical was which is what she was saying and pray about this and the number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile\nOddly enough that these are actually the exact same things um because when you start doing smart things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in\nAnd that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university and I want you to park their money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card a debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a better for the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to impart there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial position where she okay\nAnd and attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been redrawn since you saw them and\nUh you go through those then when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and worked the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors\nAnd have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to straighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors\nAnd when you all are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this we're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave ... financial ... ish wise is we're not gonna ish it and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\nAnd that's what I'm telling you to do a is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that um we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value and it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find the guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's why I'll ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer listener forgive me for my ignorance I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars\nI mean that includes our cars we do not have a mortgage we currently rank now my question is\nUm we're going to have paid off within the next few years maybe even a year right now we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country however we would have to\nFigure this Harvey and something to tell where we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older\nI'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just want to see what's\nHere in America would be a\nSnake dream I live in the dream cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money off on broke people right and um and if you borrow on something\nThat goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV\nAnd other people all around and mowed jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous or they're just a mess\nAnd so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd a show you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nAnd it's the talk I okay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it somewhat of a loss at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it\nInto a nightmare right it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand in an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty right\nAnd you're going to be stuck in a wing all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different um\nAnd when you add all of this up it might be that you guys could stay in your you ... could travel in your car um or your SUV or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you add it all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts bite off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand bang or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm going to be mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win a thanks for the call

artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the lawn mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't\nThink so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain is a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nThen over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred than two hundred and two thousand than two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about ... I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because\nThe single one was a transposed with a ... an obese transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane for people\nI think you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nUh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did that being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is\nA ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of\nArtificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's\nSomebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have that but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's\nGoing to have\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers\n... or ... whatever country you are and and and third you know that they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run\nWe don't know what some other country will Oh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it\nIsn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these

[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back by run race with a survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um I I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really walk machines to do it I mean 'cause if\nIf the machine can do a job to make a human do that job this word for that that's called B humanizing mhm\nBecause if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that that we invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the job Spanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right\nAnd we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody sees as it\nAnd says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be the sweat thing people are going to use it what do you think that's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear that we don't want to live I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know you you still a drink\nYou know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your foot back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills and those are things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult\nYeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there are going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house silver figures out where to punch you're all out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells\nKnow say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that um but like you said that you know yet\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's\nAn open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\n... it may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore because 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nUh you invented a nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world a giant civilizations and merge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's gonna what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nBut what we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing did we\nNo not at all\nNot at all and has displaced workers\nProbably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\n\nWe still have a couple more days of wet weather to get through before this pattern finally breaks open our scattered showers and thunderstorms are around with mild overnight lows in the mail sixties on Tuesday we have periods of showers and thunderstorms best chance is going to be as we get later in the day will be watching for locally heavy rain and hide and then they do operate seventies\nShowers and storms are likely Tuesday night with locally heavy rain some guy in the winter a possibility as well those are back close to sixty on Wednesday scattered showers and storms mainly the midday hours\nGold friend is going to be bringing in cooler temperatures so we'll have a morning high in the sixties then fall during the afternoon it will be turning windy as well\nMostly sunny still windy on Thursday with hides in the upper forties to around fifty mid forties on friday with a chance of a couple of showering ...

to ask your guest there um if you think that the way technology is progressing that when they get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as\nWorking alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said\nA hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours until you have to ask like well what happened because she did go on a fault just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that\nIf you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty Bel Air conditioning six hundred square feet medical insurance no higher education notification grow your own food make your own clothes you can work fifty hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human watts it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late\nThe fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has\nA so we're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you could imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine a\nFixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faith than than being a wife and

you're the guest barbed is entirely right are we are using a ton of his\nWeapons we make kill decision of course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decided that's non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth\nA it's a subtle distinctions but part I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever five books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just does it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out\nJumped to their IQ simple things one uh individual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ seventeenth fifty nothing happened what if you looked studying Seventeen fifty it shot up like a rocket\nUm why because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created or eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is\nAll purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like

you know that the world strains to feed them\nOr we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to

genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to yeah he is a\nMan I I have some great stories about him where he is just allowed me and to um like the the theater where they record all the music and he said Julie stand here this is where the director stands and they you know it's the best place to here they get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou got a great background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly written Oklahoma\nTalking about my day job your day job we haven't done the Oklahoma new Bill Bill we do [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd you how did you end up in Los Angeles on the truck work for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma and I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd who you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls their book that goes photographer\nWhat'd you some of your peers said about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ... would talk for\n[noise] you know this it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm now and you know within the organization that thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling the stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff and\nYou know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nUm you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so\nYou know people could feel liberated it's just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences because it's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd even if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything that goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of the things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in God if there were almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google on to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is going to work with\nThat are saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... started for you because of a personal situation\nYes tell us head you know if\nThis started from me I'm I'm I made the book really is a journey and develop transformational Journey Through grief [noise] um I lost my mother to all timers\nAre and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone on and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing post and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost Porto because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about ten forget exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes well hold her guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of if\nYou have been doing Sam me things what kind of cameras\n[laughter] and I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron out of phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else\nInteresting now\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to these strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um\nI I started you know after I saw the first coast in a photograph I um you know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be\nHonest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as then it's not true\nSkeptics that you want to know\nRight right I it it was in a this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I deal with any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos and when you're in\nChaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became I I think maybe a little bit of an expert in

Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about that show planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory which we're pretty sure\nNot terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have had a bad because you know what the light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but\n... yeah the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA at what happened that last time that Alex ... man because that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicated that experience yeah yeah I could handle it now you would really yeah I could but you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat happened I'll do it if you want me to George uses like\nAll right I'll tell him All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh is it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me one night and said\nI saw that happening again and and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said how hurt my name is wrong because I notice that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that\nIt was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was mixed at that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know if\nAnybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nI completely
