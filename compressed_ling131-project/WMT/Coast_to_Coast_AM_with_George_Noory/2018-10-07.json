I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education living mistakes picture of education the way he was supposed to be Jimmy Carter but the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nA I forgot the name Seventy years old and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening Seventy still young you got plenty of time so do you favor or send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school there's no way they should be doing something like that private school they've got different rules would that would be ridiculous due due to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia is in Florida Hi Patricia what's going on\nHi how are you living the dream what's happening I'm I like\nTo think oh I can go on and what that movie coming out you know come up with a nephew weeks ago I called they can crack the gaming crap allies nice\nAnd I think that a Nancy Pelosi dying ... should be fired they should apologize camping on family and for the public\nAnd I think if they don't like it here and they can now get blown out they shipping port and\nNow having now I Know someone on the line so glad you can in the information yeah I have family in America got Bush for what you can only and that the Democrats felt blindsided get like little kids\nDon't get the way they go on their women but they were doing a lot in my cabinet or get from and how common it in the kitchen but we still are still coming in and help me clean and\nThat ... that race coordinator they haven't gotten away with much kind of evil horrible people and in fact by someone in my car\nWhich I appreciate you I'm not sure where to board them do but but and and don't hold your breath because none of those people are going to be apologizing in fact are dying and Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy and it had very little to do\nInterestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leaked or her office leaked about or receive lousy bored very little to do with that\nHer complaint was that he showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members are news anger you show that he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nOh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop I guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't have the temperament to be on the court when he was honestly emotionally reacting to people\nBreathing just family like crap people calling him a gang rapists he had every right to react the way that he did\nA dying Feinstein is all ... she knows that she is let me go back to and say Hi to Dan in Tampa Dan what's going on high\nHey Joel thanks for taking my call but I bet that's all I just want to make a comment and then I Want to get a question of it by you and all I Know\nAll right I'm at this level I think we've had it I think\nThe year that we've had a beyond that if they want to pick your president they want to make the whole people are tired of the math contradiction convoluted logic the same political correctness pseudo wide tension\nIt's all tied to turning thank God for that and I got a great president was the one who started this and put us on this show I or it I'm thankful for that you know um\nAnd I and I heard your last call and your great for doing what the diamond and still got my hope is a princess and Donald Trump junior for your list and those should be taking the mental from his father he should be running someday cause that\nHe's fired are definitely\nOh man I mean that great family that hey nothing but in\nThe waiting liberal hey back at what they did that family grateful just by everything that you know it's just absolutely disgraceful and you know what I'm getting them no way to get him in ... how will let them you can roll refrigerator Rodman doesn't matter you know when you\nGot and they're still going right down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that how do you think that what what would the impeachment process like what what ground we have or on the show because that's all they talk about\nThe left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will in fact the way you go in with\nTheir with their job or what the bill quite bill claim that he tried to call me to not investigate the wind anymore\nBill so that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that but those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the\nThe voters of his country have to realize if you vote for Democrats in November

origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's really scary and get said can I can get kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that where the sun was a little peanut characters that's the only sign with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you Zach Zach\nWe I was just such an offensive as like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year there was X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and I I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office\nX. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make just toss it the way I just\nWhole thing is just silly now my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it just so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... for ... of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirits store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nUh the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who are you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell ... ... us no good question you know I think that um you know ...\n... ... Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each ... each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night\nThere's the other like ours and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that there's a three in a sense about it I think it really appealing again it's not it's not east or it's like Christmas it's not high to a particular religion it's\nIt's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed I'm just like a dress up like a dress up right I mean it eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's something that is I think is inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for\nYou know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next uh in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr so who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... they'll be sort of you know actual ah you know where you got\nLike holographic oh you've got that lay the giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about the St panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm ... and this is will is leaving tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\nAh\nFor sure the airline which doesn't yet how the names won't start flying to twenty Twenty one man says the response to the jets used would end up benefiting other carriers Jessica ...

because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it it works with the will\nOf saline theme of ghost hunting so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it\nBut I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which\nYou know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabs her ... somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the role of you\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to Eighteen you know thou shalt not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in ah I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico and I was\nThere during investigation and looking to go to them and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said uh where did you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using a word you board was going to open up you know do you want and corals and whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rules are going to sign this don't use it and so you\nKnow typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Halloween this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations at W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nYou got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when\nIt came to Christmas and just lay allies right down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I assumed those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the real around the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face it last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nMember on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on the air now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the St panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go in to cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nDaniel SOS serving our seniors five mile walk and run will be held Saturday October twenty ... community church for additional information contact grace community church at three three seven three one died five seniors by pay run when the ...\nWeather turns bad turn to your official weather station six hundred W.

M. F. um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it uh\nAnd that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter]\nI think ... awesome if they're real\nAnd I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it well\nYou know um I I don't know it go for I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the ghost hunter unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on in\nThe it was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treating the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the dead that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because goes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I\nI don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual the debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nThe good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for getting the information\nYou had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get it to you but are coming up we're going to be talking they wear Wilson London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin ... hall Sinclair he's somebody you want to me out
