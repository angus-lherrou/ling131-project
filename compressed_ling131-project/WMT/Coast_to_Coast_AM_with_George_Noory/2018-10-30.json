what appeared to be a better job of it for us our family at the time and it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter]\nI'm working through the debt snowball and all my student loans [laughter] I think I pretty much burned myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training as skilled in such that I'm new at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's where I'm trying to figure out I've been reading books like crazy this last year\nBecause I'm passionate about um small business I have an entrepreneur heart and I still like working with people that work in the health care sector has just\nEating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to\nDo now is not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nCorrect um\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... a ... idea out there kind of old school\nHigh end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy\nRight you know like ... and the doctors got some of the doctor ... go to the ... year model right mhm correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they ... they did a different kind of

been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\nIn ... and let's say the U.S in Walgreens is just they're just stamping it out that's the ... world so right and

pull the lead up to the doctor because the docks along and I\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model because you've got an entrepreneurial itch to scratch that is some kind of ... low insurance no insurance\nA profit Gary model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable knowledge\nRight and that's not what you were burnt out on\nBurn out on the corporate crap right and uh and so is\nThere another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda\nFountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based\nIs booming middle grade product lines of services are not booming in any space those are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling right and so\nGet off on one into those spaces you figure it out the bottom and other commodities how spacious killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in under another year or two of the grind\nTo put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my

so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you\nKnow a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family just your time you're ...\n... my my morale\nOkay what's your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can I don't want my Morales bad if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing put money's cause I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as fertilizer to grow a crop\nTrue\nOkay you see the difference I if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't look past it in the last year and it destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I shared that chapter you know turn a new page yeah\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew you were only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z\nRight okay but you got to have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting\nIn you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so you got the right stuff do you just got to

and and face reality\nI'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWell let's listen here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because of the dying\nSo all and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we do not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean

populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born as adults\nThey're not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing now and it's this is a real number\nOn a five hundred million people that were born five hundred million and a half billion so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big income and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax you mean China is run attacks just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nThe ... the starting at about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well well it cooked himself because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly it they've got to support that can't support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nI put an end how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy\nThe first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing and that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come rolling in here for the guinea let's go to the ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman or I Want to teach you things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the foreign star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home and that little one but a young white include and his wife and we had a president did something so by all\nIt can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember Trump\nIt's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for non Stan\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win wars diplomacy doesn't save money we\nNeed a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense is is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people fall in love racist\nBecause God Knows what scientists hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's give give his comments day not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with anyone jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilets or pay the fair market value or even try to get in the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them smoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh\nDon't know I think what he has done his dignify but\nIt the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I\nMean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\n[noise]\n\nAlways keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.

B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of\nGaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building tonight and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's gonna spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island

if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it

definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing\nOf all things that was wearing a hat and uh it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she she said what what are you talking about big for\nI said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive and I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going and uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away\nFrom the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it

us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time list the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stores you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description tell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket um the title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm In a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the\nWidow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was home to me\nAnd he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay\nAnd uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it then then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of\nComforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but\nThis is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book so I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might\nBe a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky\nAnd that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple\nThat are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after\nSix weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine ah that's ah\nHunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is yeah it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had\nTwo full operation experiences and I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh it uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I\n...\nEastern I always
