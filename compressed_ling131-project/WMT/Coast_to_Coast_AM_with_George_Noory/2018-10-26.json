British resell standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that\nYou're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families do a little bit better there's a little bit more market for them and their as condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine in Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the choice I Would want to investigate because you are a planner the budget\nAnd um how they're doing with the H away budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right to waive fees to keep because they had to have a roof stinking thing was Lincoln all over the place\nExactly but that devalued the condo and book took cash out of everybody's pockets okay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserved for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know and you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so that is the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age are way reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... on a bunch of real estate I hate H always\nRight generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\n... they would drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nYeah I'm currently currently live and Martha is right now and I'm the president of ya [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] I say that our you know I\nI stayed at because I Want to run in a firefight kind of situation very very guy\n[laughter] okay [laughter] right well God you say you know that there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully you're not ... but yeah no no no no not at all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In one I joined the barrel suing each other and it's

Christian minister both\nWas driving a about eleven thirty five pm he's driving north and his home town of West ranch\nWent to his great amazement he saw a huge fireball come straight down out of the northern sky descending vertically estimates that it was about the size of a full moon and the night sky pretty sizable and the interesting thing about this there's several things about it\nIt had no tail and no ... no fragments from it\nAnd it had a bluish green glow coming from the bottom of it a very interesting report\nJust a few minutes ago I checked the American media society to see if they had recorded a meteor site in there and I cannot find one for the same time and date location so this must have been a very interesting site in those mice as my suspicion [noise]\nThree and a half hours later in Winston Salem North Carolina gentleman walked out on his balcony to have a smoke and he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him\nThere was a triangular crowd with orange and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object very interesting sighting after the first object Esau moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east\nAnd the second or two later you realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make that the morning sky this was six o five\nAm on Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October very interesting report and he's provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from Rockford, Illinois a woman reports that yesterday morning at six thirty seven AM she was driving to work she says she was going north on Ninety I think she was going west because the moon was in front of her she reports\nShe saw a rectangular object allegedly pass across the face of the moon very interesting she are citing lasted only five or ten seconds but I gave her enough time she says to get a good look at the object\nFinal report I'd like to share George comes from ... in Nebraska it's on a interstate eighty used to have a north Platte\nNebraska a gentleman was\nA report that he was standing out side looking at a clear night sky look into the northeast like the first report a ball of white light came down out of the northeast guy it apparently surprised him considerably\nIts streak toward Jim is made he estimates a Ninety degree turn to the west ... street to the west he estimates a thousand miles an hour although it's very difficult to estimate the actual speed of an object in the night sky\nAnd it suddenly turned down and disappeared from his site behind a building so a lot going on and all that the last report I've shared here are posted to

twenty sixteen I reported or files dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt in New York cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and us goes\nMuch further starting where that ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and fear Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests are brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to dwarf planet and the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great\nThat it's gravitational field pushes half a dozen other hyper belt object\nTo collector together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the ... territories in Hawaii defined planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven\nTimes more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this loose safe planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to the big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot\nThat is something like ... times further than map can a good way out there but they had narrowed down okay so yeah there were only going on November first started another surge because that new calculation\nPredict that planet nine is closer to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellation is up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date when you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when\nWe say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nOr not they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... when we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd ... that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly you're it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how the planet

hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat did it become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the IPC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline certainly\nThere will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low lectures\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get

been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel well\nJust a three weeks ago and October third I was doing updates on\nThree categories the first had to do with the\nVery distressing subject of half cats be headed cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem an air force base a that's down below this solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see the loop videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office\nAnd uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... I Do not know this is the extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none\nBut but I started receiving these emails and one came from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but\nWhat you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this if provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog\nIn my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn of the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature so\nAt the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired so after showering I got into bad it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what kind of was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bad coverage of all my show and just lay there and looked outside\nThe leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and ears open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty grade bomb drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was it\nAnd this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was

trying to share some of the more serious slices related to the issue of what might come back into this dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast audience\nAn example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication to the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I have been receiving and these various categories having to do with out of body\nOr what the fog is and here I Want to read this came\nJust a few minutes ago\nTo a coast to coast while writing this my\nFather was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still on the news do not live there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door into the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I\nSaw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends\nI Am an open minded conscious oriented person but immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color\nI would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person I have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house may have been more like the\nGross more roughly matter in its purest form I have never heard the words smoky fog until you offered them tonight and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a ... cat that\nI lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now I just keep wondering could it have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin who\nPassed about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body they gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she has survive\nUm my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you never know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this charge\nNo or something like that but these are magnificent stories and emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people objected similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can't\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah humor loopholes yes and the\nProfound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast\nI think it's going to be with at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question is it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it\nIs moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences\nI have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six\nDo remember an out of body because that is significant\nWhere was the learning\nThere was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul in a new body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you've got to make sure you follow up for this virus or you know children ... and yeah\nThe polio or something like the polio in November I

rolling in doping yes\nAnd people who have seen this and go to my earth files report look at the looped videos that I have\nOn the October through third or it may it's very clear a October third and then the second loop video is October Seventeen look at them look at the strange extraordinary thing twice that it's come to the office\nI have not felt anything negative I Do think that people who

so that was four dollars an hour to narrow the cost of production we predicted show on the rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts\nNine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown you know I guess not but consumer retired than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out solicitors so they can find out more about a hundred dollar sober\nWe do George or how to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the reporter the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even forms came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and\nThat in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip cool gas in nuclear combine let's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution\nCall now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nIt's so important to get a great night's sleep and I can get that with my sleep number bed\nIt really is comfortable is has a certain ... to it in mind is kept it Ninety which is nice for setting for me the new sleep number three sixty smart but also helps everyone from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through proven sleep quality it's so important to get that\nSo many couples disagree on mattress for him to sleep number beds let you choose your ideals burn this on each side so it's just right for both of you know the new beds are so smart they sent your every move and automatically adjust to you keeping you sleeping comfortably throughout the night", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "26"}
