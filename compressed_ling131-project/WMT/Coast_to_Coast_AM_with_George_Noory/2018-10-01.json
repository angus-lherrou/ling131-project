let's talk about treatment or their medications available that can help people\nYeah and I think that's a really great question of where it is medication fit in therapy and and what happens is when patients come in if they if they feel that alcohol is a problem and you offer them medication they say well what's the what's the medication going to do to me and the old days we had a aunt abuse or die so from that would make them vomit\nNow we have medications that can help track so and in a camp or say those are two medications worked through different mechanisms in what it essentially makes\nPatients who take it feel like is that it's just that the alcohol is not is reinforcing in when you change the drug use experience from\nConsume alcohol fuel high to consume alcohol feel nothing you are ... it's easier for you to extinguish that behavior so those are two drugs that we have available and they need to be wrapped in some sort of comprehensive program where you're also providing you know mutual help through you know suits and psychosocial support as well\nDoes medication like that work for other addictions like a food addiction\nIt's a great question to the extent that the other food addictions might be driven by an opioid mechanism to the way now trucks on for example works is it blocks the reinforcing effect of alcohol by blocking ... him you okay Wade receptor so it may it's a great question\nWhat should have a family member do or friends do if someone is struggling and needs help\nThis is the hardest thing we see in clinical practice right we have patients who come and what spouses or spouses a of a of our patients who in there and they're concerned about alcohol use\nUm obviously it's it's ... it becomes part of the family dynamic I think\nUm we obviously don't want to advocate that patients with himself in any danger but I think gentle suggestion or sometimes family interventions or you know professional counselors can be effective but really at the end of the day the alcohol use or what has to want to change\nThe nice thing is that some of the most effective treatment or these mutual help groups like a\nAnd those are easy to attend because they happen pretty much every day and every city\nSo I think that if um you know we ... it is a very hard thing but I Would say talk to your physicians talk to your you know um talk to your

asking me witness that missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... just going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA day but as you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film and\nMaybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nIn Georgia I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nOne to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations that I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and hopefully people see that you know hey if people are really\nReally good people the right to drag the fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are\nDown and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating\nAs heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stops searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people if you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching wind and there's been in for just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but ah it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they\nHad found disappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well\nShowers and storms are likely for our Monday in

uh during the break there that uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nThis is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro went on I mean there are metrics there are\nData um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there\nThey obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important so you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that truck\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps or another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nI go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child\nA child going to do for the next hour they said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit\nGet upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and your that your kid would run up hill nobody raised around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise]\nBut I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on oh yeah he's got a\nMinute we talked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was sunk face down and know the next morning unbelievably why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened is Martha couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have occasion the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne belly bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go watch six miles per hour\nA bunch of kids are going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and walk them their\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away\nYou know ... ... put them in the car and drove from there\nBut when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness not happening and when you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody\nAnd when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time ...\nAh in the new book uh it's law L. A.

inquisitive smart athletic brilliant\nSome people called her well I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and ask them for any documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports and they said uh we don't have any\nI said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under an all the articles in all the report said that they stayed at she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money she loved the outdoors hyped regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residents in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she has a really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he shoot he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nWhile in February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with\nA note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger smart smart thing to do exactly\nYou know I Wish everybody would do that but then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip\nAnd she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that are that Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nSeventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to smell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane a review of what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a Jay ... is\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations supervising ranger how cross of ... through our national monument\nAnd one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane let an eating man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports seen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nLines you guys yeah\nIt's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there's no source for the older\nWell here's what's as other members of the team\nGrabbed it as a very weird and scary so I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\n[noise] but uh\nAgain this was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note or where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty days search\nBoth of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no there's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is even read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon told me about that one\nSo this is the\nOne time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know I'm going to go against my own protocol I'm

about the air cases so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCain and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this Koester area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids uh went to California and it was a planned vacation well on Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the early\nEarly on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station at a Seventy third\nAvenue to twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got onto that I thought you know this seems kind of hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to Sam\nIn national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well\n[noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that crashed in disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents\nThat things which seems reasonable but when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared\nAnd that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specifics from the Nevada Triangle you wanted to get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nIt was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nOr in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they help a world's fair there was a man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old an infant Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the furloughed islands and Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol [noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for a person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them at ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field again stating that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the guard was near perfect condition both\nMotors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open and the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone\nThere was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor function and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy vote in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip\nAnd drop to wears on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds\nThey said all appear fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nI mean there's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nMind them ... and I just log on to ... am done\n\n\n\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that daily neighborhood\nThere was massive search off the coast went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio ... there was no call for help [noise]\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up and at the clouds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew and emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] your point\nNational park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that\nAre very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area and nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's one area that have just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said they they came up with some explanation for that\nTo me that we are laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or I mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories it doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach\nSo all these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I noticed that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to a base in\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for ... bucks it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of the stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the\nPentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it any ask a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomenon at the ranch and I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nThe idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\n\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\nShowers and storms are likely for

went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm gonna send me an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man a woman and a boy and a couple of other people walking one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around ab ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking with what's your name\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up there was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bumped them\nBut this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people

granite in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that after he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside this Boulder he guessed that made it for three days and then he said at the end of the third day it's\nAmount and that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of
