I got a Nineteen sixty about those rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do four but dual so for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but it is a project car I mean they you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a whole different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\nSo I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt at about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um\nI work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in ...\nOil and we are required basically it you you know for some of those business expenses during the trip that money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see you for that well we have to kind of that money I had the time um [noise]\nWe've closed all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we have money you know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been for the most of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover it hangs in the hotel mood and then you're you're going to get the money back then\nYou get the money back within thirty Dutch\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're ... we would hang that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... thing that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ... business\nTravel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back a little company you're taking a big risk sure yours or you're the bank or\nFor the small company that's too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nThey may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write write your company goes birds they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I'm going to end his Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that or does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would never do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips and why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollars right I don't ask\nMy people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me to pay back we just pay\nFor and we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're companies should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit card\nGonna make you how ... going to make your stomach because now you're realizing they're real\nRisk there is this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nMm\n[noise] Mm\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio

my new uh we were talking about the ... and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and end the dreams della uh most of the poor\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nLike on my news website over a ... that goes to I'm going to take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid\nAnd you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop your who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total in in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating the sticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of half has it has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians design the appearance with uh something called they called they said that which is the pyramid angle and it's a you know\nWhen you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount Ford and that's how the conceptual artist pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that is with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are sick or\nThat the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that uh the ... to ... I'm sure a shock to ... and ... published at Cape was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't al ... in the paper\nIt was a star ...\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation it didn't it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper and why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nGood Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... sign up to the ... stadium dot com [noise]\n\nFind\nFunny\nGuy\nLast night in Egypt [noise]\nNothing they raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age lists male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases muscle size and twice\nThe reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide the team to St Louis cardinals with eleven as we can Nineteen thirty three the Philadelphia Eagles play their first NFL game and lose the New York giants fifty six to nothing since then they've met hundreds of Seventy three times in New York leading the rivalry eighty six eighty five and two ties including last week when by the eagles\nThis week in Nineteen eighty three the Chicago Blackhawks in Toronto maple leafs combined says a fascist side golden NHL history eighty four seconds [noise] this week in Nineteen eighty eight and one of the most from\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of other media is a ... copy of the air quality rich and on his property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal helps introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more likely to go family care dot com that's family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nAt the peak challenged with feline herpes virus watched the vet spearheading this study we're laying a contrary Stevie em\nAnd Michael lap and TV M.

these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks is twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed\nAnd it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractions tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation us and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this these this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces\nAnd work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right right and then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven\nEight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example a course number Twenty one which is a it it that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted tower but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yeah yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy I'd\nWant to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ... yeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of\nThe lion and the use of the lion and go back ... tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go back a little tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which may go back to lead happy not an accident you\nKnow with this references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there man man and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry ...\nGo back great Cathy

M. T. [noise]\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot to do and the paramount thanks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring of ... and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a\nRemote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\n... yes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked\n'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern be construction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section and then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nA menu alien um they are basically re creating these ah ah ah I ... in the in the virtual world and I predict in a few years you'll be able to\nAh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth and so\nAnd I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat has access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public can take my answer on the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there are now with you regarding\nTalked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is it ... was was a job of director their\nKey I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved a ... at these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed back you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back down\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot and was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA say and they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this is coast to coast am more minute when we come

believe a lot of the shows are are doing this for quite a so uh [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I said well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is uh the origin of

which is of course ... ... to ... years ago or ... or ... as the you know we're talking about a quiet of wait for ... years ago\n... older than any other language you can put it in the fall of Harlem

the ... ... you know heightened ... ... or the world\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thank you for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite thanks for in terms I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so you're saying that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use so\nThat term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I said I've read about this\nBefore but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we're ... we're going back to a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right like ... and\nMen is uh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another uh uh I\nHave research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what king was called I can tell you that a\nFire that fits dynasty the king at five different title um and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was for Islam or an hors ...\nOr so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a next to invent which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came the lady's name ah you know and then can the cartoonish name later um but uh as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was

you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nI think the blueprint for the great pyramid isn't coated in the ... of him you know are numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dean in doses are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah\nUm\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological ah with an alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believed that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is would do not not the top top but there'll be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined ed row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so\nHow big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe\nNo more than five feet something like that five feet by eight and hide I'm saying rising oh\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that um and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen chamber\nSo I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new ones can show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but uh they might not be stocked up um they could be\nYou know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Donnan buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they've made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to a forum ... studies it seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any as excavations or\nRight right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive\nA
