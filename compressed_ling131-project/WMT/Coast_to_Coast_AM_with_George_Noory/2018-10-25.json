{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Okay well I think you're already preparing yourself for your financial futures Seventeen years old you actually know the day brings you show exist go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game of most people so you know what to do and and and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good\nThings not necessarily win money but but and he's probably got some good traits that you do have a really Kate and carry forward\nUm so uh um well the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry him around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're gonna have to handle your own a school\nA ... and you know on your show you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as you go now as far as him um there's not many\nMen on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the men to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\nShow what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life uh particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely our pastor in the past there have tried helping them in the past but it seems like no matter who's talking to 'em or what or how they're trying to help him he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and he's very stubborn and being his own man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pasture again I'm ... you know I\nI find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I found people every day who\nTwo years ago ... wouldn't listen but now they list a five hundred years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and and I think\nI'm most pastors if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and pushed on your data on this subject\nAnd not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYou can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut\nDown you're not going to make things worse very true yeah 'cause he's gonna go he's going to do whatever he wants to do and then uh you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you have to be real\nI was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I Would just say this summer and I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business or something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat [laughter] that doesn't work\nRight that's insulting yeah fall on me and so you know instead you would just say I'm just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust yes kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on the outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening to anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um incompetence and this one area of his life and I'm just going to be more is it's all I can do\nAnd are you may you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this\nAnd and show your love is not conditional upon you know whether he handles money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not going to take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing hair 'cause I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nYou shouldn't have any even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind their joy hey thanks for calling in ... open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how are you\nI I Am doing slightly better than out of there and working on getting better good how can I help\n[laughter] oh I just wanted to say first off I'm a lifelong list or ... thanks to my mother and my grandmother always playing you in the car when I was a kid wow at a now pay you as an adult have not always practiced as good as I should have but I'm working on that that was gotcha how can I help today\n[noise] ah well I'm calling to ask about that but I'm working on hang 'em up like Maggie I started at ... work Seventy hours a week and actually deliver pizzas specifically\nOkay I have called the office to make an offer on the debt they have given me a counter offer ... Seventy five percent of the balance which I Know is a little high that never had anybody hurt anybody asked you about\nA debt over a judgment on an addiction which is what this is over mhm no I understand that might be a little different yeah it is but they have ... used to give me a written agreement on them\nOkay um so I don't even if you were to brown them a check they will not ...\nTo an agreement a he said if I come in to their office I Will get a receipt but they will not give me I have an agreement before hand\nThat's fun that's fun but it didn't get a receipt I get a a a statement that says this judgment ... this is this a victory in debt is one hundred percent clear it upon this payment not ever seen that as you pay the money a receipt to says you paid money doesn't mean that you paid Seventy five percent you're still owe twenty five percent\nOr what he said it is it would be a he called and they were the but also saying that that's what would be sent to the county clerk or to mark that it is ...\n... as long as you have something in your hand that says the debt is settled in full and it's in writing you would not you'll be fine okay so at least Seventy five percent on an old eviction that it sounds to me like you're dealing with an individual landlord not a corporate landlord\nI'm dealing with a law office that has representing the no ... yeah you probably got about all you're going to get [noise] how could affect\nThe UN and I'm willing to pay that amount that you know totally fine go go in there and pay 'em and get her done you know but get it in writing and says the dead is settled in full this payment means are no longer only money and it needs to say that real clearly were you understand it and you can see it or don't\nGive them a track and um you know that's that's how it works and I know that ... you don't let them loose that Iran's show and\nTake guys this is James child producer of the Dave Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now

need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then\nYou know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this is a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media not not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely 'cause George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you\nKnow just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that ... packaging exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the

to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one\nBut I Am convinced and our law enforcement uh individuals and individuals and institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nI Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left\nThat did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut up way let the intelligence officials doing their job\nThen wants their job is completed and they determine who's done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most fix more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a

... that you cannot get rid of the certain spirit that are just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nBoundary and wanted me by magicians\nWhich were really on edition or a group that\nI Know I'm Sorry and clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth bounce spirit and what they do is they will go and I'm\nLooking for spirits at the cemetery who have an

the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to Olympic demand on\nEr and yes you are and we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and ... of January November and December I Can't believe it too much about going anywhere\nAgainst my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell ya ... we'd love\nYour standard I going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nA at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this there's not going to be overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time\nSo I took by Sony tape recorder out I went ... interviewed Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known them ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny in Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out areas had there might be eight thousand prices and the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word gap looks like they're about one point six planets for star\nOpera galaxy star in our galaxy the Milky Way how a hundred billion store\nAll that many one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around\nWe're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know getting here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we realize I look we're fusion for example ... you\nCan get ... hours\nWe also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right can't be too late beings around you know well it was on for a little bit four billion be seeing this\nJust a little off the list uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate too you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of spontaneous\nGeneration of life everywhere or migration colonization I mean people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throws a climate that they\nPut in incarcerated people you know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people it's it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on the wall we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there are life out there and we see it\n... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr were still slapped [laughter] and\nAnd so uh ... mostly wants to learn that if it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number all or no [laughter] no and so we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget unemployment for about a trillion dollars this year\nSo we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll be\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work uh we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is I'm not going to try to explain why or how much we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know come to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get

and exercises and was for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot ... from ... from owning a I'm a retired police officer in white all New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six\nAt a ... year face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life\nAnd I'm actually going to be going to see that individual NY whole New York very soon as names officer buying golf one and so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nAnd ... you for already endorsing the book yes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about\nMy own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nI absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Harter\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer got one\nAnd went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and that I've had dialogue with officer guzzling fence and\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present\nAnd then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature and the area\n[noise] some people believe the big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the UFOs or I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical eight now or if you're reading things like of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book the

types of friends\nAnd I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax\nThen perhaps\nThis creature may take one step\nBefore it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators were eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think of the old Patterson so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] Mm I don't know it ... I'll say this though if that was a fake it was a darn good one\nA darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think that would be gargantuan to fit in to that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer than ... in my opinion what human arms would look like\nSo it is very compelling\nWhen with Bill bean bills website is now linked up at ... dot com being dot net for you he was the second person behind the secret door I did not get it right so I'm One for one so far\nGosh ... he was right at the tip of my tongue I just couldn't put it together\nWhat I said Baltimore I thought for sure you were going to know\nThat was close that almost did it [laughter] and I just darn good job good job\nWell Tom tom and I had a I was going to do a little different voice for his suggestion but I just couldn't get my voice to go there so I had to go in a different direction or just seconds before we\nCame [laughter] so you have also investigated it by the way when we take calls will take big foot ... everything that you you're talking about you investigated what is called the men della effect yeah did this is bizarre gimme gimme your definition of what that is\nWell I didn't know anything to a couple of years to a lady in Scotland\nAnd I'd performed a deliverance over her and she had contacted me a couple of weeks later and asked me if I knew about this for men della fact in and these changes and specific changes in the king James Bible and I said no I have not and she sent this video\nAnd I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this suggest sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just said watch this and I watched the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nDrug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why ... see I've always thought of it is that we're going to come back with more built in a moment on coast to coast am your phone calls with Bill being big court and the Mandela back do\nYou have a photo that you think would interest that goes to goes to audience were always on the hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to coast to coast am dot com and most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you see the submission Amish [noise]\nDaniel soul and volunteer firefighters dance will be held on Saturday Night November third from eating until midnight episode on American Legion on main street music provided by Adam key admission five dollars at the door\nJoined the University of Iowa dance marathon pediatric Cancer Center for the miles in the may ... five ... fun run on Saturday November third at twenty seven eighty front street northeastern north liberty take 'em run through a corn based pumpkin patch and the fall scenery to benefit the University of Iowa dance marathon for more info go to the guy was ... dot com\nAlways keeping an eye on what the weather is going to do six hundred W.

nation\nThat was the one the car by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat's strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other and the power and there was another in the past there was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife began that car as well because supposedly governor Connelly with its head off with one of the sports\nWell no you're right the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where was a were was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with in front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\nThe but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third world a third\nStreet there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um\nWith Connelly and his wife\n... were you when you know them well you said you don't buy the con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he bought but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president uh that's the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAt so the so governor calmly and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been a now they're sitting there and\nAndy Dr early or any\nOther Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you do too much to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime in a you tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what are you just described Kennedy back with his wife right and a hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film right now I hear you [noise] and uh and then I ... I don't see a third row of seats\nI didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either bell thanks top okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was your Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor primary and his wife and his wife was two years left and the president at Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt straight I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was in the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again now think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is one was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had to have been left and that if that's the case and also [noise]\nJeeze driving so that means he'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with this last pan\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I don't buy that\nOne every with Bill thanks for being behind the secret door you've given us a lot to think about when the new book comes out get back on the program for a full show up next one more guest behind the secret doors\nTo find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nOn my heart radio\nPackages subject Callahan Fox News\nThe FBI confirming little parcels that the congresswoman Maxine Waters that are also in California in LA mail facility on lockdown Wednesday night because it closely resembled suspicious packages found earlier Wednesday a total of seven of the phone mail to leading Democrats in the offices of CNN\nAt eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four\nThat's eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four\nSix hundred WMD T.

George Parker Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers you're right did I Know it's got to where you have you been Karen\nI have been doing great Georgia how about you and I'm great together we just didn't act like\nColor everything sure enough for people who need to know who you are Karen ... is the ... board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we we did what little tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things ... boards\nMarla a more ... believes the you're the greatest ... personal author\nWell she's very ... let's say it that way she's very kind\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves Luigi board folks as you know I'm opposed to it on and want to use it but Karen feels very secure with a I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nIn order to have to do with the use your your intentions that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWhat people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself within the world for me if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light or the place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the world changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will leave and that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength within and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system\nKinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating in communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different at somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's\nReally similar principle you have your attention that you use it only as a tool you have there's no hidden spirits and view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ... [noise] no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that me once and the more and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were costing the board\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm like standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board\nOn our dog had going\nGood and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything\nThat's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it than just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plant ya urine is at the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving well let me answer that\nFrom a few different directions one as many people believe is India motor effect which really basically means your mind as controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles through the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or mid ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back\nTo the Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut them moving spell out messages\nTo Beijing worked with an inch and really absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when\nYou come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like Tunisia frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plan to move and for for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half worth ... your questions and maybe you're we'd you board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though Karen to put somebody down if they don't like the ... board that I appreciate it\nWell I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness and this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness OSHA and I'm not for\nThat I'm for having a discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions this tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool this kind of floor or a different one so I think it's great to become together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group that talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff with all of us believe it doesn't work some of some of his leaves it works because if you didn't motor and a few of us might believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nHaunted the board start in in ... how long ago\nWill this there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando it has termed ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um he turns it we just dishes because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece that\nIs not true there is a different detonation tool that started back then the first board that we have a we have an understanding that because we have history\nAnd a chance of showers Sunday with the highest fifty rainfall will remain on the light side and there will be plenty
