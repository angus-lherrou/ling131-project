W. I.

I was just curious if I can tell what the health savings account shut eye where should I say that as like a\nOh my ... my emergency fund and we have three small children and you know they get sick they break them\nLike they're ... you know [laughter] yeah um yeah we wish we spent some time with staples in the emergency room with our kids as part of growing up but um I think it is anyway there was a ... [laughter] but uh so uh yeah\nI Would use your ... your H aside to pay medical bills with and there's two reasons\nIf you take a thousand dollars home and pay taxes on it it turns into seven hundred dollars and then you pay medical bills with that if you put it into your age ... say the whole one thousand can go towards your medical bills such as if the government pay three hundred out of every thousand for you\n... by running any medical expenses through the ... say and um and you can always go back later add more to it when you get further along and you get out of debt build up my emergency fund baby steps plan but for right now I think you're on to something I Will how much is in the ... say\nI'm right now they only a hundred\nAnd how much in medical bills to your hands\nOn guy came out\nOkay so it's not going to wipe it out or anything you're still yeah I you know that's six hundred bucks is a tax free methodology to pay your bills or medical bills and any other money you can dump into that I just say through payroll docked loaded up and run it back out to pay that other ten thousand because you're saving thirty cents on the dollar\nUm okay so I was under the impression that I couldn't hear are a check for males that we acquired when we have a\nCall now that may be true yeah okay yeah so it would have to be something that came up after that but now you can you can ... you need to double check that out I think you're right but I'm not I'm not an expert on that part I could give you a wrong answer and you need a better\nAnswer that in mind because I could screw this up but I I ... I think you're right though but I Would double check it 'cause there's some money on the line you know [noise]\nBut anything any medical bill you can run through that age as I was going to save you roughly thirty cents on the dollar and so anything that does qualify I Would do that and there's no question about it a good question I give her joining us with Russia and having used a new listeners [laughter] Mm not about this particular our in the book\nOr something to drink jobs like dumpsters our senior executive producer and killing Daniels Russia Russia and phones Springer I'm Dave Ramsey your [noise]\nTell you we\nYou guys hear me say all the time\nThat if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to\nWritten by number one national best selling author Kris Hogan his book is based on the largest study ever done what ten\nThousand millionaires and the results will shock you you will learn the real truth about what it takes to become a millionaire\nIt doesn't matter where you came from it matters where you're going today you can pre order everyday millionaires for only twenty dollars and get over fifty dollars and free bonus items the bonus items include the everyday millionaires audio book any book a video lesson for me called it's okay to be wealthy\nAnd the video lesson from ... called how to retire inspired pre order every day millionaires Dave Ramsey dot com or call us at AAA twenty to peace\n[noise] these these news radio six hundred down when you empty Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors and and ... and not based on the lower due process but just on sort of emotional mopping\nAnd that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very places you know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the\nThe way I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats you you better not get power because you can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population increasingly allowed them to be weaponized so you know the reality is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to church and according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think that Kevin what it's going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderate filled out it's because if you you know if you do have dive into his record what it says he he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment and the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the lawn and help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to get something\nThe moderate you know problems and so that might get he he's going to be confirmed probably it's weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election um and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know and it's tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talk ... support the violation if process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we have a responsibility under the constitution the law\nTo to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people ... ... and we would have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law\nAnd it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me so we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um\nYou know I think I think that a lot of people uh\nYou know who is allowed themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah oh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress those American apology\nWe shall see how this all on small gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

California who simply says I'm older than George\nThank you for taking my call them you going to movies anymore\nI'm older than Santa Claus so I mean it's a and you know it oh last time I was in a movie theater was Thirty years ago and\nThat's when you saw John Wilkes booth to jump from the theater\nNow there you go exactly I\nAnd I'm a lady that I was dating when they want\nTo see a movie on the spur of the moment has had a multiplex but it was sold out and so um we asked what other movies were available and um we went to see\nJohn carpenter's they pull out while we sat through that movie twice that night and um the lady I was dating was scared\nOut of her mind of a month [laughter] I was just I mean my jaw drop\nDid she at least holds your hand in Griffith\nYeah yeah absolutely she\nJust was I called that intelligent horror and this is the question I wanted to bring to Mr logo\nYeah Saddam they're drawing earners they live excellent so by the way big big fan of that movie Nineteen eighty eight and there's the or the special Hofmann lenses that allow you to see the strings that are being polled behind a what we think is real life\nOh yeah and the acting Keith ... and ... rotting popper ... was a fantastic I mean they just are in the\nSun glasses ... eat that garbage can\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I really wanted\nTo ask you about Mr ... was um there's another director of intelligent horror and that's Canadian director David ... bird and um scanners\nI'm One of my favorites was video Jerome with James Woods he's telling other movies naked launch exist stance\nA high [noise] and it's our video drama is a good example of a movie that's\nYou know virtual reality gone hey wire type of thing and hallucinated Jenike but I'm Conan Bert creeps up on me you know as you watch a movie by him and I was wondering if you want to comment on made it just seems like all about\nMoving over all of his you know I've heard the term body horror uh associated with his film and a lot of them all kind of have to do there's a physicality to everything where\nWhere it's getting inside of a certain part of sorts in our body and I think that they're they're they're I think that's the ultimate intrusion you know I think that's the ultimate ah a violation you know and I think that he really uses that even in the fly I mean he's just falling apart in the fly\nA the Jeff Goldblum fly from the ADA I'm also from eighty a like a like they live but um you know I mean it's it's a really um you know he ... a day and he and his attention to detail as amazing as always great makeup of sex\nAnd uh you know David ... is one of a I I I Would agree with you one of the most intelligent directors where a he almost had John Rocker himself his his movies are kind of all go together and and they have the same theme coming back again and again\nLet's go to Frank and Hollywood, Maryland welcome to the program have Frank how are ya\nHow do you have to be back with you know you're you're out your ... your won by people who make this a coast to coast the exercising next door which it is I'm Sorry oh\nWest you why would you say such wise but\nThank you I'm Seventy years old and I want to ask your question a lot of hail which you're limited to was the one of the scariest movie that I used to look I look at it from my fingers\nYeah hours scared he is what I call laughing at it they got used to get over here are some people benefit package to give us the movies I'm Bad at the same time it came out in the theater\nYeah wow that's nice that's a good question about uh Vincent Price Israel are we in between I was on the hill\nAnd do all the tell tale heart which is your job place that really I was six months or so why did he do in between those two films what did he do in between um the uh uh when they come out good idea about it\nUh well let me think here will how house on hunting\nHill Nineteen fifty nine\nFifty nine he probably did the Tingler probably right after a writer right around ... ... what would you ... you have the same color on the [laughter] let me see if I go into another William Castle and I think that was maybe right out here\nI Am I wrong about that the anger I don't know I Would put the finger in there and then he did a lot of these\nUh ... films with Roger Corman with the the Edgar Allan Poe films um and you know he did a mascot I read that and uh he's a pittance handle a lot of ground post ... films for Roger Corman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre flying through the audience that touching people and and uh uh we had um\nA you know all kinds of gimmicks nurses in attendance and uh you know prize giveaways and I'm\nA ... a lot of corny stuff uh but those shows used for a while they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are four walling they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an AK ... and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out maybe have ... and asked him\nGhosts made out of a mumps that were ... phosphorus in\nAnd they would they would uh you know they would have these chains that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they would ... them back and forth and it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would put the they were put weird stream and ice water and\nThrow them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people's shirts and people will be feeling this cold noodle going down the back of their shirt\nYou know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks\nThese guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician and by show act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nA job so lovely absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen a you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a nod he saying that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a performance that goes along with the movie performing very very different markets all over the country\nAnd it over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas we go Robert's with us on coast to coast hey Robert go ahead sir\nGood morning George and Mr Lovell either thinking would call and I'm sure enjoy the show thank you I'm\nI'm sixty one years old and I haven't been to a theater since about ... years ago when I went to see a rush the ... the\nCanadian band they're dom okay interesting do you get a couple of

movie I ever saw Frank Sinatra him was the ... century in Canada Day\nHe did well there you did very well very well that was a fantastic it was a pretty good actor\nHe really was it really is in that um that just sent so many twists in it that you didn't know about out a way but as far as the phone diabolical\nAnyway one other thing oh who ... horror movies that really scares me and I know now that he's still alive to see one occasionally\nOkay and they're not my favorite\nBut I was about ten years old and my grandmother's house everybody was in bed and I had to turn the TV them very low leaves lay on the floor of about two feet from it it would be able to hear it so everybody was really you know it was called black Sunday\nOh yes with Boris Carl off\nMax and right I remember them what was the one called Black Christmas or something like that\nThere was Black Christmas a with a ... that was a Bob Clark who went on to direct a Christmas Story of both but why Christmas uh there was a a a a a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house\nAnd she he was calling them from inside the house\nOh ah that's where we'll be that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film a really well made structured horror film John facts and it's amazing in it and it's um uh the template for a lot of those kind of movies from the seventies\nAnd like I said that guy went on to make corky [laughter] you went on to make a Christmas Story or a lot or a lot of other films and different genres\nBut somebody will some of these movies Mr ... are are creepy they're not pure horror but through creepy there was one with a a Beau Bridges I Believe yeah in his ... his wife went into a fast food place or like a like a quick shop\nA and never came back out he couldn't find her and apparently\nA truck driver had kidnapped or um and I was just really well done movie and you know you\nKnow I'm not that I you know it sounds that sounds familiar\nAnd they buried they ended up burying him a because the you know the trucks Arbor says do you want to know what happened to your wife do you really want to know and they knocked him out it was called the vanishing\nOkay yeah yeah I've heard of it I don't know ...\nWas a Beau Bridges your keys or sell Sutherland\nThey I think they were both on the ... you know it was good stuff but Mr

has changed periodically through history and\nThat was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led
