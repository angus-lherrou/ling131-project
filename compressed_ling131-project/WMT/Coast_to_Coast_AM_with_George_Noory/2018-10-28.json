place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but\nThis is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is ... allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nThat not run for your life [noise] ah\nAll because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nUp people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come I ask you that\nIn the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's a clear your graphic pattern and the murders if want occurred just south of Portland the ... just north of or a month or so that that would be a a link between them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve blood the in Nineteen eighty Ninety eight now and knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is they um\nUh the uh\nBy Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had been achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms but uh it was it was a very slow process and it is a very infant tile stage\n[noise] mentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... other things to try to find\nA lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the Dodgers had human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes\nWe were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen\nEleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crimes we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this in Nineteen ... eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow we don't get noted walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got an edge that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are heavy I had told\nMy daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years I mean the out and start a series of crimes\nHe would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we would just fantastically lucky and it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so ah we\nIt's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this was ham and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crush right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successfully after that um it is is the years went forward and yet\n... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the\nTime after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house\nWas shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something but he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um and that was not what he was trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed\nAnd anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me\nI don't know you but they they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime by by the way at the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader\nA it's a book by I'm Beth wind stuff a lot of weight with Weinstein I could have a lifetime\nOr the or I think I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there was surely going to be his\nHand and one of the things I learned from reading at the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories\nBecause the ... what I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people trying to do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories that just were picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed and coast to coast am Suzie and\nWe walk\nA rock and roll lovers Danny western take a journey back to this week in rock and roll history back in Nineteen sixty six where the screens became the

feel truly blessed and partying with my money has never been much of a problem just asked my accountant singer outfit Robbie Williams and the oasis rather there's you're back\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that I\n[noise] you're you're fading out I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no can have that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime that night\n[noise] [noise] yeah they are uh I was saying the crime stories are as name to it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nIn the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got hooked like a fish or I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and below Scott Iowa called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious that the ... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's\nThe interesting thing is to is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers diminished or is that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution\nThen we try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her death and became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they say that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of the crime engine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it\nAnd he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct\nYeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy you said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different\nBut uh it it's still that have that reaction to it\nYou can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is\nIs trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was really a watery or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people in urban areas\nToday thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that\nHappened ... who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they look bad parable Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a ...\nAt what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way that houses were constructed route communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's one incident that always sticks with me that illustrate the point you're just back there\nAnd that has to do with the the soccer in the case of soccer and then that it uh one of them I think it was sock oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right\nThat would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of a ... of the way the entire American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise] except that it's important to them a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively to ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska\nDue to a um a dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete

author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you so\nSorry I got the wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of an entire family and what a bad as it is a rare that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nThe circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise] so somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep recreating that until they break the habit I'm so practical theory ... whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to think so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not\nTerribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was or his secret it was it was the most thrilling and the most exciting thing that has ever happened to them\nAnd that he was simply recreating at the um\nUh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as he got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime that's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's that's who he was a that's a Italian new himself I I don't doubt\nThat Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse says young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrageous not that is in any sense of justification for what he\nBut I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've thought of this\nCould have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book has a lot of things we don't know about a year or have you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative after it's up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nPreparation for the about ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much which respect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he says he ... is is the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents driven about his life\nThe uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the tone in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do is to whether it's just one person who was the victim of the ... rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know the it it's a ... thing and and the they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first release came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um [noise] it it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear ... known norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... the ... from the trade is that\nFrom his crime is it ... it was not even not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller them after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what that James's mess they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nAh this this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity so we moved\nOn in front of the book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also [laughter] so it's quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw in a strange question about the Boston sprinkler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give me the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... am done\n[noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg\nThis week's top Stevie stream\nHere's what you've been watching on TV this week tiny thing that is the latest found that river ... theories taking place in three this is actually underway and ... lantern number for\nGood grief is the newest Halloween like on ABC's Modern Family they have a certain place this week [noise] Mexican number which the everyday angel of Grey's Anatomy\nAnd finally Halloween season it wouldn't be complete without some TV scares American horror story apocalypse ... names you're number ... ...

Green Bay or something and and\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night you know eighty started just morally more or less trapping it became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and kind of transition to just\nRunning loose across the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know it's him as the lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a hit he he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery and and\nIt yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the handle and you know drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would it would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crime he just drop the accent left his money fingerprints on the on the acts\nUp mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle the acts in a bucket of water before leaving at the end the crime they did that and let's get it every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers knew what was going on or\nSee a but it just dropped the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nConnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected him to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that that that still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean that there's any occupation where somebody could walk into the next day would be either like\nFirefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up um\nBut they all ... among them or did he work as a matter but then there are some of the I think he did at the accidents\nThat he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an axe that was found in would pile almost all of the
