term effects what's the prevention and most important what's the treatment to this infection\nWell that's good it's scary though Gary why does it affect just children apparently among it\nMay it may be a because the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children are very hard and put a lot of mental hospital and they noticed an association between severe respiratory infection engine children and um the acute flash of paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after of acute respiratory infection\nOr the children

see with us a rod Serling in his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out and color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately you what was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say oh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell never a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the\nClosest the ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're gonna ear and\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows the to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nSure was in a lot of people still\nStill don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling or through the gecko credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what can you really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was that gallery twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you\nKnow the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was she didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine as commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story and twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know\nIt's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably is is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that in the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic uh\nIs yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's ever [laughter]\nAnd they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that they think just taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with

for it by the by\nI don't know I don't not till I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a somewhere in the neighborhood of you know two hundred thousand dollars oh yeah oh\nI had al ... lines I had mental saying Willie Mays I haven't had 'em all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nWith the duplicates in generally your head like I had seen Pete Rose rookie card\nSo I ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles or ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much it probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right where everybody's on the baseball cards saying nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nEyeing football ... interesting to write basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got oh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today\nJeeze basketball card but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think through where homeowners Wagner card was worth
