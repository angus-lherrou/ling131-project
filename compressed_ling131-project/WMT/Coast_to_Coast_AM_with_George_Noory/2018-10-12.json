I didn't have to do it though [noise] uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than I deserve they hire you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay they saw it for its own do at the beginning of this year I impulse and purchased they ridiculous\nCar [laughter] and then I found you I was like crap [laughter] what'd you bought\nWe bought a two thousand fencing most let's fix with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah well not for free 'cause my ... yeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay oh yeah so what what are you on the shoulder thing we'll thirty ...\nThe other mhm okay and what's your house and I'm\nHere will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah there's this you know\nSo that and I'm next year I'll be getting into a Fifteen Percent right plus the fact that ran down the road yeah I'm so here's my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with is a Nemo I finally agreed to let it go good and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand\nOh God yeah so you're you're all ... down into it or die that bad yeah\nAnd I that that it only took like three months\nGood lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private fail\nSomething that that's not enough of a spread on private so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand to twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically over forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had a extending warranty yeah and and we found out that it's funny how when you pay off a vehicle or he reached ... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and ... ... ... you or did it\nThe cars one of our old\n... and I almost a year old yeah\nAll right oh yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance or me and my wife is looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money and I already have it by next income refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the hub throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have stood among and assuming payments like one sixty eight but almost done with that and we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled and defense and go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars\nAnd just make payments off for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making the math\nMhm yeah I mean to be okay with that yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing your second car the ... of the uh the\nFive thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nI'll just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that car paid off and then getting the whole that you've dug with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing just drop that foreign value um make real sure you got your numbers right on that because I I mean I [noise] the\nCars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a car guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that is incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you maybe you haven't lost as much I'm hoping you have a lot of so much as you think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further than you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able get five hundred more out of showing it probably sell than you would for a dealer on something bad expensive\nUm so I really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow what a dad gummed kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing and good luck with it\nBut yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing that is good and the story thanks for the call [noise]\nSo that was this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books things were hanging out with is America's James Childs is our producer ... is our associate producer and phone screener I'm Dave Ramsey are hosting\nAnd we'll be back\n[noise]\n\n[noise] Mm\nThis is James child producer of the day randomly show I'm excited to announce the we're now in theory twenty six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you tend to ... dot com slash show\n\n[noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents and the country that is why many of our listeners have success with any lp\nRichard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today that it is refreshing to find someone like your E.

George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been the sport but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed country to\nJapan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be has to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging they\nAlso tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise] so so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand and eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nA head of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up

officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to beat each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance and ... and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies\nUh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of

R. dot com\nBut I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because\nI when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts they're\nGoing to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is\nThat they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing and the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nSounds in one way to bail out everything would be people like a hundred thousand dollar voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did\nJust to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on a permanent\nQuantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted to volunteer as opposed to check because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you're making it and just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to ... money or pull accounts they're gonna do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the ...\nMoney center banks so I'd much rather have my money and credit union than you know bank of America Wells Fargo or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOr tell you okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I just answered that part of one of my question I asked\nA direct to my mind when you can read and write apart and why why um I did not act on it quite a few more weight on your point\nRight yup they put all about timing\nIt's all about timing what am I garden in a moment I call it I'm hearing what I've heard of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance does agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are ensure they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYes you're going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people going to hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say\nHave as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were out of time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next\nA psychiatrist looks at the paranormal\n\n\n\n\nAnd now I look back at this week in history this

with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations is well welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died from any time you know when my book to but it's not my first came out many people asked me if the based on stories with my patients had told me\nMy aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the documents confidential adopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that the doctor should not be paid anything Kobe patience and I don't see the material in my book based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and to my audience and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experience I think it is related to the fact that I had some close how's that for many veterans that [noise] um you know\nIf you've got a lot of ... about the near death experience mhm\nBut the um\nNear death experience you know it's quite by Dr ... moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago now I think he estimated\nThat something like one in thirty Americans is either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had the classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual\nThe first um couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young\nAnd I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeeze\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] well that's one way of doing it that the uh the um anonymous themselves don't know it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nThis worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia rude gee I'm\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... he was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\n[noise] so he was flown back into the don't you send in Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen if you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here altruism you know he said the way it came about was um\n[noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah ... ... to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche out your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist\n[noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she may talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs or belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and nice to have these experiences while as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or\nPre cognitive beams and other things we've talked about such as visions of voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP and collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example\nSomeone phones you and you were thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about you write was that's very\nCommon um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than the others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nGo to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded

many let's talk a little bit about the deathbed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nIs dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages in dreams which on cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that\nCould have been her fear\nYou know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and\nI think that's possible although we don't really know and and how how would we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams because I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought\nI I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who plays also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their permission stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they'd disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nThere's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard dry so she was ... horse racing ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's going to win the race would do that on that horse spent on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no she was a he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered they knew they couldn't find where she put his dentures and he wanted his teeth back\nRight you have you back but\nThen then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were well yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat have you learned many about\nAll of this what do you think it is [noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that you do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's ... and I think it's very true\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these ... these nominate some people call them fake and people of the paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or Mexico their mysterious is relative or it's being used to describe the same event\nBut I think paranormal you then and have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every parent normally then but some do of course it depends on the ... having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\n[noise] do you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't have to live our teen nine to five eight and a day to day life that if something more than we don't really know about and I think a chicken but\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make is we're

psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the psychic from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be found if machinery and in\nFact it may be more than one voice\nTo hear the voices talking to each other about the person\nThe voices might be an accusatory or threatening where I'm psychic hallucinations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with fake ...\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing a voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis the major mental disorder which affects the ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other him aside from the of the nation for example ... or paranoid idea ...\nOr you know feelings have ...\nThat you played talking about and that type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened and if a psychologist that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patient while they were patients they were actors pretending to be ...\nBut they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the war they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patient me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their parents their behavior that conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them completely normal so that they can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes make mistakes well that's true but but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the Asians live with it they they know the honest so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said\nAll right let's take some calls for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting\nAnd waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot of bomb grade I have been a mistake and that had visions all my life and I had that many many near death experiences where I've let my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me it's when I went to London and then they go and I saw a picture of the war room where they get all the major planning for their European\nCrunch ... well that's\nWhere I used to go and out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up
