yesterday [laughter] amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... into the mess out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of ... era I developed the seven foot with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you well if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat though if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samson pay\nA lot of farmers market I bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they

done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age\nTo have this type of business at command something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay\nAnd so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore\nAnd so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent one told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown\nThat whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap\nAnd there'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call it which is the goal of all businesses people out of more money than I thought I explained to her I said so you know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know\nAnd you know and then trying to get a they even knew you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry or whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent of just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent see if anybody says anything\nSo I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I said so out of work out she goes oh\nMy gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty per se but the ... isn't that different though because that

because people like you keep ... okay but here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a far like Houston right and and when you\nWait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at ASU at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you would\nBut at that but as an ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and ... and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed\nMe a muffin that and I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget the\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband ... just because we have to honor\nThat's it and they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping with us\nForty five foot\nAnd behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay and so you got this way everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if you're ... decided to die\nWhen we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there [laughter] so systems\nTo take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends\nThat are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing um the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so\nUh the last we heard or was that we have to take off the side when does it take off and have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] shorts generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet\nSaid you should check your mother board\nIn the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change them I ... back in business and sure enough that's what we did and that was that\nThat was it off it was it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal\nAnd of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\nI [noise] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah it's a basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives\nAnd we're now in possession of a stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F.
