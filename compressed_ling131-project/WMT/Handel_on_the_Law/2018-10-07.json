kind of smoking almost ... miles [laughter] ... smoke [laughter]\nWhat I wanted to get into is a vis a fertile ways but um you know those are ...\nComing up with a kind of stuff and\nYou know if I was a reaction to the\nPGA Hawkins and talking about the big field goal there but at first you got some special guest here with us tonight\nOh heck yeah so set out to my parents would offer Noreen bowlers or my sister ... we're all in the house yeah right they came all the way from Edmonton, Alberta Canada to hang out with this [laughter] at all yeah so it's been really fun having my parents here welcome good of all and uh\nWe enjoyed having you here at Hudson's and hanging out with their little post game party here that we get together and do each and every week and it's a lot more fun with Iowa comes out victorious especially in what may be the coolest trophy game and I would say probably is the coolest trophy game and all of the country because of the history and the governors and it was alive pick for awhile actual pig yeah\nAnd now it's a Ninety One pound brown said well if not us but soon\n[laughter]\nOr in Oakland bucket [laughter] I mean\nIf you got a bucket to a man you know one of my book [laughter] at that or an ad no hold on our money back [laughter] but I don't\nKnow it's not as good as a real pig but it's really cool but like it's a bucket [laughter]\nI mean you know what I guess I Wish I lost the two\n[laughter] we will [laughter] oh\nYeah the ... ... to make sure you clean it [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh here's what I Want to know\nCan you imagine they'll walk on Kirk fair to face with all of our would waltz into his office one day and says hey you know what I think we ought to do we have a set up in the swing AND gate formation\nEvan Oregon a sideways snap it to the tight end and he's going to run around the end didn't get into the corner and again going on a field goal that's what we ought to do what do you think\nOh man you know here's what I Love about that play and I think we should do more but not the fact that we have to resort to those kinds of plays in order to beat teams I'm simply saying they give us said give ... give\nUs as viewers and fans an opportunity to see a little bit of a change up just a little bit it's like when you put the the powder on the doughnuts sprinkle a little bit more on it it just it was known as hot\nPut a little bit of a little bit something on it and I think this is what we saw today and I think people really got excited perfect play called the perfect time\nI'm totally unexpected something that they have not seen on film before and it's just that element of surprise I was very um number one surprise that can lead the fact that it worked and scored was even a better um\nGratification for me so how how long do you suppose it took all of our to sell that play\nMan well okay first of all it breaks all of our rules\nOf conservatism point that's right what do we do hey we're supposed to take place but but but but he\nHas history here right yes history here big game history here\nWhere he can go now come on now I have history with this stuff I Know what I'm Talking about ... and I and I think our\nCoaching staff really appreciates that I Know our leadership really appreciates proven history of researching the right type of sneaking is in little right you know the\nOne in Iowa and I were\nVery straightforward right we like to keep it above board and just tell you we're going to punch in the nose and then punching the nose right other places they like to get a little sneaky and sometimes you know we we break form in swing with the left and cracking [laughter]\n\nBut I think it says a lot about coats parents and the trust that he has what this coaches I mean I think sometimes coaches can be\nSo controlling in the sense that they don't allow their coaches to expand their areas of expertise and I think coach fares has enough confidence in his coaches and empowers this coaches to be able to make calls like that and feel confident whether it works or not the fact that it was able to be\nExecuted the way it was it just puts gravy on the potatoes in my opinion absolutely mhm\nWell consider he snapped it with his left hand you know like he did this once or twice there's time 'cause this is the left and swing from\nGotta make sure that you don't like take a step back and it ends up being a ladder alright right or a a former tax data you want to it's got to be a lateral so he just he just grab that\nLaunched it here in the hands right on cue I mean that was that was just thinking about the time they tried that you could either rolled on the ground [laughter]\nI was in the backfield somewhere random sure we're\nStuck in the two\nMen you venue for a while [laughter] I Want to hear they probably made a target for it I can see the targeting of art that guy just throwing it over their camp\n[laughter]\nBut that is you got to do but I think they were actually going to do it when they lined up there I you know I wasn't sure I thought this I thought what they were going to do is what they did against um Ohio State last actually yeah because that's where I was like a we've seen this\nBefore and when they when I realized what they were doing I was like wait a minute and then he snapped the ball with his left hand and it went in\nMy lifestyle right oh I like that\nGive me ... and and it almost to a certain degree I wanted more\nExactly yeah well you know you know that was the play the grandpa right\nOh but he settled in the game you say oh we going to be playing here is as good as the hawks are going to ... go for that reason just kind of cell did they had their early ... game and ... and everything and it's all settled in and it all they do that and everybody goes crazy [noise] and the kids running around\nYou know I was hearing Hudson's in the place went crazy\n[laughter]\nYeah that's a that's a wake me up call and it was fun and and it's great to see the guys have fun\nAnd and I think that's what it's about ... I think and I think that's the atmosphere and the DNA that coach really wants them to play with it to have some fun and to relax but\nAgain I mean we'll go we will go back into our conservative nature which is how we do things but we just want to let the world know that if you play with us\nWe do got to trick play here and there that we will play once in a while ha it's once in a great while but we will we got it if we need it\nI Would imagine all of ours probably got a couple of more of those when you're ...\nOh [noise]\nI mean you don't you don't want to become like a cliche with it or it just become reliant on them you know boring because you do it all the time you ... it's it's like the unexpected flowers man you know like if you come with flowers every weekend and he's like oh why did you bring me a big ...\nOkay [laughter] right but you know every once in a while it was good I have\nAnd I [laughter]\nYeah he did sixty yards and off to the races for a mere speck more set in general\nSeem like a pretty good day for the receivers for the hawk eye in the victory over the over three six five or six hundred eight hundred three three two fifty for a one star six hundred on your life was sweet Lou and salty Trevor ... given to the phones we go we'll start with Dave who wants to talk that very subject Dave what's going on your on the huddle\nThan having a good time down there and do a lot of laughing and enjoyed a big win but our guys thought I wanted to talk about two or three things if I could uh first I like the way we spread the ball around today I'm\nBoth dismiss I thought at the games and ranch really good routes when you just played a big show of kids by a mirror and Brandon Smith addict\nBut I had that one spectacular catch up with a D back in and out reached him in Quetta fought for that that passed for about Twenty years I think he's starting to Richard Nick easily I Know it was leading receiver and of course or or to a bedrock a fair\nAnd hiking and another big game of the couples already back so I had some sketchy so I I really liked the uh the spreading around the ball\nOr did you get a comment about that I'm a show to other things that you know hang up I thought the special days maybe had their best all around game of the of the year so far as a\nRash dead or had four or five good touch and he had some good rules but I thought he was salad and put Minnesota deep and their territory where they did drive or sometimes but they had to go to the length of the field I thought a mere\nMarcia Smith at two outstanding kickoff returns they're almost broke that second one he was about you know you had to jump over some of your summer I think he would have gone to distance\nAnd I am McGill Regina set a salad game both plays kicking in and kicking off in that so I just really like the way that the special teams played today\nAnd then uh what was the other day I was gonna say um [noise]\nI didn't I didn't think are among the Jones got a fair shake I met that target and call I mean he ...\nWindows that easy to a whole lot but I Know who when Trevor Noah better than I Do I play a little football myself but it is I never I never get hit like those two like money Jones but I hit the guy in the shoulder pads I Know you're a referee Andy I don't know what your thought is but I I don't think he should have been ejected I think you definitely deserve to Fifteen your family\nBut he wasn't going for his head or they are two other quick things I think we got to tell you that up on the defensive line I Love her defense she blinded like literally and Trevor and you were saying I think we\nGet Minnesota some of the credit we seem to ... days ago more them drive has some big drives it seemed like the first to drive the game we hold them three it out and then we get a ... a penalty for\nAn illegal substitution for some reason that she didn't know they kind of caught fire and I know we gave it to gifts but anyway I I Want to see as being more selling\nAll the way around it I Love our guys are just going to have to reach back in the last thing I Wonder if you could go over the stats again for for both teams so a great show guys and the goal auction will have to be ready next Saturday guys\nNo question about that the banks are checking it out touched on that illegal substitution that was a five yard penalty made it from thirty nine to Thirteen for but the next pathway went for Thirteen yard so they got a first down either way that penalty probably didn't matter a whole lot um as far as receivers\nToday geysers initial topic\nBrandon Smith America's Mick mark that Lou kinda maybe came into their own what'd\nSay today yeah I was I was very impressed by the play of all of our receivers in particular I mean obviously you will\nAbout the tight end or you know it kind of put them off into their own little subset but as far as the receiving corps I thought they did an excellent job of of um you know execution or my thought easily you had a really good game he was critical in some career critical situations where we needed\nTo pick up first down these that really nice possession receiver um that that is just so nice luxury to have these are very dependable kind of guy\nUm the other guys are really starting to come in their own I think we saw some things last week against Wisconsin that they really didn't make us real happy about some of the drop passes and things like that but I liked the fact that we're spreading the ball around ... I like the fact that um we're getting our\nWe're taking some challenges a little bit further down the field and not just running those those those short to intermediate routes but we're taking some chances down the field so spreading the wealth is great I think that shows that we have some balance on often\nWait hold on that would mean that somebody that there there might have been a sighting of a vertical passing game\n[laughter] in Iowa [laughter]\nNow you're so we're in the ... tape ... wait wait we're in a big tent is three yards in the cloud of dust man\nAt home and stuff all the rain but it's been had there's no way there was any duct anywhere [laughter] All right fine Syria yards in a global mud yeah [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nRight not only did you see a sign of a vertical ... I got a chart here look at it is\nYeah I Know that that's why she they were in Iowa again [laughter] I think that's a reserve for the big well where's the fences optional\n[laughter] right [laughter]\nOh cycling guys play in that way we really\nHey I Would I Would say it's the same amount of points today well both got big wins [laughter]\nSeriously [noise] interesting [laughter] yeah do they ... me worry about if they pass it vertical I'm just interested in the fact that we threw it down on the field further than ten five yard I don't know I Know yeah we are staples of five and out man not only that but I have six\nDifferent people catch passes today and I'm sitting here looking at it you said about easily I was leading receiver [noise]\nSix catches um longest Twenty one Brandon Smith five catches longest twenty six fans caught four and a touchdown Smith more set had three catches longest sixty Hawkins in three long after thirty\nIvory Kelley Martin even had to walk up twenty five\nWow wait [laughter] well that that's the sound file I stop that's not five an hour cut it out [laughter] people are going to we're going to start wondering who the heck we are for like a home estate or something\nThey got beat today you don't want to do them I Would they be especially since I got to be from Iowa State you don't want to do that was a poor example care to actually attack or did they ... I don't know if they want somebody one would you please\nUh I don't know I don't know one\nThat would be a vertical passive maybe TCU yeah could have been okay go there so somebody somebody like Texas or when they throw the ball down to oil northwestern and yard northwestern wash too so we can't use them and you wouldn't anyway he\nLet's just not deal with those guys in time with those guys right now we fight we [laughter]\n\nOr you know I didn't get it in one once this year I'm just saying right now we're celebrating the fact that we saw something that people have said you know I Would doesn't do well I Can't do and we ... we proved that we can do it\n[noise] yeah so the question I mean there's been more set on the welfare she'd post game locker room\nSeriously I I did do it today so what's clear\nIs marrying so we got one Nikki Haley mentally second year me and ... and all of a sudden you know the chemistry between the whole office Nicole with us so you know two years now so he doesn't chemistry thing I'm now that we have the trust between all of us\nNothing we had last year but you know on a space faring that's the only thing that you're not far\nYou're buying that driver\nMan okay let's see yes here here's my ten dollars going All right when the second best reset reset that 'cause my forty five dollars for my ticket [laughter]\nI'm sure you want to change your money\nThe money is the way it is man I'm putting it in there that experience you have always\nSaid that there is a level of chemistry that comes from being together from working together from expecting how far that guy is going to run in two seconds right there's a level of chemistry that comes from that and\nBeing able to get vertical says I should expect my man to be twenty five yards don't feel when I put this type of air on it or I go to like a laser and he's there and this has turned around and he's looking for the ball [noise]\nYou're not waiting to see his eyes you're throwing it before he looks\nYep and I told Minnesota did that and there were these particularly on those touchdown passes I mean the guy I mean the the quarterback actually through it to a spot and the guy literally met at the spot where the ball with that\nThat it was shoulder he led with the shoulder and the hit was below the shoulder pet was it a very hard hit it was was it a football play it was\nDid he leave the ground and leap towards the player Wally making help with\nThe helmet competent how contact which is the hit that they're trying to get out of the game no way that's how I thought well what'd you say\nYeah I I I I tend to agree with you exactly you know point by point on that and yeah I I I really didn't think that there was um justify that\nUm [noise] you know as far as the targeting call I I I just I just struggling with this so much because I\nThink unless it's a [noise] it's it's such a great line between\nYou know where you know you got understand that the census defenseless player I understand the fact that you got you know you leave with the head part but [noise]\nFootball is a very physical sport it is an end to be honest with you I mean you START I mean you start impacting [noise] you know guys aggression [noise] to the degree of a big hit [noise]\nNow I don't get me wrong I been knocked out\nTo the point where I came back to the heart of like a can you give me a super size fries [laughter] Happy Meal well we can see what back hard\nThat's right [laughter] wait a minute you see what that cause the perpetual diet [laughter]\nDiet that continue years and years [laughter] but [noise]\nI don't agree with Andy On this I don't know to avoid your position is on it\nAll right so here's you know you guys might get you guys might get surprised by this I think it was a good call okay\nAll right now me myself and me I Am all about the banking I Love the smashing I Love the physicality of football I think it was a cheap shot\nI don't like cheap shots I like it when you know the guy is looking at he's going to either you or you got to light 'em up when he's coming I don't like it when the guy's not looking at you think you're going to get away with a shot on him\nOkay and and I hear what you're saying\nBut what was the tradition and football in terms of receivers over the middle when you guys play\nIt wasn't when they were catching the ball it was keep your head on his swivel because he is going to hit you with his arms and shove you lift you up right and you are going to go flying if it wasn't nobody ever led with a shoulder\nOr you know yes there may have been but it wasn't like me coming towards you it was more if it was a different angle is what I'm saying it wasn't a straight on angle it was him coming forward normally
