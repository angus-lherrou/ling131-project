a hundred thousand plus stadium six twenty sixteen out there and it just didn't go well at all\nFor the hockey or today I thought so too um but I mean they executed the players don't field and they the gas just on a few big ones so we got the shore of that stuff on next week and that's one thing That's Matt Nelson there on the welfare seating hunting\nPost game microphone that I ... as best I was able to determine Lou either I was tipping their place somehow which I don't think going on for Franklin and those guys are just really really gifted with a sense of\nGuessing what I was going to be in because I was quite a cover zero there in the first quarter and maybe some of the ethnic sorely too and seeing this and being able to change the play but you talk of a perfect play called that happened three or four different times for big plays for the alliance\nYeah they did man they they put together a good script even after some of the the pitfalls that they had early on in the game you know ... you know watch the game at the beginning of the of the [noise] when it started and you know\nThe ... are dropping points and safety and things like that that was going on but\nMan and then the quarterback gets hurt comes back and then he runs at what fifty are such a hard time down there I mean who does that mhm I mean I'm like this this so you're watching the game kind of unfold and then we get all the way to the end you're like\nOkay I was going to win this thing we're marching around with the eight three on three or four line yard line every single\nThen generally wages arms to kill the play clearly there was confusion\nThere yeah yeah so so we had opportunities throughout the game to really win this thing and kind of put it away but we make too many mistakes man and [noise] and um I I\nI we got a lot of things to fix before next week which\nIs a complete a hundred and eighty degrees opposite of what we were talking about a week ago yeah driver but that's my question I mean he doesn't last year when they when the play on the last play the game especially that last drive but your course Barclay had and it said three hundred and some all purpose yard but it seems like\nA unique ability for the Penn State coaching staff and is it film is it a natural gift to call the right place at the right time to write defense if the right time to confuse the opponent [noise]\nWell you know there's a lot of factors that go into that there's luck that comes into that as well but there's also the level of preparation and I'm not\nTo me it did not it doesn't say that I wasn't prepared [noise] there was a level of preparation that we had to and it it show when we really needed it we got all the way down there to me it came down execution mhm you know\nWe had them

I think it checked out of a running play\nI don't know I think you had a face to face and now this is just complete speculation on my part\nOf that but yeah there's there's no food no way for us to know\nThe way the defense was lined up to me it looked like they had outside leverage right so there you go way the fate going to work no because they're they're covering outside lovers for you throw it over the top there's going to be a guy over the top ... on the inside Caesar's slant with them out having outside leverage you're\nIn [noise] except well except\nWhen the guy throwing that you don't realize the phone [laughter] and then the guy that's covering it was trying to cover the slant and ends up being in the spot that you throw it out and [laughter] and then everybody just kind of knives their head is something that was miscommunication and then we move on\nSee I thought the reason why I thought he checked out of that is because I thought there was a you know they they screwed some people down in the bucks there okay and okay and that when he saw that\nYou say okay we can't run the football you're 'cause they they they got something going on at random Blitzer ... one guy's uncovered or something like that so I'm a hot\nHot I hear you know we did not have enough ... you kind of look at personnel and say okay do we have enough to block this play effectively right you know what I mean and that's one of the things that quarterbacks are are supposed to do they're supposed to look at it and say hey do we have enough to run the play effectively mhm right well did they stack that site\nAnd it could very well been that he saw that they stack that side it was not going to be effective we didn't have enough bodies to match their body\nAnd rather than take a timeout he killed the first place I go into the ... by running hot and that didn't work out either\nWell no because you know people just [noise]\nBecause ... because people didn't communicate see there you go down [laughter]\nSay talk to me [laughter] and it's kinda hard [laughter]\nWhen you want when you want to blue flowers I just tell you [laughter] told me I guess the one I saw was telling me [laughter] you know I Want [laughter]\n\nOh God [laughter] oh boy [laughter]\nThat's where we descended to here after Iowa who loses by sex in happy valley\nOr more coming up here on the altar for cat Hawkeye huddle including Randy schooling opposed to frame scoreboard update as a few surprises took place Iowa\nOr maybe being one maybe not being one of the ... the way the biggest had predicted but certainly a north western Michigan state maybe Iowa State to from Hudson says I tell you what do you got there I ... got some we got some Mac and cheese there\nI guess a Mac and cheese uncharacteristic for me but they said they were spicy [laughter] so that is characteristic for me yeah you like spicy stuff too yeah baby right and then a ... and then and then trying to introduce you catch some ... comments yes with the [noise]\nFor me it was with the bread and there's an actual chips and some bread all just you know just got two types of homeless here for you to just like nibble on you know\nExpanding our horizons he is he doing fantastic man I'm a big homeless man man I could tell you know and and I'm I'm I'm giving you know [laughter]\nI've been I've been in a\nFasting this whole week [laughter]\nI'm just hoping yeah it is helping me help me out to the homeless got ya oh gosh [laughter] on the altar forget Hawkeye had more in just a moment\nOn the job site or farm outdoor cat is your local kennel Baylor dealer this football season shapes wood zero percent for sixteen months financing a new cat scans tears and many excavators plus a two year two thousand our bumper\nBumper equipment protection plan included for those that work hard and play hard el ... started to introduce the new cat you Joni vehicle built for performance comfort and versatility visit outdoor for not job today to experience the outdoor for advantage for yourself\n\nI Do\n... congratulations congratulations on your entire life is filled with adventure be sure you celebrate them all with help from her role rental in Iowa City and online at Errol rental dot com\nIt's the\nDouble you on the twenty sixth annual majestic Alaska cruise\nWell traveled to six through the twenty first and we'd love to have you along with starting with the seven days on line as we kick off our tour with a dinner theater district the party than we don't inland exploring finale mount McKinley and the night\nWhere we'll see wildlife amazing scenery and new experience since then we've all the beautiful princes ship for a seven day cruise with stops in funding unique ports in cruising right up to the glaciers then we end or to work in Vancouver", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Handel on the Law", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "28"}
