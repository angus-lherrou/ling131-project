I got a Nineteen sixty vet does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do for ... dual for barrels on it it's a beast or not but but it is a project car I mean

that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kind of stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\n[noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[laughter] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by\nUm my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt as in about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it you pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money I had the time um\nWe'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been most of the expenses run a month\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars covering the hotel\nOr a guy who'd and then you're going to get the money back when you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying the pain that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use is\nThe ... and then you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back a little company you're taking a big risk sure yours or you're the bank or\nFor the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nThey may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so ... so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company goes broke they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing is Thirty years or seen happen a lot of care\nSo then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known is up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollar right I don't ask my ...\nPeople to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets so we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food\nWhen they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me to pay back\nWe just pay for it we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card away with a credit card\nGonna make you how ... going to make your stomach but those now you're realizing their religion this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show

do\nIn a closed door Q A session Ilan most said that fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announced that they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source at all they do a better job at that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\nBut I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of a way that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi\nThe see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a

then later on stilts come this hour the new new is tracks to get the lowest air fare online and back to the phones we go with the von in California and Nevada California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app so and I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched till I'm ...\n[laughter] that's good his fat\nDifferent is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basic okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay so if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com pass whatever may be is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year\nSo and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're getting um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun Oh yes I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love this to mind when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pickled daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right question songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has to be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers and the bad guys don't get you so ah so you're right there are all these different VPN lose some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nBe heard we talk about that I'm no\nOkay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else you get the house okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nOr a border patrol now if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line and sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes\nJust wanted to really quickly as you mentioned
