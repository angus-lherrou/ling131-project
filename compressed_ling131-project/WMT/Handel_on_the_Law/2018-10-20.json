I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on my right\nAnd I thought it on a great guy we have about ten thousand dollars and I got to that and you're saving lay out in ... ah we combined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took up we had a lot but we took a bite out of that so\nMany help you know within hours like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you now you're going to do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free [noise]\nYeah the only reason I I Would hesitate because not because you're doing airplane and you know it's just that the end of the year that will be very tough and I feel no a

on Christmas at everything by then I Would try to track\nMhm okay ... okay [noise] um the uh the uh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could slip home you're pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two I mean I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want you to keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that Scott Moran margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me the three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one\nAnd so a migraine one and dumped the other one the fifty thousand doesn't move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know hardly making anything on that\nAnd that you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya\nMeaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks by the ... year lose money on that house if you go to three months vacancy if the market softened up so\nYou just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically equity\nSo I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise between the two of you and um and if you're going to hold the other one than you guys just got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on through and getting the emergency fund done and get a proper emergency fund in place and\nAnd if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to and they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth\nWhen you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike how are ya\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my ... that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund so I'm I'm a baby step on um the first time I've got a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just kept dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay M. and they're all going in ...\nWell just seems like I I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah well that you're you're just takes a little while to get things adjusted the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong put more in there but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are\nI mean I bet people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask why should I invest in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you want a job on one around just give it to you and that way you have to worry about it oh okay All right I'm that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership to that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online\nExperience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow payout forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar that my at every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or misspent Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any leftover money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before in the past and this one is definitely the easiest as far as\nThe Harlem and the problem is is you are facing your realities it's not the app and it's not the system but it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it will be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not\nForgetting all soccer pictures and then I got this one down you know and we know what the food really caution we know what the utilities really are and got a few things that are fixed that are predict the bombing Iran or your mortgage payment that's fixed thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the coercion\nForce corrections done and get adjusted sounding you'll get it man I Know and I'll have Kelly ... will get you signed up for financial\nThanks to Dr ... or ... or get within our social producer named Dave Ramsey your host and we'll be back [noise]\n\nSaid boy production off the show

of the road but they say that the data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot\nThey're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice scape says they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it caused between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts\nOr when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right\nAnd twenty sixteen drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what does that collision has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of a moonie em twenty plane and then a drone\nIt was a DJ I found him to quad copped or it's two point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could actually handle so the phantom wasn't certain to forty foot cannon released at a speed of two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object and that's the key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoons for chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video you can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage its\nMain weight bearing spar in other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to
