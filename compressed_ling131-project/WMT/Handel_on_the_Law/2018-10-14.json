phones a five point five minutes display it's going to set you back eight hundred bucks\nThen there's the pixel three ... a six point three inch display starts at nine hundred bucks this is interesting\nAnd I got some camera upgrades of course they all do but they have a new color called not pink [laughter] what should we call this color that's kind of like not paying that work\nThere is also an official charging stand there is now the slate twelve point three inch tablets eight hundred bucks if you like androids stuff has some to check out\nA there's also the home hub this is their smart speaker bolted down hundred and fifty bucks and it's got a ship on October twenty second comes in green bank not paying a dark gray and white and also has built in you too isn't that fabulous maybe not\nBut this home hub is actually funding has really fast maybe\nIt's not as robust as Amazon's Alexa but it's a really strong competitor and the reason why I bring this up is that if you have somebody on your shopping list for Christmas and they like Android and Google or something you might wanna check out\nIt's as I mentioned a hundred and fifty dollars but some of the cool things that can do can turn it into a digital picture frame you're not using it there was no camera onboard either so if you're a privacy conscious and keep that in mind\nBut when it is a digital picture frame it taps into all your photos that you have up in the cloud and Google Photos again good Christmas present for those Android folks on your list\nAnd one of the cool things about the new Google products is maybe just maybe a stop to all the robo callers and the scammers\nBecause here's the deal the new go Google Pixel phones are going to screen your calls to stop the robo callers and scammers\nAnd Apple's linked to the game but they this past week said oh we're going to kind of have that they filed a patent called detection of spoof call information\nIt is going to enable an iPhone to check

your beats per minute well how exactly\nDoes that work what is going on why would a fitness tracker detect a beating heart on a roll of toilet paper that's what you heard me right a roll of toilet paper if you put your smart watch on a roll of toilet paper it will say that it's beating eighty one beats per minute\nI tried it out myself Chinese tech site advocates report this past week the toilet paper is having a viral moment because fitness tracker owners have discovered they just play a heart rate when attached to her role\nThey also tested others cylinder object a bottle a can a banana even an appendage of a stuffed animal all of which showed this mysterious phantom ...\nAs I mentioned the toilet paper a BP above eighty one a coffee mug at a beep PM of Seventy two banana Seventy two beats per minute [noise]\nAnd it's not just other fitness trackers also the apple watch the Android where similar results here's the deal to detect a heartbeat trackers former green light on your wrist\nBlood absorbs the green light so when the blood flows faster it absorbs more green light to there are some signs for you this process known as ... just a simple way to detect how fast someone's heart is beating since bananas and mugs have services that are more reflective than toilet paper\nMakes sense that it's going to have a heart rate that's more consistent than say the roller toilet paper but you might be thinking to yourself we need to go to the bottom of this [laughter] if I were too busy we're on a roll as you get that [laughter] [noise] okay\n[noise] All right let's

E. three four are you at the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across race\n... and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. cause you to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you were just look at that as a password you'd be like that's a darn good password exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nUh some some a haiku you know a gang symbol on most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords oh I'm so don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nI mean what was your a second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's the way to to step verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for parents football every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an Yahoo apple on my phone they

with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise] ah\nSo you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday surf act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in checks it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what I thought it was like there are publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nAh there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nI see if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that you have these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word ... called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular ...\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work I work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task putting in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and\nOr drop me a note through the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nOr for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and if you're a Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join ... club right now\nOver at get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what the Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show\nMe what you see\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusions to our privacy can have devastating consequences\nOne great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network when choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend eh speak to our freedom VPN\nF secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes F secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required you can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online\nOr to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount code Kim visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp [noise]\n\n\nHey this is worse than she does and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and\nResources there then be prepared dot com slash Kim and be ready for anything once again that the prepared dot com slash cab [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cans that are just wide open to attack\nAnd I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called chai among guy that's the ... that\nThe company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to me the name on the Web cam or the security can [noise] because they make tons of Web cams for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening\nIs that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change in the\nFall password somebody can still break in and if in case you want to see if your Web cams security cameras on the list head over to commanded outcome of course that's K.

we see all those three D. photos hacked on Facebook\nOur money to those moments away it's ten free things that every Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this and back to the phones we go with a let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nEither him hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question here\nMy question it's a ... to ... all along reputation management mhm I guess my first let them be like well with me the best all around that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it that was all oriental a software that you ... and then the field that search engine optimization ethical would all fall ill\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nAll the problem in what some of it is obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bad reviews they look balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and football's there the positive experience is that what you do at your business [noise]\nSo what am I here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses so what I Need to do is find something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management firm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job that's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp\nOr were where is it going to last for all the medical school it's like health grade the current okay all lady the et cetera\nSo OK you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you\nKnow if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you up on line and\nJust drop some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the other thing you can\nGet let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard that when you do this then health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars what would you at the top of the Google Search results", "year":
