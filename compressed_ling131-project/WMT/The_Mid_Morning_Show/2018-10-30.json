together\nAnd and by the fairgrounds course Christine is talking about Wyoming or Wyoming fares one of those small towns where anti Peterson's from where Christine is from where I get to go every once in a while\nAnd you folks don't you don't just have a town celebration you actually have a fair grounds there at the edge of town and there is an existing playground there but this is something that you want to I mean why the need for something new is just the old one is time to be replaced or you want to go bigger and better or what's the thought here casino\nWell it's been there for over fifty years and it's it's definitely served its purpose and I thought it would just make it look a lot nicer actually put a new one\nNow tell me a little bit about this because this is a new playground um that that's going to be a for everybody it's one of those all inclusive playgrounds where everybody can come swing and play and and have a good time isn't it\nYeah how do you go Ohio Go ahead\nI have like playing than fly to hold onto and all that stuff on it\nNow how do you go about coming up with an idea 'cause I remember as a little kid I mean everybody would draw a picture of like all this playground would be cool if we had this and this and if you were actually taking an idea and you're putting it into motion how do you even go about designing a playground\nYou've got an actual like rendering of what this thing is going to look like you've got the price tag take me for a little bit of that process\n[noise] um well so one of the Clinton\nThat are going to keep as something that the ... about ten years ago and the company that was on it was like hospice done okay and so I went to their website and they found a bunch of information on it they had like different take on design\nAnd I created like ... like what one I thought well it look nice and\nI ended up sending that to a woman named Catherine Salmon and so she called me it's like okay I got there\nWhat would you like to me so they can go over which won anything could work so he did that and then we ended up like taking the one that like the best that then changing a couple of things that it was kind of like what I thought would be the best and then that's kind of as far as has gotten\nYou know you really of Christ you know you're getting the live out a dream of so many kids want it to like design a playground I mean how cool have you stop and realize that how many kids grow up wanting to do this and you're actually doing it here right now in twenty eight ten you were designing something and now bringing it to life\nYeah when I was talking to her we've had conversations that it's like pulling out here and our child\nAnd [laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nWell you were one of the most mature young ladies that I Know I I Want I Want you to know that and by the way for those who aren't familiar Christina by the way it makes the best cookie bars we've got 'em in the shop when we work on the farm up there so not only are you an awesome playground designer but you were a great little a Baker to keep us well fed but\nNow here's the thing you've got the design you want to bring this to the fairgrounds but what does something like this cost Christine how how many ... give me like a ballpark idea what's this thing going to cost to get it up on the fairgrounds in Wyoming\nAround forty five thousand dollars\nAnd I'm assuming you don't have just forty five thousand dollars laying around in a piggy bank somewhere up there do you know\nNo so tell me about how you're raising the money for this because this is a really cool project I've been able to see it and we're going to put pictures up and up on our website and uh tell everybody about where how can they help you out with this\nWell

Chevy ... of them they can't\nTell everybody a little bit about that and I want to circle that date on your calendar November tent there is a Saturday and it is the same day as the northwestern game
