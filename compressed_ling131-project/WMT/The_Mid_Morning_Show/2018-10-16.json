Justice Roberts this morning ... forbid morning show Rhone right up until eleven o'clock here and in this segment of the program we aren't going to talk with John jak or he works with a Fox News radio and uh we're gonna talk a little bit about uh the aftermath of hurricane\nMichael it's something that just a just devastated the Florida Panhandle I see the pictures a John and I I just can't believe the amount of devastation you know the before and after picture is really tell it all ... some of these communities are just down to ground level almost right oh\nYou're absolutely right you know the video I think that does that justice in the sense that you can see how devastating the impacts hurricane Michael was\nWhen it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle and that's what president saw yesterday uh that's what he toured on marine one and you know these beach areas and on the Florida Panhandle that were the site of when Michael made landfall are just yes and made it it's probably going to take about two months\nFor some of these communities to get up and running as far as a working and drink a bottle of water a in addition to electricity and then it's probably gonna take years to get back to the place they were before the hurricane hit\nOr their residents still in the area trying to I ... somebody homes were just totally obliterated by this storm I don't know where they would find shelter in these communities are it in the warm weather\nI saw the forecast they just took a look at the forecasts it's mid eighties so if you don't have air conditioning or any kind of cool I like that I I just wonder how is the population dealing with it or are they still been evacuated and not have come back\nWell for some individuals that have\nHad their homes completely leveled yeah there's no looking to go back to\n'em but for other individuals who just you know seeing their homes\nSeverely damaged a lot of structural damage that's why famous down there so FEMA can offer some short term fixes for them and in some cases some longer term fixes for those individuals are that have you know sort of fall into that category\nFamous going to be down there for the next few weeks and maybe a longer than that because\nWe're talking about a storm which caused\nBillions billions with the billions of dollars worth of damage\nHow does it really stack up with other storms I I think Katrina Andrew those names really kind of revoke the a kind of devastation that they're going through in the Florida Panhandle I how does this rank up\nWell according to the governor of\nFlorida and that's where Andrew it um you know made landfall at Ohio State area of Florida I was down there or\nThat particular hurricane working uh in Miami and the governor says it's right up there and you know keep in mind you know the the the cost estimates associated with hurricane Michael are going to be right up there with the cost estimate of\nA Hurricane Andrew which are it back in Nineteen Ninety two so that's going back to our ways but you know what we've seen is you know I visited areas including his cane and\nA South Florida that were hit hard by Hurricane Andrew is areas can come back and that's what a certainly is the hope for the areas that were hard hit along the panhandle of Florida\nAre ... and I thought they were incredibly well prepared considering there was a shorter ... there were shorter timeframe here it was kind of more challenging to be better prepared\nOr because it just went from a tropical storm to category for within the course of a couple of days most of the ones where you can see developing out in the Atlantic ocean in it takes a while to\nReally make land but this one was just over the course of the Gulf of Mexico and then boom ... celebrated in really packs a punch\nIt it you know it was a few uh degrees\nLessons strength then uh it would have been a a category five hurricane making landfall a which would have been I think on record the most powerful hurricane to hit the uh can take you with us so it was a powerful storm you know the video\nAriel you've seen the aerial chicken or the scene of that particular part of the pan handle a tell the picture of the kind of devastation that the people businesses even farmers you know farmers when we're talking about Georgia the president also visited Georgia yesterday and farmers\nAre certainly suffered quite a bit and it will take a lot for them to get back on their feet because we're talking about crops that were damaged and I think that'll for a lot of us or you can understand how um\nHow much a cost it will be for those farmers to to get back up on their feet\nWhen one question before you um we we say goodbye to John what um I guess FEMA it's got a how\nMuch can FEMA take on because they were just only a couple of weeks after Florence and that was a pretty devastating a issue with the amount of rain that the gun in the south Carolina North Carolina coast can FEMA handled two of these you know just a couple of weeks apart\nThe answer's yes they can and they are and there are lots of resources the president has devoted to FEMA and also keep in mind we're not done with hurricane season which is a scary thought so that you know FEMA needs to\nGet the people of the panhandle in particular back on their feet and then they have to prepare for the possibility of another natural disaster\nA happening over the course of the next few weeks ... few months before hurricane season by lake ...\nKind of moving forward but always looking over your shoulder right that's right exactly right Oh thank you John we appreciate your perspective on this hurricane just to demonstrate in the Florida Panhandle thank you so much for your time this morning\nThank you for having me on we'll talk real sense\nOkay some some good does John Tucker Fox News radio correspondent a discount and giving us the inside the president or making the tour through the uh\nAffected areas yesterday but a boy that that one pack to walk in and then it was a pretty good size punch\nFifty now we've had fifty in Cedar Rapids as we continue a warm up toward sixty hopefully today that's kind of what our goal is at least to right now fifty a ten Seventeen\nBe finished by Thursday of this week if we found for example the southeast quadrant was running heavy for us we might have to work\nIn that quadrant on a Wednesday a little bit and then we'll move ahead to the the next squadron and friday would be to catch up day in that scenario so far and for this week where on schedule we should finish the both quadrant ... by Thursday Afternoon\nAnd then next week we suspect that we're going to start running into the heavier volume where we might need to continue working in the one quarter and a little longer than the schedule shows but that friday is the catch up day\nIf for some reason the volume is just absolutely tremendous and we're not able to get through the two quadrant by the end of the week that may put us into an overtime situation on Saturday but that also gives us that Saturday to catch up if we need to\nOkay and then with the leaf piles that are out there you I Would imagine you would rather if you could take some of the bigger branches out of there and just make it purely leaves that helps the effort to\nAbsolutely if you think if you're vacuum holes on your own home vacuum and sometimes maybe a pen or a\nPencil or some other larger long object get sucked up into it and it just hangs up in the hose branches in larger limbs twigs they'll do the same thing with or at least truck\nSo absolutely if the pilots can be pretty much just pure leaves\nSome grass and there is fine we know some homeowners may mow the lawn and kind of dumping mixture of grass and weeds at the edge of the road that's absolutely fine but please yes remove any twigs large branches et cetera from there that would go a long way\nAnd the residents of Cedar Rapids if they would like more details you have a really great a schedule on line so tell them where they can find the leaf pick up schedule\nIt would be on the solid\nWaste pages of the city is Cedar Rapids website and I just I guess go to the city's website and from there you can navigate your way to write all the waste pages and I\nI Would imagine a Google Search for leaf pickup city of ... would be pretty good for twenty
