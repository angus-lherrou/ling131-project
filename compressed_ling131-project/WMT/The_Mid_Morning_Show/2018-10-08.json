M. t.s Cedar Rapids and I heart radio station [noise]\nStorms heading toward a Florida I'm Chris foster Fox News it's tropical storm Michael right now about a hundred and twenty miles off the coast of Mexico moving toward the Gulf\nAs work our way into Thursday looking at a high right around forty nine degrees odd latest from the national weather service the cedar at Cedar Rapids right now is at eleven point one seat that's up a foot off the current forecast graph\nAnd the current forecast graft takes it to a little over sixteen feet by the time we get to the weekend or I Will give you some caution that that may be increased um we need to watch that because there's a lot of water falling upstream this does take into account in inch and a half to two and a half inches of rain upstream\nWe've already had some spots exceed one inch so that's the caution\nIs that there's a lot of runoff happening and that value may increase so stay tuned\nI'm ... and let you know the official updates are typically issued every four hours or so I'm Sorry every six hours or so four times a day and we typically see this so we should get an update most certainly before the the TV and I knew that ... days that bright spot plenty of sunshine but windy Klein only around forty nine\nAnd then as you get into friday and Saturday there's another system coming in um hopefully that one can miss to ourselves quite frankly but\nUh I'd rather at a state of the south we have a chance for at least some rain showers in the area both those states outside right now looking at the old Doppler radar we've got that line of showers and thunderstorms off towards our west right now I'd say\nBooks like about ... county through about northwest bent and up through the cannon is going to be the cut off for right now um but again there is an easterly component to some of that northern Missouri rain so I think over time it's probably going to make its way east we're just as a day goes on\nAh I Know we're still are in a waiting pattern for metro marching band classic I've not heard one word um well they will make the call today that's what I've heard so they will decide here in the next hour\nOr whether they'll do it today or move it to next Monday and I share your thoughts with them I've shared my thoughts with them and I'm pretty sure we know what's going to happen\nWell we'll wait it's all out or you know whatever they want to do what they want to handle it and everything um but yeah you know the the amount of precipitation coming in this isn't a this is uh Justin ... that I'm I'm our\nAre wrong yeah but some models are useful through and I think that's a really accurate statement because when you look at these rainfall chances the occurrence of rain has happened every day\nThe amounts have been all over the place though and it does not take much right now to really cause a big concern so that's where we wind up situated right now is what's going to wind up happening with all the runoff and how much rainfall do we get and I will tell you that the models have shown\nMultiple occasions now I'm of a southeast shift with some of the heavier rains from this past weekend we saw that in writing the last night we saw that as well and so I see all this rain and central Kansas moving\nIts way up towards the north northeast I have to wonder if instead of having its sights set on northwest Iowa that might cut right in the north central Iowa that'd be the headwaters of the theater and the Iowa you're though that's where I think we weigh a long lasting impacts off this even after the rain has done\nYou know we may have we may have a flood situation well into next week or based on how this thing looks out the corps of engineers um yeah I have a time they updated was nine thirty four yesterday so I think it's a matter of moments before they wind up getting an update out everybody what I can tell you is obviously they're they're it's a challenging\nPuzzle right now because you you can only let out so much um you've got the cedar river that'll be cresting you've got the English that's in major flood category record high in October you've got the\nMississippi that's flooding and so the core is going to basically just hold their own here where they're at\n'em and just kind of hope that the un flows can cannot cause at Dover top but ah right now they've got a seven or eight point five happening on October Eighteenth\nAnd again the situation at the core of the lake is also one that may flux a little bit depending on how much rain falls um to give you an indication spillway crust is seven twelve so that three and a half below the top also do six eighty three is your normal level\nSo it's twenty five feet above normal which is just and that's an actual actually twenty five feet two stories above normal that you out like some kind of weird you know\nThere is a bottom yeah ... bottom in the right and it's actually you know that high above its its average white I think a lot of water out there I've seen pictures on Facebook from I think a couple of days ago somebody was\nThere and they posted a picture that the water you know what wasn't too far away but you must remember that ... that that was the top four feet of that spillway has has the most volume because it's\nSo wide cried and I think I think the top four feet of still another twenty five percent a flood storage okay so it gets up to that value but you remember how much is really expanding on there um but you know you're going to notice the vast majority of people are going to notice this along three eighty that it's extremely high yeah extremely high\nUm but you have to remember too that the corps of engineers they're they're trying to balance something very delicate late\nRight now I'm between the cedar river crest 'cause you can't flood Columbus junction out I mean if the court wants to they could\nThey can let it go full bore but you're going to have massive impact downstream if you do that so there's a lot of regulation with what goes on the Mississippi I mean they all work together here and so um we'll see what winds up happening analog may very well be depending on what happens to the theater in Cedar Rapids where the whole basin\nAs lessening you want to do is add that crust bubble come through Columbus junction high and then also the cork on high and then Columbus junction is extremely flooding and so that's where this this whole thing is a really really a give and take delicate balancing act which I Hope that by Wednesday afternoon\nWhen we are able to sample the amount of water that's truly in these basins a loving opportunity to figure out exactly where these rivers are going to go maybe to the nearest foot\nAt that point um but right now sixteen points for us the forecast stay tuned that could come up\nUm that could come up I Know there are actually working on her a vice forecast right now so up and if it does come up I go in a broadcast it out let everybody know what it is or if it does in fact come up from there\nBe high will text me the moment that happened\nWhen I got an I'll be at this meeting so it's a great reason to get out of it really is Justin's on the air I gotta go ... miles out better a better go home number out here to help Robert ... little now we'll see and uh the the corps of engineers would probably have a new forecast in the hour as we are\nMost likely so I can shoot your tax pleased to see this why are the best in the ballot you um two things I spent time in Iowa City Sunday I played the organ at church down there yeah um you are in Iowa City native you were born and raised have you seen water in the places that they've seen water in Iowa City the last thirty six hours\nYou know I haven't been down to Iowa City to check it out honestly but I I saw the river gauge and uh uh I did see some pictures from some viewers down there um you know it's really tremendous is I was city is typically\nProtected flash flooding not always but typically protected because you've got the core of a lake there Jeff they happen to get so much rain south of the dam that they wound up getting that river up to twenty three point two feet which new October record\nAnd uh the one of the striking pictures that I saw was a around Scott boulevard as a dog park mhm nothing but water halfway ... what'd you figure three feet deep yeah like that's just ridiculous from one night\nStand road Napoleon rode a underwater\nYeah it was earlier than road I Believe is still under at highway twenty two I Believe that um because the flood warning was re issued for that spot um 'cause there are two types of flood warnings you might see come out aerial flood warning which is an area\nAnd river flood warning which is the actual basin on the national weather service can issue area warnings meaning things like roads are under just from simple standing water or from creeks and streams that aren't officially forecast for like you know if there's like a local creek in that area that you know of but it really doesn't have a name and it doesn't have a formal gauge\nIf it floods and goes over a road they can actually issue a statement on that um even without a formal gauge being there so that's kinda how I I figured that out this morning and so we have some creeks and streams down there um that are still an issue and so lots watch Forman la ... and I I Would really advise everybody\nYou know when you hear these river numbers you need to check back and check back frequently because it may shift based on how much rainfall comes through Kansas City south west the Kansas City how much rain they got last night\nWas seven inches ... seven or even the environment like that yeah what do you think's going to happen I mean you're going to have a major event\nI got an email from Dave Wilson he's merge the management of management director Johnson\nCounty is up to have a list of ...
