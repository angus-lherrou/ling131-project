you know in southern Iowa you are behind a there is still some drunk condition in that area that said\nWith the harvest going on I Would assume that even in those areas is kind of like you know what

would have not have done that [noise]\nYou know I anyway ... weather now before [laughter] throwing things okay fine lay the forecast signed me please\nAlready well we still have some patches of a fog out there it'll be a not too big of a deal for most of us so I'm\nMainly affecting southern Iowa the next little while otherwise we'll see some showers and a few little bits of drizzle here the next little while uh really going to be focused on this afternoon as a complex of storms out toward the Omaha area rolls off toward the east\nYou may be thinking okay it's cloudy is really it's gonna be cool today for most of us the severe weather potential keep in mind that he didn't last week we had a severe weather at the beginning of the week was that ... a week ago today or to a Wednesday Wednesday I Can't read I'm losing track of everything it was Wednesday yeah\nSure we'll go with that okay uh so and I wonder if the ... early warm or anything like that yeah uh so what we're watching a scenario pressured\nTo rip to the north east um it's going to be passing pretty close to like Cedar Rapids Iowa City up towards Dubuque now south of this thing will\nBe what we call the warm sector so in that area temperatures probably make it into the seventies north of it fifties and sixties would it be a sharp contrast between the fifties in the seventies and uh right around the uh let's say Cedar Rapids Manchester Dubuque coke or\nLike a chipped in an area that's where the biggest question is on how warm are going to get there might be a tend to agree spread in like Fifteen miles an hour or so just keep that in mind at the end up at like\nYou know sixty two today\nYou might be able to drive south a short distance and it's like\nSeventy two or in any case a dungeon storms to become stronger in that warm sector and it looks like that's going to be generally let's say south of highway twenty and east of the three eighty two Eighteen court or\nRoughly speaking a so wind a strong winds potential could be some hail maybe a brief tornado like what we saw last week from the strongest storms not a guarantee but something to be mindful of this afternoon before those ... toward the east or pass the Mississippi River\nBig range of temperatures for areas near north of highway twenty\nLooks like we'll probably stay in the fifties today or should be in the upper sixties around the highway thirty quarter than I was sitting off to the south mid set loaded mid seventies a chance of showers and storms linger into tonight some fog develops late\nWere in the lower fifties patches reserve showers tomorrow may have some of that fog early on loaded mid sixties for Wednesday it'll be breezy and mild hides in the upper seventies looks like we'll be partly to mostly cloudy best chance of a shower or storm is late Wednesday as a cold front approaches\nThursday chance of showers and storms mainly in the afternoon and evening and we keep it rained chance around Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday of next week it is not necessarily going to rain for everybody every single one of those games but the potential is there at least in parts of eastern Iowa every single day and there are\nUm\nHigher than I'd like odds of several inches of rain over the next week particularly in the northern half of Iowa the way things are looking as a result\nI Would say there are much better than even odds that rivers are going to be going a above flood stage again at some point ah we'll just have to see where the heaviest rain falls and go from there but I Do expect there to be some level of river flooding once again this\nMonth see I don't it's this kind of negativity Justin that I just will not stand for ah luckily I'm sitting down making ... by the way we have a correction [noise]\nWith artificial [laughter]\nSo often either theme our sphere whether it was Tuesday\nOh Tuesday than cousin just checked me it was to say [laughter]\nYou think is a meteorologist I wouldn't be able to remember but everything just it's kind of like mix them together is because this active pattern it's been a weird pattern has been in looking at the end the crystal ball territory um what's what's going on is we have\nThe jet stream dipping to our west and it's a rising off to our east and we're in between ... what's basically southwest flow of south west winds about halfway up the atmosphere [noise] um that's not a\nTypical pattern will be very persistent in the fall and it keeps us\nWeather systems so if you're wondering why are we having so many rain chances were kind of in this in between the origin the trough and that's where things are flowing and that's passing right over the mid west every single time\nI Know some of the my phone just rang twice in time they've

M. D. Cedar Rapids\nIs a great deal for all three countries so I'm Dave Anthony Fox News President Trump tweeted out about the agreement with Canada worked out just before midnight joining Mexico and it's just about to talk about it at a White House ceremony commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says\nI Know I I Can't help it was going to be such a good interview to I mean we were\nYou know I'm ... I got to be the difficult one and that that's all right that's all right well I bring you guys in a little light hearted moment but there's some heavy stuff we have to talk about here this morning and I welcome un because\nLast week in the news it was announced that the Cedar Rapids police department is now carrying narcan and for some folks that might have gone over their heads okay why does them that's not important but we circle back to that because\nThis is an important issue not only for Cedar Rapids but for the state of Iowa and Lindsey you're kind of the go to person on this you've done the research you've been designated the expert on this for folks who haven't been paying attention or just kind of\nCaught 'em and went over their head what is narcan and why is this a big deal\nSo it's a big deal because right now the United states than an opioid epidemic um it's been clear nationally and here in Iowa we've seen the effects so having arcane available to our officers has just given us another tool to use\nWhen we come across someone who has or possibly has had an opioid overdose um it's a medication that will help reverse this the symptoms of\nAn overdose and help us get them to the hospital for further medical treatment\nSo essentially let me give me a scenario here where having narcan would make a difference compared to you know two weeks ago where you didn't have it\nYeah sure so as most people know officers usually it's medical things all the fast food and fire trucks and ... as valuable as fast [laughter] and having us get there first you know we recognize that overdose with pasta opioids we have that tool in our two locks we can administer ... minutes count and when it comes to medical\nNo Lawrence is something we're basically it's an F. U. Penn for opioids is that a good way to maybe characterize it tell folks visualize what it is a lot of lives just said no so well I'll ask anyway [laughter] originally when\nAn arcane came out that's exactly what it was actually had to drop the medication you'd have to give that to them but we haven't nasal spray that we're using within the police department and so he's looking at it as we just take it out like that in that one of their nostrils\nAnd administer the medication\nNow let's see what is it do I mean obviously it ... it takes you from a from a dire situation that gives you time but I mean doesn't restrict the heart I mean how does this thing work so\nWhen someone em as possibly overdosing on opioids for the opiates do is they bind tourists after and the brain on and they it gives you that high that you're searching ... well what can does is it comes into your blood system into those receptors and knocks off they'll play it's those receptors\nAs a bully pushes them off and in mind so that way you can't get that high and it starts restoring your bodily functions basically took her you know you start breeding better I'm the only issue is that sometimes\nWhen you administer and you know\nYou\nDon't have I I Would say I mean that sorry not hired by the time is that because sometimes and arcane can wear off okay and you need to have you know okay I didn't minister and arcane now when I Do now you start CPR because they're still not breathing ... takes a couple of minutes and really kick\nIn and this isn't a stopgap I mean there's just essentially gets you the officer time to get that person yeah into the ambulance end to the hospital where they can really hurt you and that while I'm really trying\nTo push it it's not a save all it's not going to carry her overdose it gives us a little bit of time planning on how potent whatever you took was into the hospital and that's an orange shirt\nGotcha with the news last week some numbers released like in twenty Fifteen there were so many calls and and then twenty Seventeen I mean those calls almost doubled and has time so I mean why why is it important to have this tool on your belt was to in your arsenal\nIt's just it's going to help save lives I mean no one wakes up oh I'm gonna I'm gonna\nYou know take my my overdose I'm an overdose today and no one wakes up I'm going to take some time saying and overdosing di ... no one has that thought process that you know some acts like I just want to feel well yeah and it's it's a stigma that we're trying to help break with you know people who have substance abuse issues\nUm and mental health issues were trying to break that stigma\nKnow Laurel I mean you've been on the force or how has opioids and how has you know the way you patrol when it when we know a world ... how does that change what what you guys and gals do in the in the police department\nObviously now when we come across any substance that we're not aware of what it is we're all trick cautious because we understand that a lot of the heroin is being cut with that and all now and when that touches your\nAny part of your skin can be introduced to your body and we're worried about overdoses for ourselves as well so not only Arkin is used in the public it can also be used for officers and maybe we'll have one of our lives as well\nNow is this something where obviously you guys are as police officers but it's it's something where our ambulance crews and are empty the bench we're going to get a point where they're they're traveling with us every time now to or\nDo they have had it oh they do okay so this is this new for the police department correct okay well let's see what kind of process did it take to have to I mean it's obviously wasn't an overnight thing like oh it's just going to Walgreens and buy some dark can and put it in every walk or take me through that process\nYeah so um we had some sergeants and some officers that you know their their research presented to the chief pay this is the life any effort for our community um they went through ... it that in our budget um and then once we were able to attain um they go in our AC's um we make sure that their temperature sensitive so we make sure we have everything set with that\nAnd then every officer goes through about an hour's worth of training on how to administer at some mess behind our can that way they're not scared on you know make sure that tell them hey that's not a needle it's just a ... and a lot of that kind of help ease um we practice with with that testimony in a test our can um alligator and then it's in our\nLives and just like a box of band aids were just throw it in the back of the car and it is it's nearly need there's like obviously controlled environment and everything then yup yup and\nWe're going to continue to do your education you know yearly with their medical training just because as first responders we should have that I'm In the best part is the stuff that we are carrying is something that a community member can go to a CBS pharmacy or logging pharmacy and pick up themselves\nOkay okay so let's take a break and when we come back you talked a little bit about mid let's talk about those if that's all right with you\nLinda Schrader along with us as well as ... two of the nicest people you'll ever meet have not arrested me
