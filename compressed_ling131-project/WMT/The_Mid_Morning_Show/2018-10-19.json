M. T. [noise]\nGood morning overall watch out for a handful of isolated showers that maybe around the area this morning otherwise mostly cloudy and windy the remainder of the day another mile day on the way to with a high around sixty two decreasing clouds tonight down to forty four partly cloudy very windy weather expected tomorrow high around forty seven those winds may go straight out of the northwest over forty miles an hour times\nWe're mostly sunny spectacular on Sunday with high is back in the low fifties\nThat your TV nine first solar forecast a meteorologist ... news radio six hundred WMD fifty degrees in Cedar Rapids\nAmazon's being leftist organization but they come to some criticism now and so they wanted to buy some good vibes all of their left us tax buddies by raising minimum wage of Fifteen bucks an hour but it didn't work\nThere in hot water over a video they set out you see they just bought whole foods and Amazon's head whole foods an anti union video according to his motive this video provides talking point\nFor whole foods managers the managers are supposed to explain that whole foods business model was built around innovations speed great customer service things that just don't get associated with unions ignoring the business model says Amazon jeopardizes job security\nWell there's a couple of US Senators into orbit on the warpath crazy Bernie and Elizabeth Pocahontas\nDashed off a letter to Jeff ... warning that the video could violate labor law you see you cannot tell workers that unions can cost jobs in other words management's not allowed to tell the people that work at whole foods the truth\nThat there's one thing this dynamic duo of crazy Bernie and Elizabeth Pocahontas Warner good at it how to avoid telling the truth at all costs and all these always wanted to do was buy some peace and now he's got a couple of enemies from his side of the aisle what are these people going to learn and joined us\nUm you'll get an update little later this morning probably by ten um we're going to go ahead and forecasts guess between forty and fifty everybody come on that way there's at least some kind of a lid\nBecause when it says guessing over forty you don't how over forty it could be so I just want to put a cap on it\nUm but yeah it's going to be real gusty tomorrow may impact the kicking game passing game for the hawks we'll see we'll see what they do with all that mostly clear tomorrow night down to twenty eight\nOn Sunday mostly sunny beautiful could be a tad breezy in the afternoon but nothing nearly as strong as Saturday with a higher on fifty three Monday mostly sunny sixty one and then just about all next week it's dry and quiet it does it like there will be a pattern change by the end of next week and into next weekend\nDoesn't look like a lot of rain but that would be kind of a cool shower eat period of weather more than just a couple of hours we've had this morning so we'll see what happens there towards the end of next week and into next weekend the bottom line though is it looks like October is going to going to start finishing out cooler overall\nUm that appears to be a slam dunk at this point it just depends on how much moisture is going to be involved with any of this and that still too far out for Halloween so don't don't even go there but\nWeiner just walked in with his mask on humanitarian where that in public there he is lower now he's in there so that now they're building the title a the entire population of broadcast park radio side days up to five there's five of us here hum wow\nI just said

tomorrow it to begin with and you're going to want everything you can hold that tent down and the people that are going tailgating and trying to light those grills up to um just be advised that when there's nothing we can do to stop it um it does look like it'll be targeted between about nine o'clock and three o'clock again right during the game\nAccording to some callers you're I'm sure there's something you can do to stop it because I had somebody call up earlier today suitable for those who told me that somebody called up upset because I said shut the front door\nA what the French toast Syria yeah exactly so you you've got to be able to control this when you I mean it's all controlled by the government you know that guy was once again I err on the side of risk manager [laughter]

harm or you know a ... year WMD do no harm\nI suppose we could try and put up the shield and try and but she would fly away tomorrow so our cat doesn't even have a back to it it's just the top oh I think that might not be a bad thing that is true but I think\nI can anchor it to the ... because we do the show on a trailer out of ... uh I think we can take bungee straps in Anchorage to that you can\nThen the trailer just go set a trailer flies away so you've got a solution kinda\nI'm hoping for doing it from the the press box but so far no one is that\nNo no no I I I I I feel and for you we had a backup plan last year 'cause it was one of those like rainy colds supposed to pour a games and the backup plan was will just do the show from the van night I'm like are you there is well are we gonna fit Andy and I and the broadcast equipment and our guests in the van\nYou know I remember we used to live shots with the van and now we use backpacks but you'd have the loud generator on it and then you get in there and like half the van is ripped out yeah because they there needs to be room for equipment and so basically to you and a seat in the ...\nAnd that's kinda how life rolled in the satellite band and we still have a satellite truck we just don't have to use it very often anymore I remember the huge\nOne years ago and what news star nine had the huge truck and then the trailer it was the satellite\nUm how many years ago was that oh God you're a little bit late at probably mid to late nineties I mean it was I was one of them weren't confusing with a nine point to semi no this is enough to nine point to this was an actual it had the cab and then the poll behind was the huge satellite\nUh-huh and it was this was the same era as the news ... tonight okay got it got an hour talking mid my understand how the mid nineties I think I think you're right it was news it was a news star thing new ... and a and the person that I remember this vividly with friends and it was the first time I ever met friends when\nI first time I ever met a man possible yeah it's possible it could have been that way before my time he was an old one and he was doing a story or something on and I remember\nThis other big old truck ... truck [noise] well we um\nWe also we run out of the semi down in Iowa City tonight yes I'm Justin is doing live whether Justin grits doing live whether from Iowa City West was the biggest games I'm Down there this week is west versus city yeah\nThat'll the boot happens tonight about high so uh where did you graduate on their own which one where you were part of the city I graduate city okay the eye and I remember that game and I think all four years I was at City Hi maybe once we beat west but\nWest was extremely dominant in ... when I was a student\nSo they were very they were ... and a lot of things when I was a student I remember in jazz band and we always would go right down to the wire with west and one year we beat him\nAnd the other ones they would just sneak by us and that one year we'd be in with her senior year we were just ecstatic when that happened is I Know about that rivalry it's\nThe old and then have West Virginia lane and get fined twenty five thousand dollars a bogus is that I have a Christian since coming up in a little bit you know I sat down early this morning and recording an interview and that was the first question was All right man explain why heard of such a thing\nNo I mean people rushed the field that's how that works in the right of passage especially when you knock off a number six\nTeam right yeah and uh when the number six team is barely even competitive to begin with and you're trying to which was amazing by the way when you're you're just trying to figure out some sort of way that you're just all upset about it and I've never heard of it\nI was shocked when we had that story the next day yeah 'cause I heard it on the air for the first time you're in a way way what just happened\nYeah exactly you gotta be kidding exec now cycling is off this week by week for you guys yes\nPanthers by the way it's a homecoming game for the un I of course being in the dome is going to
