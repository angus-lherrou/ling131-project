strangers and you know strange houses candy if it's good or not um\nAnd then the drivers who may be driving distracted so\nLots of things to think about on Halloween but we want our kids to be safe when they're out trick or treating a we always recommend going to neighborhoods that they know preferably their own neighborhood and having adult with them are going in groups\nAnd so that way they can be safe and um as far as the drivers go they just need to slow down this is a a big day for kids kids are very excited ... jet out even though we don't want them to shut out in front of cars they they get\nVery well and I really wanted to go there and ah [noise] yeah um as you mentioned the safe food and said candy or even when I was a killer go watch out for Apple's you're gonna get a razor blade and Apple's has that ever happened\nI don't know that that's ever happened around here we just recommend you know the people who get out candy just give out the pre packaged you know I'm don't as fun as it is to bake stuff for kids it's just\nWe have now and um yeah don't hand out toothpaste if your trick or treating you know even if you're a dentist don't handle little toothbrushes toothpaste because then you're gonna have to call Shannon because somebody's going to your house is going to come over and do an investigation and that's just a lot of people worry about it\nYeah I Know kids always want that that candy ... but there are lots of other I mean even little toys are gadgets that you can hand out so yeah paste toothbrushes probably aren't the most but you know they're\nNot going to win you know I have friends in the neighborhood now every year uh everybody goes up my neighborhood we get like a hundred and some kids every year just in my little neighborhood on the north west side do you guys are still do the thing where people come trick or treating a at the cop shoppers or PlayStation\nYeah yep we are doing an event again on Halloween on Wednesday from four to six PM and it's going to be at the center memorial park which is just back behind a police state okay seven oh one valor way south west yup anyone can stop by will have some um\nLittle goodies to give out and we also have something new this year quote international has given us the book so we can hand out a book to each trick or treaters\nOh about an awesome yeah so we're excited about that and we want that gets to stop by and you know every kid let's treat you can never have too much like they're going to read wild like chewing on candy yeah that's the way it's designed to have the kind of balances out the good values yeah see\nWhat's now that's going on Wednesday at the police station right off of a first street there um time what time do we need to get there and all that good stuff four\nTo six PM so we will be there will probably have a squad car and I'm like I said what books and good luck to hand out so they can stop by any time in between there uh take some pictures that they want and you know that's a good time because it's you know right after work right after school and we knew recommend going trick or treating before dark if possible because it's easier to be seen an easier for them to see\nAs a homeowner I'm ... I mean I'm gonna have a lot of kids Bob and Bob in through the neighborhood what are some things I should be doing you know obviously you want to make sure the lights are on if you want to trick or treat but we've got to be more stuff into that\nYes if you don't want trick or treaters please don't turn your lights on because that's what they're told to look there um and if you aren't going to be home but we want to give out candy you can put out a bucket or you know and just put a little signed please take Weiner please take to just to keep going but\nI Know it's like oh I'm gonna take one hand to hand full\nYeah not invite trick or treaters into your house yeah I just make sure that if you want to answer the door and they ring the doorbell just handed out to them do not invite them inside your house\nWhat about people who have like a lot of decorations on maybe like extension cords and stuff which drew in about the sidewalk gonna move out of the way are what yes definitely my I had at the only word or that have that so\nYeah that is a good a good thing to think about too so if you have anything of the way especially if it's going to be dark that some kids don't trip or fall um and again with as far as safety goes for the costumes we want them to make sure they're costume fits it's not too long so they're not tripping over it\nBut also we want them to wear a reflective tapes eggers anything like that to help them be seen better and make a flashlight addict\nAnd make sure you got to like get your designated adult you know somebody's going to drive around it's gonna be cool I mean what is it I've got the weather here a good says you know like forties so if I can be the warmest of days but you know you it's a lot easier to just go go from place to place in a vehicle right\nAnd be respectful that's that's why I just I Am here how old you are when you're trick or treating disappears you know of the people handout candy but also the other ... reading\nI a hundred and I think it was like a hundred and twenty kids last year a hundred and twenty think use\nWow that but I mean that was I was impressed by that well because sometimes everybody gets so excited like oh candy move on everybody thanked me I mean not having a good ...
