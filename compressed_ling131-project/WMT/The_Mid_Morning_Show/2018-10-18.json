still night that's meant to shed light and cut to celebrate and ah I hesitate and I ... for lack of a better word but to at least a joyful night if you will yeah spite the heavy subject matter\nIt is and it's really a way to honor um the families that we serve and to let them know that we're still here for them are still thinking about them even after um the horrible tragedy and experienced\nAnd that we are here really to walk with them through their journey however long that ... and as intense and sad as it can be sometimes it's also very rewarding to see how resilient the human spirit is anywhere and this is a great opportunity to witness that\nIt really well and one of our migrant family friends al white side funeral director for years he said you know it's it's important when people are there at the beginning but it's those three weeks six weeks you know twelve weeks after the fact that that's you know that's when the sports really needed because everybody kind of goes away and goes back to normal but you don't right after that happened ...\nRight and it's hard because people you know pop they've dropped meals hop over and they check in and see how you're doing like you said the first few weeks and then you know a month later two months later trails off later I'm so again we try to be there throughout the course of of one's great when just again ...\n... exactly this is
