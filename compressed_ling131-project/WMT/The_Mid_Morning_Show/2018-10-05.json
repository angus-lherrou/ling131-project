M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nThat's happening with any rain that comes through small creeks and streams they're going to rise main stem rivers are probably going to rise to just be ready for that tonight and that's just round one of what will be many rounds of rainfall coming across our area or we should see some more scattered showers activity at the very least on Saturday maybe sinks and breaks in the afternoon but right now I'm\nReally not holding my breath too much on that or we're going to stay with the weather here locally now for the hawk\nTomorrow at Minnesota it looks fine I mean cloudy they're cooler but uh no rain probably for the for the hawks up in Minnesota Sunday another low pressure system starts to a kick out of the Pacific northwest and that's when the whole pattern comes to a complete standstill\nYou'll have multiple rounds of rain moving over the same locations and the Gulf of Mexico was wide open for business on this and it's not just the surface temperatures that were monitoring\nBut when you look at the ... points at about five thousand feet up that's nearly a record amount of moisture coming in and so these repeated rounds of rain which we've talked about it seems like at least five or six times this year where we get stuck in this pattern\nComing across and that's going to be some we've got to keep a very close eye on next week seventies to start the weak fifty to finish\nAnd yes it does it like maybe next Thursday could be a dry day kind of like this past Thursday was yesterday\nBut otherwise it's a it's a it's a tough pattern to wrap your mind around because when you look at the data in front of you and the data is literally feeding back to you\nKnow this is so far out of the ordinary you know how do you want to handle it um that's kind of where we're at right now because keep in mind the monthly average for October is two point five for the whole month for rain\nSome parts of highway twenty court or above that invent some and then some and and it just keeps going on top of that I mean the record wet\nMonths in Waterloo for October is five point eight six inches in Waterloo that's the record\nWhich right now you look at the forecast and you go oh my goodness we could we can get to that number by\nMonday Tuesday and we absolutely could and so they've already had a record wet September up there I'm getting more record wet weather\nUh that just does not bode well for the rest of fall does not bode well for the winter time it just it looks like a real troubling pattern right now so we'll see and there's not much to compare it to either um 'cause I like to look back at the record books and say oh yeah this happened in the late eighties or this happened in the early seventies\nThere doesn't appear to be much of a match here [laughter] yeah we just got to figure out why this high pressure system is being so stubborn or die and that's about all we can run with at the moment so are are best advice is just take these rain events one at a time\nUm there's there's no sense getting too far ahead of this stuff and trying to time it out on Monday we're trying to time it out on Tuesday\nThere's just no point because you know there's a really good chance just going to mislead yourself so uh where it's going to take them one at a time and go from there I'm just be really really cautious tonight I'm for going to be out and about with any football games um it's especially important to recognize flash flood dangers at night\nAnd we have had numerous flash flooding scenarios over the past thirty days\nOh we had Indian creek back in September yeah we had Manchester back on Monday so it can happen and when it happens at night and when you got high schoolers out you've really got to use some caution with some of these storms that are coming across right now so we'll see we'll see what happens it's it's um I was just telling Betty our our receptionist it's\nOld Matty I'm Betty and year and\nShe let me see she's she's wearing friday night lights you're good for her that friday night when we get done go tell her that I say Hi I Will cause I got to buy your desk to go to this meeting now that I'm retired justice WMD so I I Will do that but ah as a meteorologist when you work in this pattern right now you sit there with with some sort of\nOh my gosh this is really this is really new and different to you almost have to relearn some stuff already it goes\nHow many thousands of acres are we going to lose um how many thousands of dollars in damage could flooding cause I mean what what is going to hang in October in October and so that's when you go All right well we had twenty sixteen in September are been there done that\nOctober's weird to have anything happening like this I mean it's just flat out weird okay how old you\nI remember oh gosh I just had to have been the year two thousand dish I was working in an old one and it was a football player high school football playoffs and we're getting ready to go to a game at the unity dome and there was a tornado warning and this would have been like end of October early November\nI just for some reason vividly remember we didn't get to that game because we were stuck doing whether\nYeah my uh my weirdest one was November twelfth civil five we had a tornado three miles west of jak trace stadium about an hour before kickoff\nAnd that was a that would have been in Colorado the ends Colorado Buffalo's yeah and they would have happened but when you go back in the cedar river and you really look at things here with their historical crust tab I'm looking through this right now\nUh I don't see much more\nAs to double check again at our next update I don't see much more than about eight feet eight point four feet in October anywhere so it's already running really real hot well nine point nine point eight six okay nine point eight six November twenty fifth of Nineteen Seventy one\nWhile that okay here we go October fifth of Nineteen sixty five ten point five one phage that is probably the highest because now we're starting to get above flood stage and yeah\nSo it's job security man that's that is it is and they are all it at this point I you know we we usually like to encourage people this time of year ... leaves\nYou just have to look down there on the ground down and if you try and rake them and they're going to be wet and there's nothing we can do to stop\nIt and I'm going to ask the gardeners about that tomorrow the lawn and garden show\nFrom seven yeah I'd be very curious to see the the impacts on on people's yards when you've got layer upon layer of wet leaves that you just can't really get moved out of the way and so I mean we're going to be looking down the barrel here ten days from now mid October\nExtremely wet weather and ah you know the one of the big a long range things that we have to keep in mind is that there is a ... hurricane in the Eastern Pacific\nWhich the models have been struggling with 'em but the general consensus is that the remnants of that are coming up at least in in a brass go towards next weekend so really close to that and so it's very weird weird pattern by one of them combined that floats that's what changed man I don't I don't know [noise]\nI don't know it's a it's going to be interesting that's for for sure around here well other than that Mrs Lincoln how was the play anything she [laughter]\nSo uh football games got to keep an eye out of the sky and everything yeah as we head out and\nAbout Italy yet and I wouldn't Minnesota again looking at pretty decent weather overall I think compared to the country\nYou've got clouds forties anyone of any rain I mean that's as nice as you can get right now in this pattern um Iowa State in Oklahoma State uh they've got an eighty percent chance of thunder storms down there at Oklahoma State\nUm they've already been delayed in rained out one time um we'll see what happens this time but uh their game tomorrow afternoon down there in Oklahoma could very well have some strongest severe thunderstorms and um the national weather service down there is forecasting their pattern down in Oklahoma to continue or Wednesday just like we are here\nSo we'll see then it's\nWild times crazy\nWe've gotten drizzle here yes we do we got drizzle and fifty two\nAbout you how do you expect for that to rhyme it just it you got\nYeah drizzle and fifty two nice word fifty at least in our airport I've got fifty one downtown and there were a few patches of drizzle when I was out earlier\nI didn't really see much coming back I Know the roads are still a little bit damp um like we are good for about six hours and after three or four start watching westerns guy for these storms are already strong so I wouldn't expect them to weaken one\nWell thank you sir appreciate you have a superb weekend I guess it's you and me again Monday right up you bet I'll be here my friend have a good one
