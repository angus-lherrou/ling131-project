T.\nSix Henri tell you when\nAdvice for cats and the national weather service says the cedar river in Cedar Rapids still cresting Sunday but lower than originally predicted now at sixteen point nine feet but still more than a foot below the original predicted crest of Eighteen and a half feet river expected entered major flood stage friday teenager from what uh\nUm that's the latest in a local side uh we've got a high probability of drier than normal conditions for the next six to ten days\nSo we're going the right way good gonna have to have some patients here because now\nThis is just field dragging time let me ask you to take a long time but hopefully there that this will be good though because I mean that's probably what we need as loving you know the freeze ensures that the air is going to be extremely dry yeah much drier than what it was and granted while we're not going to be looking at a lot of\nWorms to cause a lot of evaporation it's better than having more rainfall to deal with um even if we do have some clouds around at least they do points will be down\nA way way down probably in the twenties and thirties on this event uh for friday\nWill you are let's talk about being a smart whether consumer for a moment uh I Know you want to talk about public on warnings and stuff when there is something I must address with you OK uh somebody on the Facebook this morning a was using like one of those like apps that comes on the phone and not the TV nine whether ... stock ab ...\nAnd they're on that stock gap as a snowflake for Monday care now inciting panic by saying oh a living as it goes no Monday\nWhat no okay [noise] um no I'm\nBasically here's the deal with yeah see I told you sound effects today the ah when models are blended together a lot of these smart apps there is no human looking at them [noise]\nAre at the human is looking at it I'm looking at it every morning and or mid day shift which also happens to be looking at I'm gonna bring Korean too yeah guys are yet with looking at some of the newer data and showing him how to tailor the app we actually hand\nGo in there and make sure that the hourly as as close as we can get it to reality\nAnd we also do the same in our extended forecast and when you hit those days and yet the plus sign and it comes down\nUm you wind up getting all the details you need to know that they are as much details we can confidently provide on that particular day um something else about some of those ... because they're all model driven and you've worked in this industry a long time to you know models can flipping flop and that's actually part of the forecast process\nUm why somebody's really allowed in the studio hang on [noise]\nAnd I shut the door and still make a difference [laughter] okay so\nJust\nKinda like it's kinda like when you're trying to a fish around in the dark to find something you initially might over shoot it and then you try and correcting you under shoot it and then eventually you keep going back for back forth up down up down and eventually you get to the solution\nThat's how forecast models work and the flipping it flopping is totally natural within the equations of these models and so just two days ago the European model which is cited as being the most skillful in the world had over an inch of rain coming on Saturday yeah\nNow the European is totally dry so you look at something like that and as a as a stopgap user you look at that and you go oh my gosh it's gonna rain I'm gonna share that everywhere and then the next model run that comes in six hours later ... lately dry so as a user of that after you sit there and go I Can't rely on this out certainly didn't download the channel nine one\nYeah mess disillusioned because what we try and do is not only keep it as close to reality is we can but also as consistent as we can ... because we know people are trying to plan ahead and um we know that we even have our own plans I mean I I one time got\nAsked to you know do you actually follow your own forecast like that's when you out of them you followed mine is like you were right [laughter] it's like yeah I\nMy own forecast that they work asking you to be windy and cold or I'm going to tell my wife and kids St\n... you know we're not let you make a special one for your family and tell everybody else right\nExactly exactly though it seems like people think we do that but I keep telling them every time look what what goes on the air is what we also you know and I've I've told you this on this program to that uh you know my wife's email is right on the very end of their radio partners it goes right through her the exact same forecast goes to my family it's their\nPublic on warnings ... give everybody a refresher cause that kind of came into play yesterday\nDid um and and there will be you know some communication with probably gone warning Syria's I'm back in two thousand seven it was early two thousand seven the national weather service adopted this new way of doing um the warning system now back in the old days\n... thousand seven if you had a tornado warning out the entire county lit up on the map it did not matter where you were and it was a global you're taking shelter right now well you know what happened over time\nIs you would have how many high beast or shutting down you know how many targets door shutting down needlessly at that point so the piling on warning system was put in place for two reasons in two thousand seven first off it was put in place to make sure that the most likely threat area is going to verify\nSo if you're within that ... you're going to get a storm it may not be the tornado it may not be the hill core but you're going to get a storm and if you're outside that probably gone you may not get a storm and in many cases you don't even get one\nLast night there was extremely isolated but intense little storm cells that came across the area\nThe second thing and this is a real big one\nIs to minimize economic loss um when you have a a storm sell like last night for example in the ... two thousand seven days University of Iowa would have shut down would have gone into um the shelter in place\nAnd that would have been ... rolled ... two thousand seven I remember those days when I was in school when we'd have a couple of events like that everybody shuts down and here's the kicker on this\nIt may not even rain you know and so the winds up happening is two things\nFirst off the business or the institution has just lost a ton of money [noise]\nSecond off the false alarm rate is huge when people do that because all of a sudden there's no storm\nSo I took shelter shut down my business there is no storm but the key here is where are you in the warning or not mhm and that's why it's so important to look and see\nAnd what we encourage people to do is not only you know keep it with our station but if you pull it right up on the app you can see exactly where that warning is where the your location isn't it and if you're not in the warning\nLet's watch things but right now you don't have to take much action if you're outside the ... or know\nHow to look at a map you know I mean I don't say that the tongue in cheek way no where you are in relation to a map uh-huh\nExactly and that that's one of the big things out of the second thing here that uh is is going to have to be addressed and we work with our emergency management very very well\nUm the county wide sirens ... it it creates inherent confusion um when you when we found him for the whole county yet only part of the counties in severe weather and I I can understand how that's confusing everybody and hopefully there's a solution coming soon on that um I I Hope we'll see but\nUm and tell us solution can be can be done um that can cause a lot of confusion because ultimately in the Cedar Rapids metro downtown you know we heard sirens during our coverage and yet downtown was never in the path of that storm yeah not even close to me by my house one though you get the wire and\nYes it was so my my big thing here is\nYou know make sure you know where you are in relation to where these warnings are coming out and the other part about this too is um I actually saw a piece of feedback earlier in September that was the exact opposite of what I thought it was a person who was curious why they did not get a warning on their phone\nAnd I said well do you have your phone set to follow your location and they said yes I Do\nWell that's why I'm because the warning was out but not for that specific locations ... whatever she oh targeted itself not to alert you so there are some\nI mean there there are several county based warning systems in place and then the ah what's called the ... gone warning system in place and because both of those still coexist today we're still getting some communication confusion happening here um but my my bottom line is is the outdoor warning siren system is meant to making situation Leah where you're [noise]\nThat means there's something going on now take the next step to look at either at a television or turn on your radio or or get your app out are all three and figure out All right is this in my area or not because of the outdoor warning system is not made for office workers it has not made for people playing indoor sports\nIt has not made for people shopping it has made for people playing golf and playing basketball outside and playing baseball outside on the summer afternoons or workers outside construction workers that's what they outdoor warning systems for\nHeat is not for us office guys who don't have any windows in within the first place around at my radio boots so uh\nUh there is an important distinction here I I think there's still a really big gap\nThat we need to close between the siren system and between what's going on in the warning system and we work extremely well with emergency management both Lyndon Johnson county so um I I you know we we welcome the opportunity to try and make this even a little more little more can ruins as best we can to\nTry and avoid the confusion 'cause the number one phone call last night was why the sirens going off if it wasn't get my program back on it was why are the sirens happening and it's not raining and the sun is literally out right now yeah\nAnd that's how it is yes that is right now so that's the big long explanation as to being the way she only aware and looking whether you're in that warning or if you're not\nOur last bit of a new business on the agenda

bakery cafe or order online for rapid pick up a narrow food as it should be\nA deeper look at what's going on in court or\nWell the reason is because you've got one opportunity whether your are covered under your employer's plan like a like a many individuals a hundred and Seventy five million Americans covered under an employer plan or whether you're on Medicare sixty million people on Medicare\nYou've got one chance every year to select your plan for the entire upcoming year and so if you fail to make a selection\nOr then you've lost that opportunity you're going to stay with a plan that you currently have your current plan might have had changes or you might have other options available you are a viable to you that now better serve your knees so it's at one time of year that you've got the opportunity to flex your health care coverage for the entire next year\nI Hope you'll forgive my now you have any here but why is it only one time of year why why do you only just get this one chance to do it for the next year\nWell you know there's a lot of different reasons for that and it really depends on what type of plan you have\nBut essentially a and allows insurers and individual is an opportunity to\nHave a consistent coverage with a consistent network for an extended period of time or some of it is federally mandated some of it as mandated by states some of it is I just how how insurance works in general I wouldn't be good for really for anybody to change or playing every single month then and\nThen you've got to get your doctors on board and your pharmacist and there's different deductibles and co pays that change all that kind of time so having a consistent planned for an extended period of time allows the whole health care system to work better\nHealth insurance marketplace and or individual state exchanges that basically November one to December fifteenth for most people so now's the time you you kind of what started looking through options and you know and ask your age are person or what should we be doing now leading up to the opening window\nSill mentioning that the state to state exchanges that's that's a good edition in there so there's really a three different scenarios that people might find themselves in this fall where they've got to make a decision that first is it they're covered by their employer under an employer coverage plan\nThose people typically have about a two week period just like you mentioned I see in the signs in the hallway he generally have about a two week period between September in December where you have to make your selections are for the coming year if you're on Medicare you've got from October Fifteen to December seventh can make your decision\nAnd then if you're if you ah have individual coverage that you buy through the state exchange that November first to December fifteenth saw a lot of different dates in their depending on what your situation is\nImportant to understand which dates a affect you so again that's employers set their own dates is generally a two week period between September and December\nOr if you are on Medicare the dates or October fifteenth to December seventh that you've got a major selection if you're on a state exchange buying individual coverage is November first to December fifteenth\nAnd generally all that coverage is going to take effect starting January\nFirst um this is also a good time to plan ahead let's say maybe you're looking at a having a baby in the next year here maybe you've done surgery coming up how would that affect what you're looking to do as you get enrolled and ready to go into twenty Nineteen\nYeah so when you're looking at your coverage options you really need to look at three things the first thing is choice\nI look at what options you have and what is going to fit your needs think of think of those things those upcoming health care needs that you know you have to look at the plans that you have available to you there is no one size fits all planned so just because\nA spouse or a coworker our friend has a specific plan doesn't mean it's going to be the best plan for you and your individual needs or your family needs to look at the choices that you have the other is care you want to make sure that your providers are a network that doctors and hospitals that you want to go see the pharmacies that you want to go uh go to\nMake sure that the plant has the benefits that you're looking for\nA whether you're looking for you know things like\nGym memberships if you're on Medicare or if you're I'm looking for additional coverage like dental and vision make sure you get the plants that are going to fit your needs and the next is experience healthcare can be a complex and confusing thing\nThat's why it's important to think about uh the experience that you're going to get with your plan and make sure that you take advantage of the resources they have available to help you live healthier and make the most of your plan benefits\nJake Robert's with us United healthcare talking some open enrollment it's is the season almost as soon as they when they start rolling up the Christmas trees that your favorite store we start rolling up the nice open enrollment posters around here and W. M. T. ah prevent financial surprises I think this is a big one because everybody knows\nHow expensive healthcare is I had a kidney stone in July costs twenty some thousand dollars for that surgery and luckily you know insurance you know once you get your out of pocket maximum\nIf I didn't have that old boy I'd be selling my other kidney to pay for it I think\nYeah so one of the things you need to make sure to do is to avoid those unexpected surprises is understand the terms that are involved with insurance and what those options really are so you can go to U. H. seat open enrollment dot com and get a lot of educational resources there to help you really understand what those\nThose terms I mean you're always going to get a bill or an exam or explanation of benefits from the provider that says this procedure or or this visit costs this really crazy high amount of money and then there's going to be a second call on that says\nAh this is what we actually built to your insurance and the third call them is going to be what you have to pay for it but understanding terms like\nA deductible or co pay or co insurance is before you go into making that decision is going to help you know what what's going to happen in that scenario if you know what co pay means\nAnd you know you have a five dollar co pay when you go see your primary care physician you know no matter what that bill says they send you you're going to have to pay five dollars likewise if you know\nWhat deductible means a lot of employer plans now have deductibles you understand then you're going to have to pay one hundred percent of the costs are to that point\nSo really checking out your options and uh learning what those terms mean that is going to help you avoid those unexpected surprise and understanding what your options are obviously you didn't plan on having a kidney stone a but\nIt's a some things you you can play it on like you mentioned having a baby is something that you can sometimes plan on or if you know that you've got a need a new replacement or a hip replacement sometimes you've got scheduled medical things that you know are coming up\nAnd really taking those into consideration when you're looking into your plan is going to help you avoid does unexpected surprises\nA lot of these plans now Jay 'cause you know they offer additional benefits like for example you get a health care spending account we here and get a a free flu shots one free flu shot as well and that's just some of the things that these plans offer as an addition to what you're paying for it's kind of almost like an added bonus and at some point\nExactly and that's that's really what you need to look for when you're looking at that care what benefits are important to you many employer plans now have long this programs for example United healthcare has a program called United healthcare motion it's a wellness program where\nUh where people that are covered during a United healthcare employer plan can earn up to a thousand dollars\nAnd in China than a year for wearing a fitness tracker and meeting daily washing or\nA Medicare Advantage plan for example can include things like free gym memberships\nEye or a dental coverage or million coverage so important to think about those extra benefits that you want and look beyond just the the premium and the co pays and the maximum amount of pockets and really look at the whole plan and what value that can bring to you at work and how to maximize those benefits\nBefore we kind of part ways here we've covered a lot of stuff for folks maybe not able to write as fast as they are listening here give me a great website gave me a resource where people can go maybe some answers and questions and all that stuff and kind of navigate their way through this uh sometimes tricky journey they're about to take\nYeah show you age the open enrollment dot com it's gonna be a great resource that's got to give a lot of general information whether a no matter what situation you find yourself in and they'll be able to direct you depending on your specific situation from that website\nI Choose more specific a more specific planet formation and auctions as well so that you actually open enrollment dot com for tips resources and information\nOn insurance in general and plans in your area\nJake appreciate the time I Know it's a busy time for you guys and gals over there but I'm sure we'll circle back the wagons and talk again soon as we get closer to the dates\nYeah thanks for having a shutdown you bet Jake Robert's with us United healthcare on the air talk a little insurance ...
