keeps probing Brett Kavanaugh's past I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and Republican Senator Jeff flake who led the charge says he wants to be sure\nMhm what's that all about yeah it's something so what's going on those wondering why the heck yeah is this pattern so rainy a so those familiar with the jet stream that river of error way above us um it it kind of steers things\nAnd it also is a kind of a boundary between warming cooler in any case ah there's a big area of high pressure above a above us over the southeastern us or the eastern us and a big trough of low pressure off to our west\nSo the orientation of the jet stream is such that it goes dipping south in the western us and it comes back to the north and the eastern us\nOver us it's coming from the southwest and that kind of transition zone now because it's pattern is\nExtremely strong for this time of year these areas of highs and lows are very very intense for this time of year essentially um and they're not moving so all these weather systems have to go between there which\nIs right over us and they keep coming basically every twenty forty thirty six hours so what that means is we have these frequent rain chances now is it a situation where\nYour neighborhood gets rain every single one of those days not necessarily um but in eastern Iowa there is a likelihood of rain at least at some point every single one of those days\nAnd we do not need more right now are for those of you in far southern Iowa thinking okay you know we still have a drought situation sure but you know I I didn't grow up in a farm but I have farming in my are farmers in my family and and you know you you have a farming background do\nEven if you're in a drought situation ... this time of year you still don't want rain no right no I mean 'cause you got to get to step\nOut of the ground and that's heavy stuff too right like friends when story yesterday talking about you know Rutgers poll and tractors and combines out of money ... thank you for the new tip on that by the Iraq War thank Peterson but I'll take credit\n[laughter] or whatever [laughter] um but like there was a the one farmer who spent how many thousands upon thousands of dollars by special tires just so he can get in the ...\nI mean that's it you already have low margins to begin with and he comes and even lower now right so it's like this is just not good you know uh and ... and there is no end in sight so\nIt's going to be a significantly delayed harvest for a lot of places and well just talking to a guy this morning on the phone who works for a like a lawn mowing service and his boss was trying to find a place to send his crew that Mrs up by like by the Farley do you hear him\nAnd he's like you know is there anywhere and like\nYou said as soon as you take a lawnmower out in these places and they have you know the the the bigger well if you're thinking of the ground yep so my lawn\nMower I turn the the auto more off because we're doing some back yard work and stuff but it's like I don't even want to turn it on because it it's been getting stuck yeah there was a mud hole behind my fence or that goes along a Tutsi boulevard you know it's just the the little thing gets stuck I couldn't imagine having a tractor our lawn try\nYeah oil mode my front yard two weeks now let me to be cut but I like I ... bridge dry out way to try out exactly so sorry neighbors that my lawn is looking little scraggly but I Can't do anything about the weather they'll get\nOver it yeah exactly the same boat as you are I'm sure oh yeah hardened upon and I um I saw pictures yesterday up in West Delaware I you've been in Manchester before that the football fields underwater yeah I mean places that don't normally get underwater and three to four inches of rain already saturated ground will do that\nYeah it uh we had a picture from somebody\nOh over by new Vienna I Believe in Dubuque how much better than old being ... at home and I believe that's where it was and uh they've lived on where they are for what did she say like forty five years and there was water and places that she said we've never seen it here and I'm so they were in the bull's eye of very heavy rain yesterday so [noise]\nYeah and there's more coming and when you add up what's coming over the next week plus it could be another four plus inches\nAnd there are going to be some locally higher amounts I mean we've seen what the rain yesterday did and it's not like you looked at radar yesterday and thought oh man that's that's just coming down like cats and dogs I'm going to be six inches of rain knows yellow but it was such efficient Raymond ... producers there are so saturated\nAnd tomorrow you on on top of it are you going to be muggy yeah though you've got more humidity and then what does that mean for our storm chances for tomorrow then too\nYeah well we have a cold front that sweeps through late tomorrow so are we going to be having some thunderstorms mainly late tomorrow into tomorrow night\n... could be heavy rain producers they should be moving along which will help but still in an hour's time you could have a couple of there's a couple of inches of rain the way it's looking I in a dish and there's a severe risk coming up late tomorrow into tomorrow night as those storms come through thankfully yesterday's did not materialize\nWhich is fine with me because we had enough going out to begin with [laughter]\nUm but yeah so Tamara looks like a more likely scenario to get some severe weather not a guarantee as is always the case but it is something we we'll watch for\nIn the meantime for days and patches drizzle are still possible otherwise cloudy a forecast high right now is about sixty I'm probably going to have to lower that a tad a some scattered showers tonight as temperatures rise looking at about eighty one for a high tomorrow\nChance of showers and storms late breezy south wins twenty to thirty miles an hour showers and thunderstorms likely tomorrow night and again those ones in the evening into tomorrow night maybe severe with heavy rain as well\nThat front goes south on Thursday so showers and storms chances are mainly later in the day as that front begins to live back to the north mid fifties on Thursday than we have showers and thunderstorms likely on friday with highs and the upper sixties\nSixteen this weekend there was a chance of a shower or storm on Saturday a better chance on Sunday more of those are still around Monday and Tuesday of next week with highs and the sixties again high probability of several inches of rain or in the state over the next week applies I guess looking at this way it's not smell\nOh gosh I don't even say that well and here's the thing and it's not like I Want to alarm people because it's not like my job is not to be like everybody freak out yeah that's that's the that's the last thing I Want to do [noise] um but in in general when we have a wet fall\nEven if the winter has normal precipitation that sets the stage for a higher chance of spring river flooding that I'm not going to say that's a guarantee I'm I'm I'm not going to sit here and say we're going to flood into spring because I don't know that but\nWhen we have this much wetness going into wintertime I just don't like the odds of what the springs going to do yeah so I mean we'll just have to see what happens then again there is nothing we can do about it right now so is no reason to say oh my God but just in the back of your mind as we get toward a few months from now\nJust be thinking okay what might we have to be you know considering as that time comes and maybe we won't get any snow or rain this winter time and we All right maybe maybe who know I'm I don't know

M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nShe still undecided I'm Dave Anthony Fox News Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski still waiting for the FBI investigation forgiving Brett Kavanaugh ... day\nTold me a little bit about ... and there was a press release you folks from Iowa college aged center yesterday called B where a lone rescue ... what does that mean and what are we got to look out for\n[noise] so this is students who have graduated and whose loans are coming due and the reason we\nPut that news release out yesterday is generally the grace period after a person leaves school is six months before loans begin to come do so we're really talking right now to students who graduated last\nMay starting in November they are going to have to start paying on their student loans which means they need to choose a payment plan and there are a lot of repayment options available but one thing they need to watch out for\nIs their companies out there who will say oh we can get your loan debt forgiven\nAnd there are legitimate loan repayment help programs and legitimate loan forgiveness programs but we want students to be aware of anybody who solicit them anybody who comes to them especially anybody who promises that they can get these loans forgiven because there is no guarantee\nOkay so there's no such thing as free money in this case\nWhen when one forgive and there is no such thing as a guarantee that you're going to okay\nElizabeth sooner with us a viable college a few questions that we got from listeners want to share with you first of all if somebody who didn't like qualify for a federal aid the last couple of years but they're still you know there are still in college and they still need to fill this fast in the form out every year I mean no matter what\n[noise] the only reason to not file a fast so we'd be if you're just going to say no I don't want to see if I'm eligible for\nAny okay and the the reason that they\nAsk you to file a new one every year is that they understand that financial circumstances can change\nSo we do recommend that people do it on the average time to file between thirty and sixty minutes closer to thirty if you gather all your documents ahead of time and if people go to our website Iowa college aid that because we have a list of all the documents you need you get all of those lined up you can zip right through this\nAnd it's not just need based aid so it may be that somebody doesn't qualify for need based aid but again we're talking about federal student loans which is exactly where you want to start you want to take federal loans first because they have the most borrower friendly terms they have the most repayment forget forgiveness options down the road\nEven if you're not going for need based aid you have to file that facet of qualified\nObviously misses this stuff almost like like filing your taxes but maybe not quite as intense where you do need some items you do need documents\nWhen you go to fill this thing out and just kind of give my listeners a little bit of obviously setting a half hour to an hour all us of time aside but what else you want to make sure you have with you when you sit down with mom and dad or maybe when you're doing this on your own or you've got everything ready to go\nYou're going to want to have 'em for instance driver's license numbers for both yourself and your parents\nAnd anything that shows wages that had been earned you'll want to have that paper work with you\nI Do have a little bit of good news do you like into the filing taxes there is actually something called the data retrieval tool that will let you when you're filing the FAFSA poll your tax information right over without actually auto populate than a whole chunk of that FAFSA form automatically you don't even have to and put it\nNow is is Elizabeth something where it's it's students in high school but even adults or is there like a cut off like okay if you're at this point in age you don't qualify for that\nNow there is no age cut off anyone of\nAny age who plans to be in college a year from now should be filing because the cycle that opened yesterday is for the twenty Nineteen twenty academic\nHere okay what what are some other good ideas obviously we get those files round but any other words of advice not only for students but maybe for mom and dad or aunt and uncle were helping get these things filled out give me some good general practice tips\nBecause you're right especially for students who are in high school right now there are probably some family members that are helping him through the process so fast that definitely the first thing you need to do about financial\nAid but you can also be looking for private scholarships and grants um talk to your parents just their employer offer a scholarship for children if employees sometimes religious organizations nonprofit organizations have these scholarships there is no time to stop looking for grants and scholarships\nGo back as there are some that might kick in once you're in upper class met in college\nSo keep keep on looking make it make it a part of your activities all the way through college to keep looking for free sources of aid\nGo back through your family tree see if there is a rich uncle somewhere and stuff like\nThat well that's one not one that has really hire more\nLives with ... with us Iowa college aid a dot Gov give everybody a little bit of a background on I Will college and what are we going to find when we log online and what are some of the ... of services that you guys offer as well\n[noise] I Would call a date is a state agency and one of the things that we\nDo is administered grants and scholarships as well as loan forgiveness programs that are funded through the state of Iowa\nAnd again it's the FAFSA the free application for federal student aid that gets you into any of that but we also do a lot of college access and awareness programs where we're working at the community level at the school district level\nAnd even at the individual school level to help students and families through what can be we we understand can be a very intimidating process of choosing a college applying to college applying for financial aid and then making that transition from high school to college\nYou have some of the numbers nearby like what is the average cost now a for doing you know a four year degree here in the state or just kind of like a round ballpark figure or does it does certainly very for major major\nUm it varies from school to school they'll have a lot on whether you're going to a community college or region university a private for profit a private not for profit and one thing we do now is that for all of these different schools the average student right now coming out with a four year degree in Iowa is carrying a load of about\nThirty thousand dollars or so and that's where we want to make sure that people are being released smart in how they repay that money is that doesn't have to be a burden\nIf you're smart about how you repay and if you make sure that you don't get involved in any kind of loan repayment scams it it is a reasonable number\nAnd that's kind of why we we gathered round the radio today because obviously with everything they're scams but again to kind of circle back to our original point here um loan rescue and and this is the money that has to be paid back but you're going to get what the limit things male you're going to get emails what are we looking out for\nA you might get yeah you might get an email you might get something in the mail just a couple of weeks ago somebody right here on our staff in the Iowa college aid office she and I were doing some research on these long rescue programs she did a little Web search and within hours her private cell phone rang with a robocall ... from one of these long rescue programs that are watching\nTo see but if they approach you that's a red flag if you want information about how to get your loans repay their two places to go one is the U.S department of education's website student aid dot\nGov that's for federal programs and the other is to our website Iowa college aid dot Gov that's for state programs you initiate the search and you go to those two sources and\nYou're gonna get lined up with legitimate programs\nIt's overwhelming stuff but it certainly doesn't have to be if you take your time and do it right\n[noise] exactly and because we know that it is an intimidating an overwhelming process when you go to our\nWebsite we also have a lot of free publications and there's one in particular I Would really hope that any high school students or families of high school students listening out there would order it's called your horse to college uh Seventy two pages totally free we will mail it right to you we will not do anything with your information except mail you this guy promise\nAnd it walks through all the steps of how to narrow down your choices of a major in college\nAnd when to apply for a for admission for financial aid if even got a guy to every college and University in Iowa including\nAverage tuition and fees places\nOf it the scary part almost scary than filling up the paperwork is getting the built in [laughter]\nRight we know yeah college costs have been rising unfortunately a college costs have been raised an alliance than the average income that that is why we're here to help\nIowa college aid dot Gov is the website and what's so when does the window for ... [noise]\nIt actually will not close until next summer okay by there are some forms of financial aid with the sooner you filed the better your chances so get on it\nElizabeth Cedric thanks for the time this morning hope we get a lot of people walk down in uh uh you guys can provide that to help and information that everybody needs not pull their hair out All right\nAll right thank you thank you Iowa college aid dot Gov is the website will take us a little break when we come back\nOn TALK a little food when they was mid morning show worldwide right aren't radiolab on line do you have your radio dot com and of course the ... radio dial news radio six hundred W empty\nThe news and the newsmakers morning show with Justin Roberts on news radio six on WMDs T.
