phrase incorrectly but it's a low low John I'll let you explain it because this is stuff that people are gonna get dialed into now that we know those colder months are coming our way\nRight right like ... the low income home energy assistance\nProgram or more commonly known as ... it's a federally funded program from the department of health health and Human Services to block grant ... uh which has passed\nOn to the states and get the states are then a follow their the assurances that are set forth in the in the statute and a submitted a plan and then the money's pass through a to local\nCommunity action agencies throughout the state where clients go in and make applications so OK okay anyway yes\nThat's and that was going to ask you at and yet we know the colder weather is going to be here despite the forecast thing might not be as cold all winter but when you think about you know the heat that's what keeps you said that keeps the house one that keeps the pipes freezing what is it John that\nFolks are so concerned with is it just that the amount of utilities that they pay the bills kind of where do you guys come in and help folks along when we get to these colder months\nYeah well we ... we take applications and last year we took we approved about eighty three thousand households for energy has\nThis been okay I'm a for instance a family of\nFour uh this year could qualify who made less than forty three thousand nine hundred and twenty five dollars a when they're when they're approved for energy assistance a grant is paid to to their local utility\nA which is applied to their account or for that ...\nHow how do you know or maybe ... when when the people and and this is kind of a sensitive subject because you know a lot of people there's that pride involved where I don't need that help or I don't want to have to ask for that assistance but\nThat's why you guys are here because that's what you do you point folks into the direction that need that assistance so that way nobody has to struggle working their way through the winter months\n... exactly yeah you could have set a better um we've got a lot of people it is a this is a this is a program to to come in and help people\nJust give them a little help ... ah towards making the payment of their heating bill uh the program begin began October first\nAnd eh for elderly those with household members six sixty years of age and older and disabled and then it will open up on November first uh for the rest of the state\nNow run me through the process John John Bergquist with us by the way I used what the department of human rights joining us on the mid morning show this morning John ... run me through the process how do I know when I ... in eligible for this and then where do I go from there how do I get that assistance\nWill they need to call their local community action agency a new could find that in your phone book or directory or online or under community Iowa community action ah association\nOr they would have a link or through the department of human rights or were in the division of community action agencies\nOr you could search that and find a location so I'm\nJohn ... with us here in the mid morning show this morning\nI talking about that assistance for for utilities and everything and we often hear John and yeah I Know you've probably heard it to where\nThere's such a big thing of scammers now are people saying on the electric company I'm going to turn off your feet on the power company I'm going to turn off your gas what is legally required what can utilities what can they do and what can they not do well\nIn Iowa we have what's called a moratorium law and for households that are eligible for life heap\nAnd our with our companion weatherization program I have to put a plug in for them\nWhen they apply for life he they are also applying for weatherization assistance which makes homes or a safer and and tighter a more energy efficient um they

Cajun country\nSo I'm not whether or not you ever have you ever explored New Orleans and it's a beautiful area there's ... part of that is exactly and that's this particular trip it's just stay out one week trip\nNext October so we're not talking this October everybody next October so October twenty to the twenty six for New Orleans and the Cajun country and we are doing the French Quarter so I'm One of our days has the French Quarter walking to work\nA Bourbon Street all those famous places that you've heard of ... and do it as I'm walking to her um the architecture is just so beautiful so you actually are going to be able to see it here about it learn about it as you walk along\nUm no we have some great music to a great music everywhere you know they leave the door is open\nA new streets street performers\nAnd and it's a beautiful way to be able to kind of explore\nUm I Know some people they don't like to travel outside of the United states they like to stay within the United states but even there sometimes there's some areas that they\nAre not familiar with and they don't really want to do it on their own well this is a great way to do it with somebody and I'm here all the details and and I just came back from a tour and I was just telling Alex in the car I learned so much I Can't even remember it all and this is kind of exactly the same thing so I'm\nA walking along and the French Quarter uh like I said the Bourbon Street I'm of course you know we probably are going to need some treats along the way worse yeah the the ... they have to stop for those\nAnd then also on that day we're also going to take a little crews um we're going to a so kind of do the Mississippi River on a tiny little cruise being able to see it from another advantage point\nAnd um then dinner at one of the most famous restaurants there and I'm In the French Quarter yet the next day we're going to do in New Orleans to her so one like I said just French Quarter the other one we're going to do a little bit more exploring of the New Orleans a also the garden district those beautiful\nAnd since I'm so a lot of history in that area a lot to see the\nEven the gardens um the gardens provide difference of course and different climate beautiful all seasons as opposed to ours and I are going to the October ... on October ... yep so be some beautiful weather hopefully we'll have\nA lovely weather and can't guarantee that every one so you didn't hear me Sam guaranteeing the weather but it's it's not a ... yeah they were very good chance\nWe will hear from a lot of the people I'm about Katrina\nAnd the effect that Katrina had on that area as we of course all saw on the news absolute devastating and um what it did to their community and what it did to them as a people and and how they are coming back in and everything and so an awful lot to see in that area [noise]\nUm and then something very special that that night as we are going to I'm a famous New Orleans a school of cooking [noise]\nSo ah something quite unique we don't normally do I don't know if they're going to let us actually try has Alex\nIs ... it might have been cooker but I'm a big eaters [laughter]\nIf you can eat you can watch right you bet mhm and you could drop out of the fresh from grits while you're known I I eat everything a little different situation [laughter] you'll have [laughter] you're not a fan of grant Lincoln you're famous people can see is nowhere near being grits [laughter]\nI'll Try it and say I try to go you're going to get it for that you have to try and you know what and that's\nThe thing when you were on vacation you got to try it got to try something new that things that can have the same old thing every day as a write up new [noise] so let's see here then we are going on to Baton Rouge and I'm going to also learn the history of that area you know this tour is really full\nOf of history of culture architecture food um it just has a a nice variety of things um\nYou know a lot of times that as we often do we think we know about that area you know we saw this on the news we heard this but I think when you actually walk through it and you hear it from the local people and you you see those things\nIt really brings all stories to life and certainly there's a lot of culture and history in that area and and that's exactly what we're going to see I'm also going to the Louisiana State museum and hearing all about their industry and their culture from that area\nI'm going to Nashville and a beautiful town charming elegant um that's kind of where you're going to think of those mansions or those\nThose wide open spaces the beautiful trees the pillars on the front everything that you kind of picture in your mind um we will actually see it and and certainly a quite different from our area and in the timeframe that they have restored beautifully so it it really will look like that\nAnd um so that's how we're going to spend that day [noise] ah\nAlso on our next day we're going to go in here about pre civil war history so if you enjoy history at all\nUm I think this is certainly going to be something you're going to you're going to learn a lot and I'm Talking about or that area and and who they were a\nAlso talking about the cage and um country now this was something I just returned from um Halifax and we just returned from a trip and they talked about it from the total other side a where the French Canadians um settled to New Orleans so it's kind of funnier in Halifax and you're you're hearing all about the French\nCanadians and then all of a sudden they're talking about New Orleans well that's where we're going his New Orleans and they are going to talk about the French Canadian and how they were resettled there and how that affected the area so that is why so many of your areas um even though you're in the southern United States and it's going to look very French because that's where they were resettled to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mid Morning Show", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "23"}
