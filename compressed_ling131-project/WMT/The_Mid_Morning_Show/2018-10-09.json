I can give you learn that ... I wasn't going to go with an actual time but okay see if you don't actually have to do twenty over the guy who won the ...\nUh it was nine and it was NASCAR ... and we had to cut in on the air\nForce storm and after about the the tenth call I told people it was more important\nAbout the tornado that was heading to the viewing area instead of a bunch of fast cars turning last fall no phones got even more active after that I'm sure I still had people coming up to me as I ... ...\n[laughter] was was that the sound of them complaining of some of the cars going room it kind of went both ways I it was very hard to discern so yeah so I mean we get it may I mean I Know we are as you as much you know we we we comment on it um no we we we really do get that it's frustrating and\nYou know it's one of those that I Would love to not be severe weather especially in October when it's been so busy anyway when there's not supposed to be\nUm but it is I mean that's just the reality of the situation that they're a policy is to be on ... and as we've as we've seen around here the past several weeks\nWe've had numerous little spin up tornadoes um and they happened ... easily and there had been a history of other storms last night producing brief tornado so he didn't want to be like wow all\nHappened were good ignore this one now we're not going to do that\nBecause the one time you do that oh God you know what will happen and I both know and every smart person listening to the show knows what will happen yep so don't even know that just just how the cookie crumbles my friend yes indeed yes indeed but other than that Mrs Lincoln how is the play [laughter]\nHow life I haven't talked since middle of last week\nAgain has been a little while um let's see I was over a cold for about three days and now I have another ... awesome so a hash tag fatherhood I'm\nSo other than that what else is going on um family pictures I get ... more family pictures on Saturday who have been busy with that oh my gosh Saturday we were up in Dubuque Saturday it was so Chile oh my gosh oh man if I can Sunday well that's\nI forgot about that yeah they did the especially for your race that was my first five K. cool so that was a a lot of fun um it was a it was a little chilly but my hands warmed up and that was good\nSo how is channel nine fight club going by the way between you and and kind and Christians in and Joe I mean I Know you can't talk about it but I was going to say it I Will number one\nWell see I don't know I Do in the extreme body shaping okay and I'm a I'm I'm just running a by tell you Josh Christians in his had some amazing results with it he he's been very dedicated to it and it's been pretty a pretty cool to see what all he's done I did the couch to five K.\nAnd anybody who's who's listening who is a you know thought you know I'd\nI'd like to do some more running but it seems so daunting\nCouch to five K. is a very approachable thing and it's not like oh well if you're not up for the next session and you're just terrible no no no you can repeat a lesson you can repeat of a week if you want to um there's toward the end it starts to ramp up pretty quickly but by that point you when you look ahead you're like oh no this is horrible but when you get there it's like oh\nOkay I got that I could do that yeah so um no it's it's a very doable program and anybody who's even pondering are thinking about getting doing some running I I'd say give it a whirl\nOr there you go yeah I I Would do it but uh you know I'm not a runner [laughter] I was never a runner either I hated running but now I like it\nWell let me ask you this ah here's one thing we both like and that's the weather on the I like to watch people do it and uh I like it when it's nice and sunny outside you have to worry about worrying about the weather ... what do we need to know my friend a\nWay to know that it's still gonna be wet a button ... this broad pattern is going to be changing after tomorrow yeah oh did you want the thing yeah OK do it again so this broad weather pattern is going to be changing after tomorrow [laughter]\nI wasn't and what does it mean we're going to be like suddenly drying sunshiny and beautiful every single day for ever and ever ... on the situation where we keep having the rain and the Gulf of Mexico is ...\nIt open to produce heavy rainfall amount that's going to be over with after about lunchtime demar enough for today we have some period of showers and thunder storms I think there are some signs that a good share of the afternoon may not have much going on\nI Will see high temperatures back in the upper seventies today kinda humid as well showers and thunder storms are likely tonight is a cold front comes through we'll see some locally heavy rain some storms could also be strong severe\nGoing to be watching out for a couple of things first of all a couple of brief tornadoes and when we say brief sometimes people are like that is such a weird thing we want to differentiate between the situations where you can get those long lasting strong tornadoes and the ones that have the little spin ups that typically don't cause much more damage than mug strong wind would do\nThat is what we have coming up so these types of tornadoes that would be Seventy eighty amount are wins associated with it that are similar to straight line wins\nI have some dusty wind potential coming up something with wins to uh to night with those storms is because the ground is so wet\nTrees may fall much more easily than they otherwise would it might be a fifty mile an hour wind which is not even considered severe to knock a tree over that may not have the best route system going on so do better than that in mind locally heavy rain is still a possibility some localized a couple of inches would be a possibility back in the mid sixties tonight\nWe might come up a degree tomorrow morning then fall during the afternoon looks like by about lunchtime showers and storms are over and done with\nWhen start to pick up without a thirty six tomorrow night partly cloudy skies sunshine on Thursday little windy forty nine forty five on friday moving loudly there might be a light child at greater southern Iowa on friday otherwise a slightly better chance comes up later Saturday and Sunday was highs staying in the mid to upper forties\nFor the weekend snow then right God some\n... I Would hope that uh right now I'm a river or let's get into that real Clinton uh 'cause yesterday was with us it was to Nineteen point seven now it's been revised back down to Eighteen point five or give everybody kind of a a overview picture what we're looking at for the next\nCouple of days yes indeed will continue to watch the river rise and one thing what the river forecasters those will keep on getting adjusted um I Would say once we hit tomorrow afternoons update all the rain will follow them it's going to be really of much consequence so the numbers should not fluctuate in theory quite as much after that\nUm but again it there'll be some adjustments as they get more information on how the river is moving a current forecast is a ... still on Sunday at Eighteen and a half\nFeet in Cedar Rapids that's a little more than a half foot above what we had the ... the last craft a at Eighteen feed edge would does close at ... so that would be an area affected assuming we get that level\nOtherwise we look upstream event and uh right now it's twelve and a half feet forecasters Eighteen point one coming up Saturday evening so invention we have about another five and a half feet to go that's right at the edge of moderate flood stage\nOr I were written Ringo you're just going to be near major flood stage forever it seems like a that's for at least another week\nI Will river at Iowa City that is going to be fluctuating it's going to be going down then it'll come up close to flood stage and go back down again toward friday then this weekend it's back and flood stage actually most of friday into the weekend or should be close to twenty three feet which is a couple of feet above what it is right now\nAnd that fluctuation as as they have out slow coming out of core of the lake and try to time things because ah with with the reservoir it's not just protecting Iowa City\nOr they have to consider okay well the cedar goes into the Iowa down at uh Columbus junction so we have to consider what's happening on the cedar and then all of that water that goes from the seat or into the Iowa goes into the Mississippi River\nAnd they have to consider how the floodway was moving down the Mississippi River when she was a fine balancing act that they're trying to take care of a to keep it below spill way and then not cause a lot of flooding issues are on top of what's already going to be going on I just will keep a dart board that's what I Do oh I'm right here he was the one who has to make those decisions on\nShould the weather break we'll keep you up and today it is October ... by the way today's fire prevention day\nBecause according to legend grid Chicago fire started yesterday it was put out today that's why now you remember missile Larry's milk ... kicked overland during the barn and by the time it was over three hundred people were passed unfortunately a hundred thousand homeless and Seventeen thousand five hundred buildings were destroyed\nSo we we
