democratic senator the other an ex Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nThey originate in South western sections of Canada\nThey don't tend to have a lot of moisture with them but man they can go wild on the wind and so that's the one thing we've got to keep an eye on still on Sunday I still think us over forty or possible here and one of the big reasons why is when we're forecasting wind speeds and wind gusts we tend to look at the air pressure difference because that's what's driving the wind as we know it\nAnd the wind flows from high pressure to low pressure and so the bigger the pressure difference across the state the more wind that we see in a forecast rule between say Davenport in Omaha work roughly the length of the state\nIf for for ... hours of difference it's ten miles an hour of wind\nAnd everything we're looking at right now\nSuggest about uh ten Mila bar difference in air pressure from Davenport Omaha\nSo that would equate to about twenty five mile an hour sustained wind\nAnd it'll forecast trick to find your gusts roughly double that\nSo it's got to be windy it really will we use that same trick last week and it worked pretty much to perfection around the area had some spots that were really gusty last weekend hopefully not seeing those intense gusts\nBut forty forty five monarch us I think are probably a slam dunk here on Sunday\nAnd while the high is at fifty it's not going to feel like fifty because that got the northwest when I'll be with us\nMonday very pleasant the wind goes down again next to nothing partly cloudy down to fifty seven for the high Tuesday fifty seven as well our next cold front hits us on Tuesday and going into Halloween should have a high pressure ridge around on Halloween so that helps us a lot with low fifties on the way for high temperatures maybe mid fits\nIf we can get some more sunshine and that leaves us Randy really good for trick or treat whether they're on Wednesday evening so I think we're going to over all be in very good shape\nMoisture star systems here next one is Sunday Morning at right along that cold front and then after that would be

probably about the same I Would think at least fifty miles an hour or so\nUh we're not in that boat for the hawks this week but it's going to be more wet than anything that would be very curious to see how are both Iowa and Penn State play and that even though there's not going to be a lot of wind a Penn State star running back and then the NFL now so I'll be curious to see what they're running

want to dip into a Fox News channel here and uh get the latest law enforcement source confirms one person has been arrested in connection with a packages that you've been hearing about the news over the past couple of days\nLet's listen to a little bit of their coverage [noise]\nAnd now confirmation from at least one of my contacts that arrest was affected uh this morning that the rest of us are took place in Florida and the suspect was a identify me as a male soft\nOkay we're looking at a picture here from plantation Florida will have to fill kidding in a moment are you hearing um\nSome of the suggestions from some reporting could be the uh the person who is suspicious here could have had a grievance were Debbie Wasserman Schultz because all these packages appear to have return addresses to her office in sunrise Florida have have you looked at that yet and gotten a clear answer on that Catherine [noise]\nI don't want to speculate on something that's significant other than to say that investigators have been very keen and on the similarities in these packages the ... the interior bubble wrap\nThe excessive postage the sex American flags stamps that we've seen on all of the devices and the packages that had been recovered\nA similarities with a bomb and then that's a return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz that was I misspelled and remember in the early days of awe of this um this investigation\nWe had the reporting that the device sent to the former attorney general Eric Holder his office it was returned because the address was not correct and then it was re routed to Debbie Wasserman Schultz office that with the office which was the return address and if you remember ... like a pick a bring up\nOne of the a photo images of the devices when you look at it you can see that also uses ... over the large a\nBlock black print and the reason that's important as that I've heard from multiple sources\nThat the large black block print a on any of these devices often has an embedded coating which can help investigators not kept saying with the naked eye but if you're looking at it frantically it can help them identify the printer lots [laughter]\nThat that that we're likely used on ten to print those labels and then you can get to a point of sale or a part of the country are pretty quickly and tells\nInteresting stuff that so they sort of piece it together bit by bit Catherine thank you for that we're going to\nAnd the other is the latest from Fox News channel we're going to be following this story throughout the day here a news radio six hundred\nYou want them to you but as you heard in the Fox news alert or just a few more months ago law enforcement source confirmed one person arrested in connection with packages\nThat you've been

there are a lot of holiday themed events going on not the least of which is the um Halloween parade through new bow and check villages that is happening Saturday Night\nBut I'm also we have one thing that's not Halloween related and tonight Maria mould our a famous for midnight at the oasis which is hard to say without singing it\nShe will be at C. S. P. S. tonight so that'll be a great concert and then flipping over into the Halloween mode orchestra Iowa is going to providing the soundtrack live to psycho in which a lot of people are dead and so uh\nThat's going to be at the paramount theatre Saturday Night at seven thirty and anybody who saw last year when they accompanied costs the block I was a great wonderful pairing and experience to have the live orchestra\nPlaying while the movies showed on the big screen so kinda hearkens back to the paramount beginnings as a\nCinema and vaudeville kind of house so that was very cool them down in Iowa City on Saturday Night ally orchestra is going to be performing the music to a silent movie that I the riots hey which has a French spelling but it's a German movie\nAnd that from Nineteen twenty five an orchestra has been in the area quite a few times and always fantastic they have electronic instruments and their junk percussion which is made up of found objects\nSo it's a little bit of the modern\nTouch with the old throwback so that'll be very cool\n[noise] uh we have ah\nLet's see red cedar chamber music at ... teamed up to do a series of concerts are called life and love are loving life and they will be performing their main main stage concert Saturday Night at sea has passed in Cedar Rapids and Sunday afternoon at the ... theater in Iowa City\nSo that would be wonderful

story about it the costume designer had all of these courses to make very intricate and by being in that intimate space\nYou not only get an intimate story but you get to have a closer look at the details that go into costuming and as a former costume designer I can tell you that that is a very wonderful perk that you don't often have\nWe still have a um\nLet's see what's the Addams family is
