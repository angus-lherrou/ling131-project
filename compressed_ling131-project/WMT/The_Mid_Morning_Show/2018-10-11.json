{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "As Taylor Lewis sealed the match with her twenty fourth kill of the evening it was Iowa's first win over the bad your sense yes November eleventh two thousand nine we'll hear from head coach ... when we return [noise]\nI'm a football coach Kurt ... fundamentals are the key to success on the field him in like a winning strategy sort\nOf being able to perform a basic correctly every time when you're driving the basic flu\nGoing off putting down on\nWhen you\nWhen I'm usually on we'll we'll think before\nIt goes bunch of asking was certainly proud of the way his team played and comments on what a huge victory that was for the Hawkeye program\nWas super excited for program and our team and we keep believing in them and they keep believing in themselves and each other and we talked about our preparation just ... who is going to take our best if everybody can contribute their best not better than they've ever played before are not something that never done before but just played their best and we find a way to grind it out and win\nLast week in Lincoln, Nebraska the hot guys lost three games to one to a outstanding Nebraska corn husk or program but\nMore history Iowa won a game for the first time against Nebraska since way back in Nineteen eighty seven and I'm sure there is more to come for the Hawkeye volleyball team as they march on in the Big Ten campaign I'm Rob Brooke sport inside Iowa\nWMDs farm the\nIowa State university professor in charge of their drink quality initiative you Charlie Herbert\nIs hoping this cooler weather will help farmers reduce the amount of potential toxins in corn surely why is it ... toxin for example such a concern for ethanol plants\nParticularly in Iowa a great deal of our DVDs are fed to pigs which have the lowest cholera for Obama to talk of any of\nThe livestock and ethanol plant will concentrate\nBy a factor of three anything other than start\nThat comes in with the corn do if we start with one part per million bomb I talk to them the DVDs will be three so that's why they're concerned they have this concentration factor and at least in northern north central Iowa\nA nutritionist is feeding the corn from the same areas that the corn to the ethanol plant came so we could easily have to start ... them in the same rash\nBottom line here Charlie don't hold wet corn get cold as quickly as possible temperatures the fastest way to slow down the mold growth in the grain so don't hold wet corn dry it as quickly as possible that means been dryers\nAt their maximum men of temperature and of course continuous flow was even better because it drier drives a little bit faster we haven't talked about beans but I Do think we're gonna probably expect fourteen Fifteen sixteen percent moisture beans and up for the rest of the harvest I don't think they'll drive back down\nSo we have to drive ...\nWe had a lot of calls about that air will do pretty well if we have any kind of dry air at all we should be able to manage this with high air flow rate ...\nAh remember two thousand nine when we actually had the dry beans in continuous flow drier no one likes to do that it's it's a very tricky process\nIssues Charlie Herbert that's foreign News I'm Doug grouper news radio six hundred WM to\nOne you recoup\nA big win at Minnesota hockey guys said back on the road for him to Saturday against Indiana Sandy\nPeterson and Justin robbers are here to set you up with the course like how much are of eastern normal bumper period derived from a W arms to studios announces from both sides you know look at the game the weather forecast from TV nine the corps wide cover cure a priest or novel\nOh I was just reading from your\nNews radio six Henri WMDs\nBack in Nineteen fifty seven were Jerry Lee Lewis records great balls the fire and the now famous tapes hours into the great falls a fire recording session\nJerry leave began arguing with Sam Philips says the songs too simple for him to record it to to talk loudly over each other still a fleet of with Louis to believe that his knees that could actually be a force for moral good\nAnd interestingly then this is this is really what kind of um [noise]\nSave the rivers so to speak here is one to two inches from Denison to Mason city\nThat was one part of the area that was expected to get some of the heaviest in this particular case did not it's still very wet out there are one of the highest rainfall total around the mid west laid on me eight point five five Kansas City metro\nOut Jang ... a lot that's a lot of rain and got and you're like a telephone ... you know like any role\nThat that was that was brutal down in there watching this morning after morning and I'm getting flash floods and everything like that so uh the patterns done now what we have to deal with is dry air chap stick season minded if you don't know where it's at find it or just whatever get another one forty for the high today turning partly cloudy and windy\nRight now we are definitely mostly cloudy across Syria however we should see some improvement here as the daylight hours do go on the drier air filters in from the west to tonight partly cloudy freeze warning is out for the northern half frost advisory for the southern half\nThe differences between those two are basically do hit thirty two or do you not\nAnd right now I'd say there's a limited confidence around the Cedar Rapids they're getting all the way down to thirty two because\nThere will probably be a few more scattered cloud that are going to be around here moving into the overnight hours scattered clouds at night tend to keep the temperatures up but the temperatures are so cold right above our heads to begin with how old are they um do upper twenties\nSo I mean yeah you don't have to go too far off the ground before you're getting down and to some pretty cold air\nUm tomorrow a situation with low pressure building in from the west however high pressure it's going to squash this thing here is it's going to happen we're going to be talking tomorrow morning you're going to see stuff on radar in western Iowa you're going to say I thought this was supposed to come here and what's going to wind up happening and there's nothing wrong with with radar\nUm when when the radar detect something that isn't touching the ground\nThat's just a function of how far away it is from the radar beam\nSo let's say you're down here the ground yes and that radar beam is that a degree usually maybe it's a half\nA degree angle the farther you go the higher you are from the epicenter\nSo all of a sudden something is is returning from the radar you're in the cloud based you're picking up some sprinkle activity maybe in the in the cloud base area but as it comes towards the radar site you see it's split apart or almost looks like a comes a doughnut hole\nSo the radar beams detecting precipitation aloft but as that feature is moving towards the radar it's no longer hitting the beam anymore and that's the called Virgo it's evaporation before it hits the ground\nAnd so we may see some of that tomorrow where you see it on radar but really not seeing much happening near the ground I think most in Missouri is probably going to get some rain tomorrow but not where we are what it will do here's a here's what ... is famous for it keeps things really cold\nSo mid forties tops tomorrow plenty of clouds around Saturday a nicer day partly cloudy could be a bit breezy\nLater on Saturday southwestern to the wind that'll propel us back to the low to mid fifties\nAnd then on the backside Sunday mostly cloudy probably breezy again somewhat with a high around forty four Monday high forty three so we talked about a couple of days ago on this program [noise]\nWatch your furnace filter yeah go ahead and get them change to get ill it takes men or two and just go ahead and get it done because you're going to have to fire this unit up\nMore than likely if you don't well okay it's up to you but you're looking at six days here have not even getting a fifty five degree yeah so that's that's that's a hall that mean that that gets to be tough\nUm towards the end of this next week seven to eight days from now ... up or fifties to lower sixty some of the long range trends that are are definitely in high demand right now as to what probabilities do look like out in this distance I'm In the age of fourteen day and\nThese six to ten day outlooks from the climate Prediction Center it's suggests that things are going to be strongly trending drier which is really good news for us extraordinarily good news for us in fact I'm not sure if you're aware of this but ah they climbed British and Senate does do an interactive chart\nOn their website and and you can pick any city you'd like and it can break it down into above below or near normal precipitation\nAnd uh it's just a sliver it's eleven percent chance of above normal fifty six chance below normal thirty three near normal so saying there's a chance I'm saying there's a chance in a really good chance to stay real real dry over the next or even a week or maybe to\nAs long as this pattern continues some signs of more moisture down in Texas New Mexico area um as long as these parade of high pressure systems in kind of happened that's going to be a good thing a hurricane Michael as destructive as what it was in Florida I really was the trigger to help break this pattern\nBecause that's what kind of allowed the whole atmosphere to reset and now as you'll notice with the wind out the door things are moving west to east again I'm just like they're supposed to be doing here across the Midwest\nUm by the way a temperatures are still really quite down there in fact upper thirties and low forties is where we sit right now in terms of our temperatures\nThe wind chill numbers are down there to where it thirty seven Waterloo thirty nine at these now we airport when it comes right down to those wind chill numbers though feels like twenty eight in Waterloo wind chill of twenty eight in Cedar Rapids to the wind chill out and I would say\nAll right question for you yeah um do you want to talk about pizza or you want to talk about a lottery you get the call today\nI think pizza it'd be fun\nToday is national sausage pizza day eyes um if you were to order a pizza Mr ... for you and the girls what kind of pizza you get regular deep dish Chicago style and what is on it [noise]\nUh well I can tell you the toppings right now the beef and cheddar pizza ooh that's what it is because my girls like all that um as for the crust style mhm that's tough\nI ... [noise] what what what the heck deep dish I boy deep dish I'm I'll be in a food coma regardless of whether because they'll either eat too much of it too fast or too much of it over a period of time so it'll be putting me in a coma anyways let's just go the whole thing deep dish beef injure\nChicago style ... hamburger green pepper and onion\nThat that would be good um you will a ... acid nearby oh yeah\nYeah for that one yeah definitely want to need that noted that that that's a that's a nice flavor right there and have you ever had a Canadian Bacon sauerkraut pizza I don't like crowds okay I like pineapple Canadian Bacon and pineapple before which is one of my top favorites I actually\nI've had one I'm actually not too far away from where you guys live um there's a pizza joint that has a Canadian Bacon pineapple\nAnd Mandarin oranges yeah\nI Know what you're talking to you know I bet you do I it took me a while to figure it out yeah but I Know what you're talking about now because they are right down the road from me and we haven't been there a long time\nBeen there in a really long I think last time I was there you weren't even married yet how long ago that was that could be Americans eat approximately one hundred acres of pizza a day or three hundred and fifty slices per second nice\nI could see that each person in America eats about forty six pizza slices a year party style or triangle ooh I don't know it doesn't say I'm going to guess drawing all the average pizzeria uses roughly fifty five pizza boxes per day that's really yeah\nOkay well I you know I guess pizzeria we consume around two hundred and fifty one million seven hundred and Seventy thousand pounds of pepperoni every year\nAll write something about pepperoni really liked it a lot as a kid ... not a fan now yeah same here I don't know I don't I Can't explain to you why I really don't know why greasy maybe that's it that's my choice in my body saying I Love you to live to at least forty [laughter] funny you mentioned\nThat because there is a recipe this weekend I'm making for the the hawk eye apart even have the house it takes a whole stick of butter I'm like oh I don't know about that well you don't want to learn about actual in it then that's drills at least at least a pure product you're putting their chicken noodles and butter oh that's an there's nothing wrong with that\nWhat what is it you know a probably a large portion role yet it's still the crock pot that's fine in Japan some of the most popular ... pizza toppings are squid\nAnd Mayo jago which is essentially manny's potato in bacon\nI could see the mayor ... ... I'm not a big you know ... aside from fish yeah everything else I really don't do out of the water um I don't do as good at all clam chowder used to like when I was a kid and I now I don't like any I don't like it now for whatever reason um I've grown I've grown to the one of the top food groups\nHow has to be chilly yep and at that time of year when I was a kid\nDid not like chili when I was ten or eleven ... and it really it clicked over the past five years I think when I realized how much I could eat of chili that's just absolutely dirt cheap to make it oh yeah\nIt did just stretches your dollar some nicely and you've got a slow cooker at home why wouldn't you do it again I go and what I Do is I use the deep freeze and I'm Still working out of Chile portions from\nThis would've been late August so I got one more dish out there before we can to remake the whole bag again like a\nCatalyst hang from Tyson's in Philadelphia the ingredients and what do you do on a going to find the sales take advantage real sales absolutely two more points on pizza a top five pizza sales days are Super Bowl Sunday New Year's eve Halloween the night before Thanksgiving and New Year's day\nHuh Halloween wouldn't have guessed that I wouldn't have guessed\nThat I wouldn't have guessed that either I could see how it's convenient because you're probably thinking candy trick or treating no time to cook you get a pizza and be done with the New Year's day is intriguing\n'cause most people have been been out late and they don't want to fire up the stove or maybe just watch them bowl games you know I suppose I suppose and then the last point Ninety three percent of Americans have eaten pizza\nJerry four hundred ... three hundred and fifty bucks has dropped three hundred and twenty bucks gives beer three hundred butkus got Kevin company two hundred and fifty bucks to your tail two hundred and twenty black kids go to a hundred black students harboring\nHundred and Seventy five blacking stairs in H.
