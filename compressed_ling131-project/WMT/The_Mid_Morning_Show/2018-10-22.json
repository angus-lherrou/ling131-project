I'm Sorry [laughter]\nNot that not the tree is an exciting it just took a deep breath and it turned into a yawn\nThat's how I really like this thing is a very vivid yellow as long as it can turn

red ones on the side oh little smaller ones city planning a couple of years ago yeah and then along the the ... the curb below the lawn is still green um but I don't think I'm going to be moan at any more\nI think yeah Don I did my my front yard a couple of days ago\nAnd uh I think it's probably good for the season 'cause I read I don't know if there's any truth to this um but once you get to like a soil temperature about fifty supposedly yeah it's about the time that grass starts to go dormant I don't know if that's true and there's probably somebody who is a turf grass expert who's listening who's screaming saying you know\nUm but ah I needed to tobacco to spend like three weeks is I've ... but it hasn't really grown that my mind that\nI might mode just to chop up the leaves and dump them in the bag yeah but that's it yeah I mean and I'm you know eventually doing the the railing for the deck but I think we're just going to do that in the spring\nYeah let's put that off until spring yeah stuff we need to do it needed to repaint or our\nUm window frames and we were thinking okay we'll take a day or two off this this month because you know there's certainly going to be some great day oh yeah and the entire first half of this month was terrible or or or a new one of the windows and\nNice today I'm going to put the Halloween lights up very day to day we're going to put the Halloween lights by we I mean me right um the collective we me and myself and I and we worked together right I'm going to do that today and then maybe a couple of things in the garage onto a couple of projects in there\nI have a a a meteorologist colleague up in uh Austin slashed Rochester, Minnesota who put up his Christmas lights this weekend really yeah I don't he he turned them on I think just to make sure they do they work yeah um but uh you know it's one of those things that honestly it's not the worst idea ... see\nI like the Halloween lights yeah\nAnd then of course you got to take the Halloween lights down and then it's cold and then you put the Christmas ones I but I have a transition period because I have an inflatable turkey that goes in\nFront of oh there you go Thanksgiving yeah 'cause you got to you got ... ah his name is actually his name as a goblin ten Sinclair the third 'cause he's wearing a top hat oh where do you have to give him three names\nNo it it is it a top hat or is it one of the the what I Believe is historically inaccurate fancy hats\nFor all kinds of the ... you know the top at oh really this is a top hat he's very classy my stomach is grow you hear

... cell you what oh you might want to go get something to eat out of the thing that might even Hungary oh\nMaybe it's just a lot I just moving around there just digesting at least some digesting that's a good thing I suppose before we get into\nDays whether can I ask you a ... there's a story here today uh we we we do new share with a\nW H O radio in Des Moines and they did a story they just sent to us I'm going to read the first line I'll play a sound bite and then I Want you to respond to it now there is a weather related story uh here comes the contacts here says\nIt looks like we could have a warmer than usual winter in Iowa with that here's meteorologist Allen Curtis from the national weather service\nMaybe maybe not apparently not apparently he's not going to talk to us about what he was going to say something about it being above normal temperatures what say you serve you a chance to\nBreak this thing apart so this was from the or the climate Prediction Center their uh their outlook issued last week and they'll have another updated outlook coming up in the middle of November ah basically the idea is um you look and see okay what are the odds of\nA equal chances of temperatures being above or below normal ... or above or below one or the other\nAnd the general pattern suggests that uh there are higher than usual I there's better than even odds basically of overall this winter's temperatures being above normal okay now I Want to stress that winter is a three month period and ah it's December January February and that's looking at the average temperature\nDoes not mean that there aren't going to be any cold days it's wintertime mhm uh but this is looking on the whole it also doesn't necessarily mean that oh we're going to have more rain and snow or ice and snow those are those are individual whether situations between\nThe ground and five thousand feet up type things this is just looking at the broad pattern but they are expecting a or a week El Nino to form\nAnd there's a tendency in the mid west for El Nino winters to be milder than usual not always and again because there is greater than even odds of above normal temperatures doesn't guarantee it but it's kind of a lean that direction okay gotcha so don't you don't expect to be like Seventy and sunshine and no\nNo not at all no but you know it's going to be one of those things that honestly like this past winter wasn't that bad until we got to the part of the winter where it wouldn't end yeah like\nYou know New Year's eve where it was like negative twenty three\nRight we had like we had a those couple of weeks in January in particular I Believe that we're pretty cold mhm but overall last winter wasn't wasn't terribly intense or mental thing well isn't overly precipitous right but then April hit and it just wouldn't warm up but that was awful and yeah\nAnd then we had our second warmest on record spank rate\nI'm ready for winter man the Nuba day is
