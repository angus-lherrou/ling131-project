Berger was still in college oh while I was playing at Miami of Ohio and I think there was a\nIt was a defensive stand and Iowa State was never known for defense ... ever until the last couple of years and so we're all of this crossing our fingers you know hoping things go our way and it did and that was one of the neatest road games I've ever been on um only wrote game ever been on so I'm Glad it was a win and it was fun\nI've been to Illinois like I Want to Illinois a couple of years ago it took forever to warm up after that game which Champaign Urbana and it was just a cold snowy day just miserable I mean bad enough going the champagne Urbana\nAs it is within you're sitting at the stadium it was just to add some snow yeah al ... imagine being in Madison this past week oh gosh that ... I went to a Purdue I've been to ... um West Lafayette as kind of a fun place\n[noise] I never been to\n... I have been to the same amount of cycling road games as you have yeah you went to these little TCU oh man that was beautiful man I'm telling you that Texas guy and went out of the night it was some\nYeah and that TCU game\nI Love to have a possession back on that one\nBack on that one you know who did the halftime show and they didn't even publicize it no 'cause I didn't know Lee Greenwood [laughter] God Bless the usa grain or a PC you marching band I thought you're going to say something else no [laughter] I felt very quickly if you like walking\nOut of the stadium because like All right it's halftime yeah about a lot of them get something to eat comeback\nLadies and gentlemen Lee Greenwood I'm Wondering why this was not in the program\nOh man oh yeah yeah I'd say they've been able to hold TCU down quite a bit yeah by the way I stay plays Texas Tech yeah three and a half point favorite what say you know\nI like their chance I ... I mean I'm always wanted to call for the strong start if you get a good strong starting to good strong foundation they should have a really good a good day weather wise their names that should be dry for the game It's MORNING game so looks like it's gonna be pretty good\nI'm forty nine so we have for kickoff probably going back in the mid fifties by the end of it so overall should be pretty good like wind on multiple they can do real well against them I remember Texas Tech when I was student and just getting hammered by them I mean it was bad and now we can run right with them so I'm I'm hoping that we can get a\nA really really critical fourth when\nUh Iowa is a six and a half point underdog to Penn State which you mentioned the forecast since I'm not here tomorrow what say you\n[noise] um I think it's going to be a struggle okay\nUm my initial thought was tending to when we talked I think last week and the two would come from this game\nUm it's going to be really tough to go there and do it I think if Penn State was coming here it'd be a different story um I don't know I think it's going to be really tight\nBut the thing is this sounds kind of weird but Penn State did they not have sac one Barclay last year I said well he's gone and so I don't know who they're running back as I Know that they're quarterbacks pretty good but if it's raining\nDoes that take that out of the equation as an Iranian does it make the running game all that much stronger which was proven last week\nUm so I I think it's I think it's Penn State by three probably like Thirteen town or something really low scoring that is just my thought this is one of those\nGames where we all looked schedule like okay that that's going to be we're going to take a licking this one you know I mean it's\nPossible but at the same time you have one oh here's what you really need if it's going to be that close you have somebody from all the ball there I'm twenty yup chip in a field goal and they do the opposite yeah you know that's the kind of thing I don't think they're going to go over there and get embarrassed\nAs the great poet laureate that John Madden used to say I'm playing the game you know that's why we play games\n[noise] it'd be circled the boom right here [laughter] nursing home knocks the ball to him by the way law and more Brett\nFarr made it through yet another C O thank the

interview them I'm just going to sit back and you\nKnow so a coach and Tammy approached us last year and they want it to\nA get together to team up to conquer bullying and the community and so they decided that they're the rough riders decided that that is what they want it to do so\nWe met we formed a student committee with students from middle schools and talent and uh met with him several times and put together this program and yesterday was our first presentation and went awesome the players did well coached did well it was it was perfect we loved\nIt and just such a quiet guy I mean you you you got to get any words [laughter]\nI was talking yesterday out\nFor the week I coach I mean what's it like you I mean you guys and I say that collectively guys and gals with the rough riders\nAre kind of like a a an ambassador if you will to the city where and it's a great way to bridge the gap where you've got younger kids you're dealing with what Eighteen Nineteen twenty year olds on the team bringing everybody together where you've got young role models that you get a chance to help mold into men when they when they come through your program\nYou know for sure adjusted and that's um that's you know what are the things I absolutely love the number one thing I Love about junior hockey and uh we always say that were running a program you know what the rough riders not just a hockey team and we want to do it the best that we can to improve our guys as as people and also as players in this uh\nYou know this a deal that were running now with the uh the ... um is there's been awesome so far and I just full marks and I want to be clear on this this this was all\nOfficer Sampson and Tammy they they got together and got rocking on us and I'm I'm thrilled to be a part of it and like to thank obviously chief as well and um this is only the beginning\nAnd Tammy literally two feet behind me right now if you're on the Facebook she's putting this on Facebook Live right now so um but ... the chief I mean this is this dials right into what everything we talk about every month getting together and you know being a positive influence on you within the community and that kind of translates into so much more positivity for everybody here\nThat spot on and uh you know last year when when Shannon uh\nApproached us that\nThis was something that uh the rough riders and across his wanted to do it it was a perfect fit and uh they they took the ball or the ... whatever you call it a that they've attached a name to it and uh yesterday was just a tick off of a lot more great things to calm\nWell get with it being a kickoff that was me my next question is this is just this is ground level yesterday was ground level what's the potential for this what's the what's the goal as we move now and you know to to round two and into the third period ended up see I I got hockey phrases too [laughter]\nWe're really hoping to get out into other middle schools around the house and get the information out and get the players out there in the community they want to be involved in really\nWhen you think about it and just looking at that the fed through eighth graders yesterday outlets how middle school they were so excited to see the players there and they were paying attention and engaged and listening and that's what we want because this is a very important message that and we want them out to here and and remember and\nAnd obviously put to use and make sure that they are respecting others and you know dealing with ... when it happens\nYeah I mean it's and you hear so much about it and I think as adults I think we're all kind of guilty we we all bully a bit too much maybe it was we all should sit through something like this to every once in a while maybe you know start going from office to office coach with some of these players everybody's different office 'cause I think we all need to be reminded from time to time the bullying at any age isn't good\nWell I I agree a hundred percent and we've been thinking a lot about this and we you know we really tried to make the point yesterday and as you said even with adults I mean\nHow boring would it be if everybody looked the same ... acted the same and it's I think it's great that there's people have different heights and and different sizes and different colored hair and and and different nationalities and different accents and the people that have different interests and if we can bring all these things together and let's like look for the good\nAnd people in let's be great um you know workmates and classmates and teammates and if we can continue to spread that I I think it can become contagious and and we can do great things here in our community\nAnd coach or I should say chief I'm going to start calling you coach from now and just so you know when I didn't hear ah when when when mark and Tammy and when she came to us let's do something like this how do you take it from idea into now hitting the ground running with it\nWell that's all officers saints is doing and she worked very closely with the ... and folks in the school system to identify a the the students would be part of this team\nAnd present it and again I I I Can't say enough for the ... and a rough rider or with the way that they want to be a part of this community not just part an act of ... and\nA ... this is just one one example of of how they they they want to continue to be involved in a you know bullying as you said you know starts a throughout people's lives and goes from childhood to adulthood and and we see way way way too much and\nI I think by addressing it in the middle schools the perfect age to to really put an end to it and\nUh I think all of us see it and want to have it and but uh I I Can't sing for having the rough riders be a part of the um the young men that that gave the presentation yesterday and it just wild me that that uh\nYou know the level of composure in their character and just the way they interacted with these kids or you could see the admiration of the kids that they looked up to these players and\nOr the ability of being a positive role model for these kids are just fantastic\nBut and and coach when when you've got these guys I mean this is you know just out of high school some of these guys are still in high school when they're going through your program do they realize how big of an impact they have when they do something like that\nYou know I I I Do think they do just that we talk to them about it and and um I I Do think that they realize that and we we stress the community side of it from day one here and um so I Do think that they understand that and I think the guys yesterday they were I Would echo what\nYou know what she said I was just so impressed with with how they presented themselves and how they spoke and the examples I mean they gave real life\nExamples and I think the kids could really hold onto that the uh\nThe other thing I wanted to mention if I could because I just thought that this part of it was just absolutely awesome\nKind of behind the scenes part of it is as officer Sampson said we we have multiple meetings out at the station and uh there was anywhere from four to six students that would show up from various schools and\nAnd we said that I think it's one of one of the conference rooms and we would sit in there and and and an officer Sampson and Tammy handouts and and we would have open dialogue and discussion that um that offers are Sampson\nI'm trying to monitor it and the moderator and got input from from the students and then um and then this was the presentation was put together and it's just been a a big process and just really cool to see how it's evolved\nAnd she had in this uh this is a program it's not just a stop bio we were here we made it visit that this is something that I I kind of liken it to maybe a bowling version of bears and maybe maybe okay to do that something similar with that set up where this is a you know you don't just stop by what's there I'd stop bullying you come back and you do more visits right it's not just the ones in done\nRight so I Know the rough riders when I go back and I would like to go back to and uh make several visits back there just to interact with the kids and see what's going on maybe have lunch with them\nUm and just let them know that you know we're out here and we're there and we're wanting to\nStay engaged and and help them answer questions whenever we can sell yeah and I and I know all the salads excited to to have the players and the writers and have them all back again so I thought so yes we do want to keep up and keep talking about this and we don't want it to go away we don't want anyone to forget about it because ... happening and we need to put a stop to it\nNow is there a way for folks to get involved and say hey I think it would be great if you were coming to my school are my kids' school or I mean take me through a little bit of that process or is it this pretty much set up and there's a chart a course here or is there still room for input and everything\nSo we're still working on the whole program but like we said yesterday with our very first presentation and so yeah this is for middle schools or you know even in high schools would like it they can contact me or contact Tammy at the rough riders and we'd be happy to set up a presentation that's about probably thirty five forty minutes need\nAnd um yeah we had all the fifth through eighth graders that without yesterday and it was a good group but we do alliance\nWe do want the students to participate as well you know when the players are out there talking and engaging so\nLet's take a break here we'll go get a lot of stuff to get to this hour and Tammy I'm not going to make you hold the phone the entire hour I just saw you know give me a break from time to time\nCoach Carlson is with us we've got chief a German we've
