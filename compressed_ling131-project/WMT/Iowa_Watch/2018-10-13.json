I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they report it you know I'll go\nOut and he I Would wait Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving and like I think it absolutely outraged [laughter]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get\nOn and so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] while a you might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both have to have a I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you just go bananas it's going to take you a few years so um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks on those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's a fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not ... I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but as he got his way up\nBut um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] off for that's a good gosh so oh wow yeah\nSomebody so anyway yeah ... this was not an equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that is behind this now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game on and that's fine thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex how are you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a

about Fifteen to Seventeen percent in do four O. one K. wow no\nNot even out or ... or a plan that you've already done all of it [laughter] yeah it doesn't happen all the time really really good for you okay so what's your question\nUm yeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like Ron step six out of about ... ... mortgages are only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund programs for the question is a film about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it isn't a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we [noise]\nWe commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh paying down of the the mortgage and ... up for a um

held in Turkey for nearly two years is expected to meet with President Trump at the White House today angel bronze than you would have been convicted of having links to terrorism was released yesterday\nCame into the Congress in Nineteen ... after the Nineteen Seventy six selection of the Democratic party was dominant had been dominant in Congress for quite a while [noise] and in fact\nI never dreamed up serving as long as I did a\nBut I never thought I Would ever be in the majority or as a party and ice are uh\nEighteen years under democratic leadership in twelve years under Republican uh Nineteen eighty was a little bit of a break here because things started to get a stickier and part of it was symbolized by the election of one member of Congress and the prior election and this was Newt Gingrich in Georgia\nNewt is a was it is a very smart or\nIndividual and a very smart tactician a and also ah someone that uh believe that the Republicans could only gain prominence by being much more to deceive with the Democrats and so he\nInaugurated a program as a young member to a present much stickier set of feelings within the Congress or with the attacks that I thought were\nOf the majority party were um\n[noise] uh maybe a bit exaggerated live\nUnder stating the word maybe uh in my view was that I came in as a classic moderate Republican and the traditions of ice in our brain that sort of thing\nAnd I always felt that in the minority my obligation was to present a constructive alternatives to democratic offerings but of democratic offerings as a controller so the house of made sense not to be afraid to vote for them a end to try to modify them if that was a\nAnd so I Would have a whole series of boats that were a\nAgainst democratic measures and some votes were four of them are and I would try to play a role that would be contributing to rather than a division\nA but as time went on\nIn the eighties and a Ronald Reagan became president today he looks like a unifying figure at the time many in the political process thought he was more ... than otherwise uh in retrospect or a he looks like a a quite a credible Protestant\nOr at the time he was under the got a little bit like a John F. Kennedy was under the gun is president with his death he became\nA quite a murder and and and looked at in a very different ah\nMore enlightened way or in the same as kind of the case with Ronald Reagan and ah one aspect of Reagan's presidency that many people have missed is that uh he had a a contrasting I'm\nFigure in the house who was Tip O'Neill who was the speaker of the house in tip was a a classic a liberal Democrat but uh I always found them to be totally honest and he had a position that he would argue for liberal causes\nBut never was there an argument for a bringing the system down that is just functionality was not a term used\nA and everything was to go forward and he would win some battles Reagan would win other battles but they always had a resolution\nA lot of political battles happened over the years while leach was in Congress Iran Contra a savings and loan crisis nine eleven\nWhitewater scandal during which he was highly critical of President Clinton the Persian Gulf War and war with Iraq which he voted against but\nAlso the tone seemed to be changing in Congress and leach was taking notice\nThe speaker of the house for example\nIn this case I'm Jim Wright of Texas who would um\nPublished a book a that may be utilized some uh\nAides help from Congress a\nWell there is an jumping on him as if this was quite a legal Sam and yet a\nLater went in power or one\nOf the people who attacked him the same way became speaker and did the same [laughter] and so you have a a issues and get exaggerated and issues that\nUh [noise] and don't get quite enough attention or depths of of attention um\nThere are a\nReal um errors in the Congress makes as well as quite successful things than it does a and for example in the eighties uh\nWe had an savings and loan a\nAnd it was in my view directly tied to certain acts of Congress that\nCongressional committee ... six and go to tie into an industry and then [noise] um\nPut constraints and how the industry was regulated\nIn effect a allowing the industry to do things that were imprudent or in so many SNL some of the country went under and the\nFunds for protecting a\nWeren't there and so Congress had them bailout\nOr a\nFor [noise] a\nHundreds of billions of dollars and that is the kind of thing that I think one can make an honest difference in front of judgment on\nWhen things get real personal it's awkward of what can and cannot use ah\nThe personal attacks were big cause people just liked curing them what's going on there is a personal stationed all politics or\nThink about candidates for president\nImposing physical thing [noise] uh\nAre other people that get typed ways a\nMight be less attractive you are\nThe only true place for honest exaggeration\nIn the news media and consulted overlooked is cartooning a and\nPartly because of the use of humor a\nAnd partly because exaggeration can reveal\nTruce of character and troops of on an issue\nWith everybody understanding it's not intended to be precise\nWhen you get into a\nPersonal versions about people\nI have seen a number of the house floor of the or\nOnce a member of the United States Congress in an argument with another member which was a fair argument on the issue suddenly says [noise]\nPerson correctly and the only reason for that is because use are are gay will he voted a member of Congress\nAbsolutely outrageous\nTo make a claim\nMay or may not have been valid but he has no relevance whatsoever to the discussion and in my view was one of the lowest moments of the house of representatives\nThere's this question I guess that you would have to face and that is if the people want to hear this should we still act in this way or talk this way because it seems like some of the political conversation that goes on today is makes for good entertainment\nAnd people enjoy listening to it and apparently working so there's a bad thing but it's not a good thing or\n[noise] uh\nIs it for example a hoax that the Democrats pulled in having\nFord testify in the United States Congress or is it a hoax to call it a hoax and\nYou get into some very interesting book category of\nWords that are credible but are they credibly used a\nI'm just astonished at the game this has become\nWhen we come back more of ... extended conversation with former Iowa congressman Jim Leach that's next as the Iowa will watch connection in January\nThe I Will watch connection radio programs it's part of a state wide audience engagement project\nOrganized by the Irish Center for public affairs journalism independent\nNonprofit nonpartisan news organization the center is dedicated to producing high quality investigative and community affairs journalism in Iowa last of training journalism students to do this work at a high ethical level in center it's found online at ... dot org", "show_name": "Iowa Watch", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "13"}
