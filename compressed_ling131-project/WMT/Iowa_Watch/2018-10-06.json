{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty ex thousand divided into two hundred thousand right right it would be um six years roughly if you do the pool two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more that's the most I wouldn't want to go\nOh I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that uh but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay because when you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty page sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so uh well go ahead\nAnd get what you ...\nIf we did you think it'd be like the guy to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without our house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment you you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great they do something like day like create your life\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah is with us from Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars in twelve mine good for you and\nYes and I'm Down to just whining dead ... which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now ... ah with very small payment mhm and uh it's been offended collection and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these deaths have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill\nFalling off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband has been a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now and just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it yeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just because they're not reporting\nIt today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with I was just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark what a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad bill\nIt's not a current bill 'cause they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered your payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than a thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand an offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took a a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options mhm\nI'm going to the other options for to take effect\nAnd the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no a neither one way to take another fixed anybody with a nursing care home policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um uh\nSo uh [laughter] the anytime you start waving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call those bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance your homeowner's insurance together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky got your garbage and so ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value or down in value either one no no insurance backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old or\nSomething like a growth in income fonder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else checked smart faster at day Ramsey dot com put in your info it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr frozen\nYour area then they'll have the

M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nHouse Allentown confirmation I'm Pam who sell Fox News hours from now when ethics Supreme Court battle could be over Brett Kavanaugh appears poised to be confirmed this afternoon\nThe suspense lingering over the confirmation vote was dramatically lowered with this announcement from Maine Republican Susan Collins I Will so chicken for jazz Catherine Collins is one of a handful of undecided Republican senators Arizona's Jeff Flake also intends to vote for confirmation\nIf you're a a veteran and you're deployed overseas that shouldn't\nUh precluded from participating not only in the Iowa caucus but in any talk\nOr if you are a person with a disability and you you have a mobility impairment should make sure that any caucus site is acceptable\nOr if you are a shift work or a or you have a family care responsibility should be able to participate and we're working very closely with the party and they have been exceedingly responsive\nOr they were part of that group who ah helped us\nA put together the series of reforms\nAnd and what happens when we're making these process is more inclusive is that more people participate\nAnd that's what we want to do Democrats want to make it easier for folks to vote they want to make it easier for folks to participate you look at what Republicans do across this country they they pass these are horrible voter ID laws to make it harder\nFor folks to participate or their purging voters that ballot boxes uh they're they're doing nothing in the White House in the face\nOf Russian interference was election a these are really important things that I have great confidence that we're going to see a very robust caucus and twenty twenty and\nIt's got to be fired or an inclusive everywhere and that excites me because I think that that's good for Democrats and it's good for democracy\nSo Iowa and New Hampshire have made peace in terms of the changes in Iowa will will not undermine the New Hampshire process I Know that was one of the concerns that folks and New Hampshire had\nI'm confident we can thread that needle very confident\nThat all may be easier said than done given the possible conflict between a long time allies Iowa and New Hampshire but as Dave Nagl told me on October fest he has some ideas\nOne thought that I had to ... we can release raw tools but not until after New Hampshire's oldest process and then try to get to the secretary of New Hampshire to agree that the absentee ballot participation is not the same as or up to\nAnd I and hopefully that'll hopefully that'll thread the needle about half the people who supported Sanders think we ought to go to a primary in June a because that's a that would be fair and Bernie ... one\nAnd a half of them think we shouldn't be first anyway because after all who are we to tell the rest of the country what to do which goes back to the fundamental question why do we start small states and they don't care so we have a division inside her own party\nThe Democrats don't go it alone on this since Nineteen Seventy six Iowa Republicans have held similar but procedure really distinctive caucuses of their own first in the nation on the same night is the Democrats\nThe in state alliance is important as the Republican Party of Iowa chair Jeff Kaufmann told me on September ... ...\nTalk about the relationship between the Republican Party of Iowa and the Iowa Democratic party in working together to ensure that Iowa retains\nIts status and how has what they've\nBeen doing impacted what you're doing absolutely on any given day I could literally have to send out a fairly strong um proactive contrast wheat or that involves Democratic Party and then an hour later talk about how we're\nGoing to join forces to make sure that our first of the nation caucuses run well it's the nature of this job uh you don't take the negatives personally and you have to uh do you have to realize that any given day you may\nGo a attack or get along attack get along back and forth um ultimately\nOn what the ... the Democrats fate and first of the nation and they had a they had a a a higher hill to climb and ask given the fact that there was a little bit more resistance to Iowa and the national Democratic Party and I'll be honest with you you have to see it's it's a lot easier this year with us Donald Trump early on\nTold me that we were going to be first in the nation I mean look in the eye and said that and every step of the way um you know like Donald Trump or not like Donald Trump Donald Trump once again kept his promise on first nations\nSo I I felt confident the entire way through but I gotta tell ya I was in the early in the background rooting that Troy price and the and the national Democrats were going to make sure that we were first nation\nThat's going to happen again now Troy price nice democratic chair and I we have to make sure that our caucuses run smoothly we have the national glare on us he has a bit more challenging situation 'cause he's going to have a lot of candidates in here\nAnd there's gotta be candidates that are going to emerge and get a bump bottom Iowa my my role is going to be making sure that independence realize that there is a you know the the flaws in those Democrats coming through but never never are my words going to\nInterfere with the ability of the Democrats to carry out their caucuses in a fair way that would be irresponsible on my part and for this state so yeah it's it's it's the part of my jobs a month twenty five percent of the job and we must have a strong relationship between the two parties\nAre that Troy is my fourth democratic chair I'm On that I've that I've worked with and honestly every single one of 'em there has been an element of trust I think that the people of Iowa would be really proud\nTo know what's happening behind the scenes because I I Will I Will tell you that the Democratic chair in the Republican chair we may disagree on a whole lot of things but we do not disagree on how important is as for the state\nI'm joined now by ear and Murphy Des Moines bureau chief for Lee Enterprises from your perspective covering the carcasses and the capital city what might some of these changes due to the process and how Democrats in particular approach it as individuals are running for president\nYeah that that will be interesting I don't know that\nIt'll change a whole lot as far as I'm thinking specifically the people who show up to caucus and and now they decide which can that they're going to support and and and all those sorts of things I don't know that it'll have a huge influence on that um you know this is such a um\nA an oath to trust that you're literally standing in the room in front of everybody else declaring who you're supporting um I I don't see any reason that that would change um that these changes would affect how people approach that that the one big thing that does change is\nA it specially depending on how the absentee process works is now that enters into someone's equation I don't ask to be there are at seven o'clock this Tuesday night in the middle or in early February in the middle of winter\nUm if if I Want to just send in an absentee ballot I I have that option now um that I Will I assume we'll we'll definitely factor or into a caucus goers a calculus I'm so that could be interesting to see\n'em you know cock is not much that impacts caucus night turnout and and and overall numbers to get more people overall but few are actually at the caucuses on caucus night that that\nWould be interesting to watch\nThere is a sense though that if you do broaden it beyond that night in other words like opening up more of the absentee process it may change how candidates approach things but I'm not sure it will change at markedly what do you think\nYeah I think that's fair to say I mean again the the absentee thing being that the biggest um um factor there it'll be interesting to see how much candidates pushed that um that this is unique to up to a ... situation we know in normal elections primaries than in general elections that\nCampaigns um make pushing early voting huge deal so now that that's an option in the ... will will they will they push that here in the ... or ... Democrats\nSee something like that as a as as unseemly towards the clock is like ... will will they push back it someone saying hey don't bother going to the caucuses you can vote absentee and you're secure I Would not like that but that that's going to be fascinating for me to watch to\nCarcasses have multiple purposes one of which of course is to begin the delegate selection process that's the primary function of why they're held but it is also a party building operation the idea to work one on one with individuals develop a deeper base\nAre these changes in your mind going to enhance their party building or potentially have a negative effect on it especially with the possibility of absentee\nYeah yeah I could see that go on either way you know you would think at the base of it in an absentee vote may the option to voter apathy get more\nPeople involved in the process and and and as such get more people involved in it within the party which would be good for the party\nBut you know that's still not getting someone in the room that night you're engaged but you're not in the room so is is that the Democrats still think that's a good thing or or or is it fair that that kind of create\nAn option to create some disconnected that that doesn't um uh you know keep someone as involved as the otherwise would be by showing up so so that's a that's absolutely an interesting question see what kind of impact um that after the option as a on the already building aspect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Iowa Watch", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "06"}
