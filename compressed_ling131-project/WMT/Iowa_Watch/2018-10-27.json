Seventy thousand most of the student loans\nOkay so Seventy plus about fifty yeah\nAbout fifty four actually okay\nRight um well the rule of thumb I use is this you don't want to own vehicles that are more than half your annual income and if you discover through going through financial peace and you'd make the phone call like you're making is can we be debt free but the house in two years if we keep the cars\nAnd your answer is no\n... I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so\nIf you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where'd you get your values are those private sales values are wholesaler a dealer offer what\nAre those are trade and values\nOkay so you could actually sell them for more than that possibly yes how's your credit\nOh no you definitely could you ... you saw it for more than ... ... value I mean you saw it for ... on on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nUm have you all this money to these these two car loans where the loans I Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit for all right\nSo you've not got an easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all and her name\nThen yes uh-huh okay\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nSo if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty\n... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the er the deal and the Eighteen probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows on white man and the whole if those are trading values I'm not a ... year only about\nSix and the whole here um that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had of value of a hundred thousand dollars\nOkay and when you're the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd buying our by you try to sell it for ... I'm going to guess and say let's say for instance it would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless spot three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay and um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrowed the difference\nFrom the credit union in your wife's name\nWas her credit ... and I get your three thousand or a car and I hope the\nBut she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with student loans but you're making one twenty six so you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up and car once we're out of debt and have your emergency unemployment\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years I'm\nOkay and that gets you clear but you know your car poor you have a car mess on your hands you're right to observe that\nAnd um\nYou know at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trading with the dealer though you're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run ... Carmichael profit they don't they're not in the break even business there and the\nProfit business and so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion easy if not more\nThe difference in trade in value in private sale on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here in the ... and buy it currently on I've got a Jew by I thought that after you and then the money maker\nFinancial piece book and the total panic over book okay\n[laughter] and I am Seventy thousand dollars in ... and I and cutting their teeth out right now and I felt I work and they create a I have great now working Seventy hours a week I'm thirty and then I think it's fair to say yes\nI'm right now there are kind of at the minimum payments but I Do not have a thousand dollar phased out\nMy main cry it aired I had like go out for mark and I should have about a hundred hours racked over now not getting any money or anything like it back and forth\nBut how much I point out in ... and ... ... ... ... ... category\nI Know now it's time to read the books that you bought\nThe book the book the total money make over will explain to you exactly how to take your baby steps\nAnd I'm the first thing we're going to get current with everyone and get on a written budget you don't have a detailed budget yet you just got ... got a little list that you made but you don't even got car gas on your list yet so you don't have an adult budget yet you need to do that on an easy way to do that is go to every\nDollar dot com and download the app for your iPhone or your eye pad or her I'm sure your iPhone or your Android or you can put it on your desktop and it's free to use every dollar\nAnd every dollar will help you put together your budget in about ten minutes so the first thing is to get a detailed written budget that you do a new one every single month\nThe second thing you've got to do as a part of doing that budget you have to have your husband involved you have to be in agreement if you're not an agreement and both of you pulling this wagon together you're going to get really tired of pulling the wagon by yourself\nYou have to have unity you have to have agreement in order to win with money it's almost impossible to do it with one spouse by themselves\nSo a budget that your spouse and you both have looked at and you both agree to on every dollar dot com now when you've got that and your current with your bills the first goal\nIs to save a thousand dollars ... just save a thousand dollars for all the money you can squeeze out of your budget into that baby step on until you get a thousand dollars then maybe step to you'll read all of this when you read the total money make over me\nIs you start lifting your debt smallest largest and you attack\nThem in that order and that was this hour that Iran's are showing the bugs will be back in the meantime remember ultimately only one way to financial piece of ... daily ... which is Jesus and\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorse agents who care more about helping their clients than earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a Yale be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E.

downtown Miami federal detention center say Iraq has a long criminal history and a radical history of extreme political views\nWill some first time I Will voters I well informed about the twenty Eighteen gubernatorial race between Republican incumbent Kim Reynolds Democrat Fred Hubble and libertarian Jake Porter\nIt was getting ready to vote for the first time are still doing research some Eighteen and Nineteen year old Iowans are not even sure whether they plan to vote at all I Will watch talked to a first time voters about whether the gubernatorial campaigns are appealing to them as well as what kind of information they're looking for and what issues they think are most important\nLauren restrict sample does not know yet whether she's going to vote nor who she will vote for she chooses to cast a ballot she's Eighteen and her Monticello\nAnd I really thought about it a whole lot no [noise]\nI don't know yet but I sure\nMany of the people we talked to said they care about candidates stances on social issues in the states such as abortion immigration and transgender rights amber Jensen is Twenty years old and a first time voter from Davenport\nAs a Spanish major at Cornell College who said she hopes to work with the Latino community in Iowa as a career she said the immigration debate is important to her as well including how it related to the immigration status of the man accused of murdering Milly tidbits\n... said that despite the fact that tip it's family did not want to politicize her death Reynolds made a political will help with the not when asked about whether the candidates were talking about the issues drifts and cares about she said\nI Believe that they are\nI follow Fred held onto it or my friend is actually\nWorking for his campaign [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I look at can Reynolds treats but I don't personally all her on Twitter I Do keep up with\nThe things that she's doing within the state um\nNews stations\nEmily boots off is

race but did not know or whom when we talked with her we spoke at the Iowa memorial union where it was busy uh students lined up for early satellite voting that was taking place\nI'm Wondering because they can be trained\nYeah [noise] um do you have any like examples of that yeah um [noise] I\nBut I Do [laughter]\nWho tough also said that she thinks partisan activity has turned the political process more commercial McGuire ... who was Nineteen years old and originally from Des Moines agrees he said he thinks politicians often cater to their political parties too much and that you will probably choose to vote for the candidate whose ideas or their own rather than those of their party\nPartisanship is not the only frustration some first time voters have with the gubernatorial election and the political process and general Tyler Dennis is a Nineteen year old from Cedar Rapids and said he finds that different media bias these impact the political process and determine who people vote for\n[noise] do you think like the the media has been doing an okay job looks sort of covering the two candidates from your point of view and I think\nFor me it is very late and\nSome media sources are more and more conservative and you see the different from our\nThey're on their mouths they portray the different candidates like how often they do and\nSchultz said he talked to his dad about voting and his dad told and then it's pretty easy however he said that while he's excited to vote for the first time he's also nervous the reason he had not yet cast his vote when we spoke with his lack of knowledge on the different candidates the hard part is informing yourself I think knowing what's going on he said that's what's been holding me back\nI don't want to go up there and vote and then not really know what I'm voting on\nI ... for the I Will watch connection\nThe ethics and politics initiative is a special reporting to you within the daily only what located at the University of all I Want you know it will city the team does in the political reporting\nIowa ... executive director editor law Muller serves as the team's reporting coach and he spoke with two members of the team Eli on a ... ... ... ... will be the first student voice you hear\nYou've been talking with young voters give us some idea how many you've been talking to and what they're telling you is forest this election\n[noise] I've been talking with a variety of young voters vote who are involved in getting other young voters registered developed but then also voters who are at these registration tables they've been popping up around campus leading up to them in terms\nAnd a lot of what I've heard is talking about issues versus candidates names um and also where they're going to be voting I've heard a lot through claimed by absentee I'm from where they're from because they thought their vote has more weight\nAt those locations and in those districts versus here in Johnson county the Tennessee more blue overall\nAre they all from Iowa or are they from other states as well\nI've talked to a lot more from Iowa and African voting by absentee versus going home to their actual I'm Tom towns\nSeries your talking with voters we're talking with reporters we're talking with voters are you getting a sense of whether or not the first time voters are likely what they're hearing for candidates are they are there needs to be fulfilled by the candidates\nI think it depends on what their views are I think that abortion is a very key issue for a lot of voters and I think that um but at least in the governor's race\nOf voters are hearing what they want to hear from either side whether they support Kim Reynolds is pro life agenda or whether they support what Dr Hubble is saying with restraint funding to Planned Parenthood\nAre you talking about these young voters hearing what they want to hear because they're predisposed to agree with that or are you talking about young voters who say they're hearing what they want to hear because those are the questions to answer\nThat is a good question and I'm not sure that that is a aunts that is a question that I can answer\nThat that they're aware of or that if they're aware that they're\nAsking us questions or I think it's mostly that they're hearing there is those positions from ads and from from campaign rallies and maybe not seeking out are asking questions of candidates\nDo either of you sense excitement among the first time voters in Iowa about this election\nI think there's more of a passive next to it I don't think that I've been seeing as much if people actually getting engaged um about who the actual candidates are that are running I think they're aware of what issues there may be passionate about like affordable health care\nOr like ... that I'm pro choice versus pro life but I haven't actually done relating those issues to who they're going to vote for him because they stand for those values and so I think there's been kind of a lack of push of education from what I've been talking to voters\nAnd so I really question like if you're not getting educated or are you really going to then turned out to vote if you don't know who was even on the ballot\nAnd I think one of the things is that we don't have a huge personality like we did in the presidential race everybody knew the names of the candidates and the presidential race um this in twenty sixteen maybe more so than the twenty Eighteen election there's just no like huge\nPersonality that everybody already knew beforehand um but I think that there's this push on social media especially kind of harnessing the mean culture to try and get people registered to vote and to try and get people to then vote but I guess we'll see if that if that works if that's motivating\nBy will will be elected governor for four year term do censor any kind of improved in that race especially among college students with whom you speak because of how much impacts the government has on three public universities in Iowa\nI've heard a lot about being against the cuts that can run Olson has made recently to the three universities um in terms of cutting back\nOn how much is funding for them and that has really like about a talking point for I think a lot of people trying to engage young voters an awfully young voters and that they don't want their tuition to continue to rise and they definitely have a link turn him I feel it's more to the cuts men you know talking about how the legislator regions were involved in\nWhich was going to be my question because the legislature was involved with this as well to be talking about the legislators\nI haven't heard that it's usually the other day the names of can run on and on the occasion front ... but again it goes back to I think there's a lack of education right now\nOne of these candidates have to do to appeal to young voters\nI think to stand there at the issue of education\nFunding education as\nFamous is going to be our priority even if there are going to be budget cuts if we see the or if there are going to be budget shortfalls again we'll prioritize education funding and we were on prioritize funding for health care options I think is what voters want to hear that part of it is meeting them where they are to\nFeel like they've been around for the college town but actually having rallies I is college campuses 'em or you know I\nYou know there's more places that are accessible to them I don't feel like I've seen that as much I don't think people are always motivated like to hear like oh\nReynolds or how we're speaking in Cedar Rapids and I'm here in Iowa City or I'm up in ... I'm going to drive down to go see them as part of it is just making their face now on on these locations where there's a high percentage in population of these young voters\nLA on a ... and Sarah wants in of the ethics and politics initiative ... is a special reporting team within the daily audio when at the University of Iowa they spoke with their reporting coach wild Muller who is also the executive director and editor of Iowa watch", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Iowa Watch", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "27"}
