{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "... yeah and just lean you've got to have that guideline everybody does single or married that those boundaries those guard rails and that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you want to get your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year\nAnd so you know it's like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car\nOkay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now because you want it because you want the car and you want it paid off true\nYeah I mean the show it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think\nYou can pay it off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fund up three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over at a walk you right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our real\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself better than I deserve what's up\nHaving a quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being get free within six months and the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now we'll beyond step three\nUm and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings fun but yet we sell the house for a pretty good profit\nCareer or some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency farm in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or\nOh you want us to go about doing that\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in there and we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before we want to move but we do need to ...\n... um well you can do what you want to do I mean you're growing up you're allowed to there's no law on any of this but um yes um what what I Do\nI think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you have an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom okay I think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place I quit having emergencies that was the weirdest thing but as long as I was broke my live looked like a country song\nAnd not that I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think her bond buying her car's non emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for an emergency fun now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the three mark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut we're comfortable with the three months of expenses emergency funds at least until we get her car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not she's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency fund for it mark is in Orlando, Florida Hi Mark how are you\nDoing here near better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my ... been together for about three years or very young\nAnd we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married good move in together good ah we don't know over financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ... how old are you Twenty one\nOkay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year mhm and what your career ah right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan\nI yeah sure I ... I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't your career plan\nOh a great place are now offering pretend like some young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in a warehouse or Twenty one just walked into your house and wanted to marry your daughter\nYeah what would you tell him I'd want to know what his dad gummed plan is right Yes sir how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of her like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right he'd be saying OK guys a sharp young do\nThey not making anything right now and you work in a warehouse but way but he's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she's in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school chatted about another year and a half years okay and what were her degree being ah she's teaching\nOkay and who's paying for her school\nRight now her and her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she can complete and be a teacher while you're married\nTo ask but hopefully I I think it would go over there\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time in coming years already five thousand on her income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going more than double it'd be making over Seventy a cup closed eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money and then you've got better prospects 'cause you're going to start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one is for taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one ... that makes sense okay there\nSo I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are today\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat do you want to do where you go because let me tell you if you aim at nothing you hit it every time you'll be thirty one year old warehouse worker\nAnd you don't want to hear that there's nothing wrong with no shame and being a warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right yeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking where\nOK okay you know that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of talk through and so forth and then you got a game plan C I my goal was I was going to be rich and real estate when I was your age is what I wanted to I was dating my wife I was Twenty one I was so broke I couldn't pay attention I had a daughter sixteen and my checking account\nI'm driving all all in our second date in a Monte Carlo that had two hundred and fifty thousand miles a third engine and the second transmission had been hit on every side this car was a piece of crafts\nFor driving along on her second date and I'm telling her how I'm going to be a millionaire and real estate one day and as we as I said that we went across the railroad tracks buffer fell off my car\n[noise] so where I was right then was not indicative of where I was going says if anybody look at where I was right there there was no evidence to say I was going to be anybody and but you got to be a minute or something man that's what you got to be doing this was a diver empty show [noise]\n[noise] ...\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six

dollar dreams there live this morning I'm Pam who sounds lottery machines crank out the tickets [noise]\nNight now one of them matched all six numbers in last night's mega millions during that means the jackpot on Tuesday swells to one point six billion dollar is he died in a fistfight\nWhere but that's really not the driver is not that we showed disagree about abortion or so to speak about gun control to the most contentious issues in my opinion\nIs that there's something about the winning and losing\nOf uh uh\nOf the separated groups in terms of how it's being presented everything now is is like it's a win for the Democrats or Republicans I'm and everybody wants to win nobody's saying it's a win for the United states yes the only thing is when the United states\nThat second voice you heard at the end belongs to mark Dwyer a semi retired business woman from Fairfield who has served as associate vice president of business development at Cambridge investment research she's a Democrat\nHaving run unsuccessfully for county supervisor in twenty sixteen she served on the non partisan Fairfield school board for ten years she meant to Reno and Shipley are trying the better angels approach along with others and hope what they are doing catches on\nWe'll have more about better angels later in this report before that though we want you to hear how these political opposites talk about their disagreements\nThe catalyst for this particular discussion is a question we ask about driving by a sign Easter Fairfield but says Hillary Clinton for prison\nWhile listening to the latest accusation on the radio that Donald Trump is racist Shipley zero in on media coverage of politics\nI'm desperate for news and opinions but I just that's why Trump appeals to me because of I don't trust the media and I think they've been doing a poor job I think a lot of this uh incendiary headline reporting again filled with half truths or or delivered distortions are\nOr whatever it is is really ... the biggest thing preventing us that every time we were turned on the TV you're going to be outraged about something and how the media seemed at least in his last Eighteen months has that one thing after another about whipping people into a frenzy and getting upset about\nDwyer has pushed back laying blame on political leadership but doesn't attack\nOur leaders aren't they're not pushing in that direction I leaders are capitalizing on the polarization in my view a and they're trying to be very careful to stay identified with their base\nAnd rather than to help they or or to um\nDetoxify situation so that we can consider ideas from both sides I I feel like that's a concern that I Am leadership I mean\nI I agree with what you said about some of what you suggest about the media but I also I president has been tweeting things that are half troops and incendiary and you know some I again my ... my view is I don't know that our leaders are going there on their own\nJoe man to Reno enters the conversation\nAnd I think the media has understandably but they cover the political situation as the way they cover a sporting event yeah who's winning who's losing\nIf we vote on something is really complicated that has lots of lessons and lots of minuses but if it has a a smidgen more close to the Democrats is the kind of a win for the Democrats and Republicans feel bad because they're identified with the ... the razor and yeah the losers you know when I moved\nBut that division exist regardless of whether he was in Trump country Clinton country or replace split politically like Fairfield Jefferson County\nI Will watch reporter Matthew McDermott ran into several people who just wanted to avoid the conversation some laughed off the question and good natured style in a kind of you know the answer manner\nSome said they just don't care about politics up you were testy about the question and yet others were willing to talk\nFor a long time\nBut not be identified that discussion is needed however the better angels with whom we spoke said\nAnd I find that if we can do that and we get out of the ideal on level we can actually find a lot of common ground and possibly solve problems but when we're sucking I'm blue and your red and I'm not giving anything up we're never going to get information is that in the classroom\nAnd on and we'll watch as Lyle Muller talked with Matthew midterm it who has an Iowa will watch summer twenty Eighteen reporting in turn\nTalked with more than fifty people in three diversify what counties with one overall question in mind can you have a civil conversation about controversial political issues with people who have opposing views\nWalk us through how that went as you were going up to people to try to ask that question\nYeah so the first time I tried going straight up to people was in a field which is the ... of Jefferson County\nUm I Would say that went fairly well and had great conversations on the Fairfield overall is pretty good\nAfter that I went to vent your county and then you're in county was a significantly higher than a Jefferson\nOr nobody and then you're in really wanted to talk to me or at least the ones who went up to the ones I went up to did not want to talk to me there is one instance where I talked to two men\nAnd even though I had quite a long recession and then they didn't want to be recorded\nAnd they didn't get any any\nOf their personal information such as their name age where they live\nAnd again we needed that for identifying if if the interesting thing I think about what you did and you also went to Johns accounting and talk to people three county\nBut what I think is interesting is that here was this question can you have a civil conversation about controversial issues in politics and I ran into people who\nWon didn't even want to talk about it yeah two people who did but you ran into some people who actually illustrated whether you're going to have a civil conversation yeah without\nDirectly answering the question yeah woke up some of those instances so there are a lot of the\nRepublican chairwoman of Jefferson County I was originally and trying to meet with her and then some of her fellow Republicans\nAnd she\nNot want to do that in any way she said that she was not going to reach out to any of the Republican she knew and even though she didn't want to meet with me and she told me over the phone that there is no way that they would be able to have a civil conversation over the topics such as abortion\nAnd then women stripped productive riots so even though I didn't end up meeting with her she gave me a quote from the story and she really kind of laid out\nWhat how some people feel about you know ... such as abortion which was really helpful Matthew ... who wouldn't want to talk about American politics\n[noise] yeah I mean I think a lot of conservatives really trust the media unfortunately it did say that the media is left leaning\nIn a way it it seems to be very over the political sphere of things in this country a lot of people expressed discuss they don't trust\nThe politicians at the state or national level and they just kind of had enough so I think a lot of people when you come up and say hey I Want to tie you about whether you have is silicon recession about politics they automatically I I don't want to talk about that\nI Will watch some are twenty Eighteen intern Matthew McDermott with Iowa will watch executive director and editor law will Muller coming up we'll tell you about one counties attempt
