{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Again around here I don't know if that would be that extreme it was pretty extreme you know as as California and Nevada Arizona that kind of thing but that'd be the only thing I Would add into it\nWell we thank you so much for the question Joel and if you'd like to submit your own question go the premier advisors L. L. C. dot com that's premiering advisors L. C. dot com I give a call gets on the counter jolt talk more indefinitely or anyone else who's got a similar question or just questions period they'd like to have a conversation about eight\nFour four four to four planets a number to call eight four four four to four plan\nWe've got another email question I'm gonna try to get to that too but I really wanted to ask you guys about this uh this in the news topic that I that I've seen a lot of times he tried to do this has its own little segment but I really wanted to toss this out there because it kind of hit me as interesting as we are going through our conversation today and I'm watching the different\nNews feeds that are coming up and things that we're talking about I Try to grab an interesting headline and this one was certainly interesting so I wanted to get your guys take on this\nAs marijuana has become more legalize and more and more states fellows\nWere starting to see the stock prices of this a product go up pot producer's they're creeping up if you will are you guys ready to embrace this as a legitimate investment opportunity do you see it something more like bitcoin is it's still too early to tell what's your thoughts\nMaybe it would be the best way I could answer that OK so a legitimate investment opportunity is\nKind of the key three words I Would pick out of your question I guess okay 'cause legitimacy of that investment is based upon state regulatory laws federal laws and there's really not at least in this country not yelling right\nViewpoint but if you take the example of somewhere like Canada where they've decided to move towards making marijuana legal in the entire country that's where there are some potential investment opportunities now keep in mind you also um made a correlation to bitcoin which\nKind of has developed its own bubble and burst ah mentality and that could very well be what we're seeing with marijuana stocks and those types of things\nYou want to be careful because there are legitimate investments to trade on the stock exchanges that gets you into this industry there are also some trade over the counter markets which was a little bit more of a gray area in terms of\nWhere stocks are treated as an investment and you know I've I've run into this many times with gold diamond mining rare earth minerals people go out and say well I can buy the stock it you know point zero zero zero three cents a share and I can\nTake a very small amount of money and a half a million shares of it when it turns into just a dollar share I'll be a millionaire and\nYou know frankly a lot of those things don't work out do you want to make sure that if you're going to get into a industry such as this you want to make sure you're educated on the risks or at least that you're using an advisor who's done research in educated on the risks and I've done\nA lot of research on this area just simply because I've had clients coming to me asking about it and I like to research things so it's kind of one of the things I have a passion for the one thing I Would say is that\nThere is a definite shift in investing in this industry\nI'm seeing a lot of major beverage makers starting to look at this in two different ways\nSome are investing in the marijuana industry so that they can essentially like in Canada create a version of an alcoholic beverage but instead of using alcohol using the THC properties of\nMarijuana as part of that to make a beverage I'm also starting to see some companies and track to read articles recently of Coca Cola looking into some companies to use it not for the THC properties actually to take that out\nYou know they still want to keep their brand is kind of a family oriented brand I guess right but there are some anti inflammatory properties that they've been exploring and maybe using it as a part of the recovery drink\nYou know that type of thing so if you if you look a little bit past the excitement look a little bit more into the science to do some digging find companies that have legitimate\nSets and profitability and are just taking on a whole lot of debt that's kinda how I look at it you know it's a kind of in the dot com bubble type thing with with marijuana starts you just have to be careful there are some good things that came out of that dot com but uh you know not everything was bad but there sure was a whole pile of things that could\nGo up yeah yeah and then a lot of things that blew up yeah that was kind of my\nQuestion I just kinda was wondering if it was still being looked at upon is as kind of a fad type of deal or you know like a bubbly type of deal and and I know people tend to you know we tend to go\nIn extreme sometimes in this country right now the bitcoin thing not even just in this country I guess all around so I was curious about that all although I gotta say when you were mentioning other companies looking is something I was like I could just like a mutual fund would it be cookies and chip manufacturers trying to link up\nWith it [laughter] I don't have the money she said ... telling you know a little fun but you know\nIn an attempt to a re energized and revitalize the inner city area but it also meant a lot of things that had been familiar for a long long time we are disappearing very quickly at the same time uh plans are being put in place to clear a path for interstate coming through town\nSo that was also going to very much physically change of the city or there are plans to remove a lot of buildings along the river front to create river from parks\nAnd all of this physical change meant that speed wraps is going to be looking very very different for the first time a several decades and so uh there was a lot of interest in trying to come up with a new way to sell the city to newcomers to people who may not have been the Cedar Rapids for a long time for tourists\nAnd coming up with a slogan that would\nReally represent a [noise] what life is he drops his power and the and the real amenities as sheet wrap it had to offer because as part of these plans to clear out a lot of lot of old things build new things a part of that was building new and many of these for the city to make it even\nA more enjoyable place to live work and play so the idea of the five seasons was that um cigarettes has so many wonderful a recreational\nAnd cultural amenities a even fifty years ago of course I mean we didn't have\nThat you know cultural many of these we think of today like a a you know Bruce was not really a national historic site yet it was still a private home\nOf fifty years ago Margaret Howard hall were still living there but we didn't have the art center you know the forerunner of this rapid museum of art before runner name and we had um you know we we we had the uh the symphony and we had the theaters downtown and\nWe had the vast park system and so Cedar Rapids were already had a reputation of being a great quality of life community and that quality of life concept was what came into play\nFor the concept of the fire season um initially uh they came up with sort of this idea that there were five components to the quality of life of living in Cedar Rapids so there was like a working growing enjoying\nA Kennedy these five categories and the chamber of commerce of course I'm a was the the the leader of the movement to create a new um\nFive seasons a logo and they want to know kind of a simple to do with it and they were preparing a new chamber of commerce book for Cedar Rapids for the year Nineteen Seventy\nAnd it was going to be kind of a a colorful booklet of photographs of what's he'd wrap look like as a way to sell the city to the rest of the world and to the locals to say you're close Cedar Rapids as like going into the Nineteen seventies and that book feature kind of I'm\nA a symbol of the first attempt at the logo of the city applied seasons with these five teams and it looks very similar to the NBC a peacock local kind of these five feather like um you know circles circular\nSections that detailed these five components of what life was like in Cedar Rapids and that early concept of five seasons or five component of living in Cedar Rapids\nDingell very well and the chamber of commerce just two years later\nCame up a sort of the kinds of of yet another book which is published in Nineteen Seventy three and by that time they kind of changed the idea of the city if I see is a little bit to simplify it a little bit\nAnd have sort of the uh the for regular seasons in the fifth season was kind of emphasized as the fifth season has time to enjoy time to enjoy the quality of life\nIn the Cedar Rapids area uh that we have 'em all the components to make sure that when you're not working and are just wonderful places to uh enjoyed a recreational facilities or the community and entertainment and the culture and so forth\nAnd there was actually taken from a religious passage of you know time is so precious and\nHaving the time to enjoy and having to think\nThat you enjoy your quality of life it really kind of was a concept of the quality of life so people can understand the four seasons but that curious to see us in the fifties and the time to enjoy the quality of life with in the other four seasons so that was really kind of the idea of it and it was really kind of a you know at at the time and Nineteen Seventy\nOne to her so much change going on there was kind of resurgence of a you know people are enjoying where recreation time today it ever had before you know the forty hour week I've been established for quite a while to work weekends so that was really kind of the idea of the city five seasons\nAnd ah then later on that kind of modify the logo didn't so much looked like the NBC peacock but evolves by the late Nineteen seventies into the image that we see today which has kind of a a\nCircular kind of half circular ... uh features what kind of the longest one coming out the bottom the original color of\nIt was orange or the logo of the city if I see as well as the orange for the city and then they really built up the premise as they developed a civic center\nThe intention was to call that the five teeth\nTo really promote the logo the city adopted the logo for all of its vehicles for all the letterhead a so this combination effort of the chamber of commerce a which is now known as the economic the lions and the city government to kind of create these um [noise] a method of really um\nAdvertising the idea that seed rapid as the city of seasons now in more recent years we've changed the color of the logo to city of privacy than\nFrom orange too dark green kind of a forest or natural green and so now she kinda that green color but many mia forgot that it was originally orange\nAnd one interesting a side effect of the original orange color every time you saw the original logo in the late Nineteen seventies or the study finds either one of the orange that many people still remember out there uh when the seasons center opened and for many of its early years all the seats in the arena we're orange\nThen we're orange seats in the fight scenes that are now known as the U.S tell your son\nAnd then of course all this led to the creation of the tree of five seasons are just over Twenty years ago to kind of this cultural a form of this logo that was developed in the Nineteen seventies\nWe also in the past I'm Mark can we just have a couple of minutes and it's like but but what about some other city slogans real briefly when they were used to and uh I Know was one officially cereal city I Know that probably came out of a Quaker Oats and have a ... I think national\nTook the time I think it's wrong foods currently but uh we were known for a serial because a General Mills also on board is part of the industrial base for the city of sitting around it's a part of the city I Know is one so they just give us a brief timeline them when those were actually in fact\nA a funeral child chapel facility full service uh services for the public to the Turner family\nA grant ward was hired to redecorate the interior the old house uh to help design the interior of the addition and then for the next eighty years from Nineteen twenty four through two thousand for\nA this was primarily used as a funeral home and I'm a runner other amazing things that happened in the house or the turners had it uh they developed the term I call company out of there and then towards late Nineteen Seventy ... family in Cedar Rapids lava so she was a war all here in the community\nUh they took over operations of the Turner funeral home at eight hundred Second Avenue and\nUntil just before five years ago they were there were still involved with the property and now we've converted it to the opportunity came along for the history center to acquire at four years ago the other twenty fourteen and uh we had a great a campaign to raise the funds to renovate and restore it we've really done a great job we believe\nStory into building a converting it for use as a museum uh we we we change some things about it but we haven't changed anything about the wonderful history associated with it and we just think it's just a perfect location for a\nA we have space

the Halloween a day on October thirty first but uh what what can you really expect when you go to a hunted alley in Cedar Rapids\nWell the thing is is that the alleys jak alleys are generally kinda spooky anyway so where does this is not like a haunted house tour or something like that you know we we kind of thrown a term haunted because you know there are the ghost of the history of the past
