advisors 'cause it it's a hand in hand with what's going on at such an emotional experience this is where really having a solid rock\nOf somebody that can help you navigate\nThe financial side because really you know death of the spouse you're not thinking of finances typically or if you are it's just adding onto the stress you know the things that can occur with that or income you know how's income going to get replaced even if you're already retired\nYou know it's to Social Security checks becoming one depending on what pension options if there is a pension\nIf there was not survive ability option that was selected that can also cut down in income quite a bit\nMaybe if you're if you're younger and this happens you know you look at some what seemingly if some insurmountable debt you know maybe a mortgage on the houses now all on you or\nIf there's any student loans your credit cards you know depending on if you have it with all the way your debt you know these are some big things some really really big things it's losing Muslim people say you're better half but it's it's losing half or your support structure\nYou know if you're young and you've got kids and you're in the workforce and your spouse is not will now who's going to take care of the kids are or vice versa if you're home with the kids and you know who's going to provide the the income flow you know what's going to happen right it's\nSuch a huge devastating thing that really people should ask themselves you know if you if you're listening and you're married and your spouse passed away today what would you do\nAnd if you say I don't I don't know\nHaven't really thought about it I don't like to think about it\nI agree with you it's a terrible fought to think of\nBut it is something that you have to be prepared for unfortunately things can come out of the blue and we're not trying scarier we're just trying to prepare you\nAnd uh you know you really want to think about what protections you have in place and do you ever will if something happened to both of you you know who's to take your kids if you've got kids you know who's gonna who's going to do that and and most importantly if\nEven if you have a willing place to say here's who is going to take care of the kids\nWell how are they gonna financially support your kids you know you may be growing and large family you know if you've got friends or neighbors your family who is going to take care of your kids will you're not put in a financial burden on them so what are you going to do to prepare\nFor that and hopefully it never happens hopefully you know you live a very long time and you're you're right off into the sunset together at a ripe old age but just in case that doesn't happen you really really need to be prepared doesn't even necessarily in a full financial plan from us you might just have some questions on\nOn getting prepared for an event like that and what you can do that would be a reason to give us a call\nI've had a quite a bit of experience unfortunately what this where where we've gone through the passing of a spouse some that were quick that were very unexpected some that were more longer term illness issues ah where we had some preparedness but ah one for\nJust an example that I went through and this was about four or five years ago\nShe didn't none of the finances for the county took care of all the investments when they came in she was kind of quiet he did everything he went in for a ... exam and ended up having a heart attack on the table while I was going on and\nShe lived out of town she actually lived up or in a Waterloo area and he had quite a bit of assets that were extensive spread out in a lot of different areas or even had some stock certificates and the safe that she didn't know about\nI went up and sat down with her for um it took about two hours each point and then about four points altogether\nTo make sure that we're getting everything switched around a name change is making sure that her income streams from a GI corrupt account would continue on the way it was before he passed away and even changing over the electric bills and and some of the bank accounts from joined accounts into her individual name\nThat is what we try to do for our clients when you're going through a process like that because it is a very emotional time in the last thing that you want to have to worry about is how to change your name on a bank account when he just lost the love of your life to something that was sudden or even long term\nSo that's what we're therefore that's why we help that's why we like to put these analysis together that's why why we like to develop a relationship\nWith you as a client so that when something unexpected and unfortunately like this does happen we can be there for you and we can help you through that process since then she's moved um further south and I am\nAnd the year I still get down and and get a visitor and she's doing really well so\nYou know this is the time if you guys\nAnybody out there that has not worked with an advisor in the past or is concerned about some of the topics that we talked about\nPlease give us a

painful process it's pretty easy to get going all you got to say we do is get on the counter by calling\n... for for for to for a plan that is eight four four four to four plan once you make that initial call a lot of people\nWant him saying that's just the hardest part as women to pick up the phone and get started\nThe team will take over from there and help you out in any way they can and it's pretty simple to do as Tony mentioned earlier in the program they've got some good information they'll send out to you to help kind of pull things together and get started and you'll find it a fairly enjoyable process I think all the way around eight for for\nFor two for playing guys thanks so much for your time today Tony and Jason I always appreciate you hear appreciate you riding along with me and sharing your wisdom\nAbsolutely markets pleasure and um we'd also like to think of listeners out there for tuning in I Know I've talked to a lot of them over the last several months and you know we've got 'em all over Iowa tune in and do some people listen on their way and\nOn Sundays to church some people are just getting up in the morning and getting things going and we just want to thank everybody for listening and hope you know you're not going to knowledge that uh when we have to offer\nActually built for another purpose in this case of a beautiful bank um the former guaranteed bank building um was originally built for the Cedar Rapids savings bank the uh the corner sexual it's a beautiful five story tower\nWas initially put up an Eighteen Ninety six and then in Nineteen oh nine they built a rather large mostly six story addition to the east of it and it really has been a landmark in downtown Cedar Rapids but it's always been to use a as a bank is lower levels\nAnd officers on the upper levels it's ever been used for housing 'em and the prospect of it possibly becoming a whole health facility is really quite intriguing\nUm that really is really has a ... very much in Cedar Rapids ... there have been some occasional smaller buildings that have been converted to some sort of housing in the past in fact another building on the same block with most of us knows the old dragging Chinese restaurant building\nActually started out as an office building then later on I was converted into houses before apartments not for hotel rooms so I'm certainly the guarantee bankrolling has a really amazing presence in downtown Cedar Rapids a key structure in the downtown historic district took on the national editors are places it's got a great power and a quarter\nAnd I can really see the appeal of 'em\nThat potentially being I'm a hotel room property right there and it would be at the same manner second third avenue in third street where many of us remember for a long time or to the corner from there and one of the other corners of third avenue\nThey're free to Montrose hotel for many many years um and so this would be just like right across the intersection from that um that this plan goes forward\nAnd uh also exciting is the prospect of a perhaps a incorporating the former um world movie theater which before that was known as the state theater and even before that the the first round theater in Cedar Rapids\nUm the fact that that could be incorporated um you know there's a lot of details yet to come but this could be a really big thing uh for a section of downtown Cedar Rapids that has a lot of history to it\nAnd um I Love this idea of incorporating a exciting proud to collect is that the existing to start going to guarantee bank building in the world theater\nUm perhaps putting them something new right next to it or whether it's currently under a new area of the parking lot and um that down the road um I don't I don't believe that the former dragging Chinese restaurant building is included as part of this project at this point but a lot to see what happens is that there are so\nVery recently announced it sounds kind of exciting I mean I think it's a nice time and again like we've seen the other recent downtown project where um I think there are always more successful when you combine a renovation of older historic building things combined those with new construction I think that's a really great way to\nPreserve the are the best of the past and then also has some really nice new amenities to keep the downtown area development going forward I think that that that tell me like a really intriguing idea happening pretty soon on her\nAnd really the impact that it's so close to the train tracks not that there's passenger rail service at that particular point but it doesn't seem to be a detriment to the hotel\nThat is the double tree that is right next to the U.S sillier a center or even this new hotel proposed project cars they're sitting there right along for street which is the railroad tracks\nYeah it's really interesting because here we are again\nPlanning a potential hotel near the railroad tracks and historically we've done that a lot in downtown Cedar Rapids history and we the reason for the past was because most hotel travelers used to travel by train and they need to hotels in close proximity to the river stations\nA worthy doubled tree in hotels today there were there were many hotels that that exact same site in Cedar Rapids fast a coating of a very very nice hotel called the grand hotel that was really the leading hotel in Cedar Rapids from\nThe Eighteen eighties uh well into the almost Nineteen ten to Fifteen there was a famous Coleman hotel on that site a hotel known as the normal for many many years of course many people remember between the um first avenue\nSecond Avenue on the block along the train tracks the Alice in the hotel and the banks all tell a soul but now with this new hotel a proposal being the next block doubts from that second or third um you're right it can be kind of a we don't really have to put a hotel next to the train tracks were trained travelers\nBut of course the ... hotel um has a lot of a\nSoundproof unit it's building I think that that makes it worked just fine right there to honor by the train tracks but I Love the historic connection oh you know putting another\nA combination of you know hotel facilities you potentially a old historically and new\nHotel property a into kind of this just the same area that we ... we had put up a lot of hotels there's a lot of auto history a lawyer I really liked it a tie and so the trains will keep talking by but\nYou know we we we put in recent railroad crossing you know or they have a a just supposed to be less noise with some of those but it will be remain as he looks like a tradition that will continue is that people read you a ... in hotel rooms a within a block of the of the railroad tracks\nAdopted wrap something we've been doing impact too about Eighteen sick they\nOkay and of course ... while we're in the neighborhood since it's so close by I'm going to ask you just real briefly to finish up this segment here this first segment of Cedar Rapids Senate now a green square it's now and he was traditionally green square park\nHas always been a green space in downtown Cedar Rapids ... relatively new development\nOh no no that's always been a green space and of course we called green square not because it's green green grass but it's named after a judge Kurt green so totally agreeing with an e on him so anybody out there wherever references to green square or or whatever the balls and event there we always try to remind people that should have any on the end of the name green agreeing with an e\nUh no it has always been the very very beginning rabbits history when the when the city was first ah establish\nEven before it was incorporated legally town a day to forty nine and of course it was read charter later in the city a few fifty six but even before those early days in the early Eighteen forties\nAs the grid system of downtown streets of blocks are being laid out a while we now know as green squirrels actually laid out um [noise] as a a a permanent green space for the entire community\nTo enjoy it kind of a city square uh uh it's always been referred to as a square up sometimes we call green square park but it's real official and and even legal name is is that it's a short green square\nUm green square that the original name for that a square block of open space in downtown there between or out in force out into train track history\nUm before that uh it was noted Washington Square cause or ebony Washington high school or they sell a side of the square which is that where the public library is and it was Nineteen oh six that they decided to rename but after a judge George Green and that was part of the festivities\nOf Nineteen oh six the summer of Ninety six we had a large community celebration commemorating the ... anniversary of the night of the Eighteen fifty six charter\nA that made the replica fisheries city and we had a big celebration idealistic and that's when it was raining green square\nAnd you know from Washington Square somebody older or maps we have a history center\nOr even have a reference to an end even earlier David Washington even represent to being called a Franklin square Franklin square ah like before the civil war and that could have something to do with the fact that there was there was a said she'd rip street in Franklin\nUh but uh Franklin Washington a greener kind of these it's also interesting to know that it wasn't the only square a green space that was planned for downtown area that was actually a\nAnother one that was three blocks to the north that it's completely forgot now in Cedar Rapids history was between B. avenue and see it and the train tracks and fifth street I'm In what's known as ... square and Isaac widow was another Cedar Rapids judge like judge short grade he was actually the first mayor of the city [noise]\nOh absolutely in

conversation that Justice Roberts had last Thursday about an anti Boeing program were sort of Rapids rough riders coach Marco some Cedar Rapids police chief wing German in Cedar Rapids police officer Shannon Sampson\nCedar Rapids city council persons Suzie why not also joined the discussion for the lip sync challenge\nCoach and Tammy approach this last year and they want it to a\nGet together that he not to conquer bullying in the community and so they decided that\nThey're the rough riders decided that that's what they want it to do so we met we formed a student committee with students from middle schools and talent and uh met with him several times then put together this program and yesterday was our first presentation and went awesome the players did well coached did well it was it was perfect we loved\nIt and it's just such a quiet guy I mean you you you got to get any\nWords [laughter] I was talking yesterday\nFor the week I coach I mean what is it like you I mean you guys and I say that collectively guys and gals with the rough riders are kind of like a a an ambassador\nIf you will to the city where and it's a great way to bridge the gap where you've got younger kids you're dealing with what Eighteen Nineteen twenty year olds on the team bringing everybody together where you've got young role models that you get a chance to help mold into men when they when they come through your program\nYeah no for sure Justin and that's um that's you know what it means I absolutely love the number one thing I Love about junior hockey and uh we always say that were running a program you know what the rough riders notches the hockey team and we want to do it the best we can do to improve our guys as as people and also as players in this uh\nYou know this a deal that were running now with the ah the anti bullying um there's been awesome so far and are just\nFull marks and I want to be clear on this this this was all officers Sampson and Tammy they they got together and got rocking on us and I'm I'm thrilled to be a part of it and I just think obviously chief as well and um this is only the beginning\nAnd Tammy literally two feet behind me right now if you're on the Facebook she's putting this on Facebook Live right now so um but ... chief I mean this is this dials right into what everything we talk about every month getting together\nAnd you know being a positive influence on you within the community and that kinda translates into so much more positivity for everybody here that spot on and\nYou know last year when when Shannon uh\nApproached us that this was something that uh the rough riders in the car Austin's wanted to do it it was a perfect fit\nAnd uh they they took the ball or the ... whatever you want to ... uh that they've attached a name to it and uh yesterday was just a chick often of a lot more great things to calm\nWell get with it being a kickoff that was me my next question is this is just this is ground level yesterday was ground level what's the potential for this what's the what's the goal as we move now and you know to to round two and into the third period ended it see I I got hockey phrases too [laughter]\nWe're really hoping to get out into the middle schools around the house and get the information out and get the players out there in the community they want to be involved and really\nWhen you think about it and just looking at that the fed through eighth graders yesterday out in the middle school they're so excited to see the players there and they were paying attention and engaged and listening and that's what we want because this is a very important message that we want them all to to hear an ... member and\nAnd obviously put to use and make sure that they are respecting others and you know dealing with bowling when it happens\nYeah I mean it's and you hear so much about it and I think as adults I think we're all kind of guilty we we all bully a bit too much maybe it was we all should sit through something like this to every once in a while maybe you'll start going from office to office coach for some of these players everybody's different office 'cause I think we all need to be reminded from time to time that bullying at any age isn't good well\nI I agree a hundred percent and we've been thinking a lot about this and we know we really tried to make the point yesterday and as you said even with adults I mean\nHow boring would it be if everybody look the same ... acted the same and it's I think it's great that there's people have different you know heights and and different sizes and different colored hair and and and different nationalities and different accents and the people that have different interests and if we can bring all these things together and let's look for the good\nAnd people and let's be great um you know workmates and classmates and teammates and if we can continue to spread out I think it can become contagious in and we can do great things here in our community\nAnd coach or I should say chief that might start calling you coach from now and just so you know when I didn't hear what when when a marketing Tammy and when she came to us let's do something like this how do you take it from idea into now hitting the ground running with it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cedar Rapids Then & Now", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "28"}
