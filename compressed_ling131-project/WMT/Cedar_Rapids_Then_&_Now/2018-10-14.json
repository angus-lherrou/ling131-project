{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Yeah it's kind of like ours I say I've had a heart of hearts issues and heart surgery and it's like if my take her can't handle watching the stock ticker then it's not good you know you shouldn't obsess over that because it's one of those things we all tend to do it a little bit and it's kind of natural but\nIf you've got that solid plan and that solid footing already behind you those things won't bother you as much I think I was just reading um I'm not exactly sure the sore so not a hundred percent on it but I was just reading a something that they put out the other day that said\nWhen the fed chairman make certain comments as Costa mark at one point two trillion or something this year because it'll move zero point for four percent you know this way or that are up and down\nAnd then it comes back and it's like that's just you know that kind of story just gets people's blood worked up and it's like is not something that you need to do having that solid plan will help you\nNot have to pay attention to them a new show I guess as where we're kind of go on with that so another indicator as we're talking about here on the program that you might\nNeed to make some adjustments if some of these things are causing you kind of stress or heartache a with the guys are premier advisors were talking about these and they can certainly help you you know get through some of that stuff if you've got questions or concerns eight four four\nFour to four plan will final thought here Tony I'll let you take this one and of course that's the long term care expense I usually say nursing home but I've I've got a break myself of that because it's not just nursing homes anymore right there's a lot that goes into the whole thing of long term care expenses\nOh yeah absolutely I mean most people want to be able if they they do have any kind of feeling health they do want to stay on their own home I Would think that it's in my experience I think taught her degree that that's going to the number one thing people want to do to stay in their own home their own bed\nFor as long as possible one is it's the most comfortable surroundings and to you really don't want to feel like somebody has to take care of you that you're a burden on somebody and you know anytime you have a long term care type situation whether it's a big one or a small one you know it really impacts family and friends it impacts those around you\nIt's happening to you but it impacts those around you you so it's more of a situation that's far more encompassing now if you think that nursing home or or long term care expenses will take care of themselves\nI got to tell you most likely not and here's the reason why there is already set up in this country Medicaid\nWhich will take care of you but you basically have to bring down your assets to next to nothing roughly two thousand dollars to your name and if you give away assets and the seven years prior to asking for Medicaid they can potentially claw back some of that money so\nThere is right now a system in place but if you look at the baby boomer generation moving through our society you know it's a big group in the population a big chunk of people\nAnd we're going to start seeing that border chunk of people as they age need more medical attention and they're going to put a lot more strain on the Medicaid system that may cause it to change or be different than the way we see now could stay the same it could also change\nBut there are a lot of things that you can do now to help prepare so that you take care of yourself instead of waiting to see what the system will do for you if anything at all in the future such things as long term care insurance\nTheir conditions with certain policies that if you have a long term care plan and you use it that it will protect some of your assets from the spend down provisions that Medicaid has\nYou can also set up a new ways to create lifetime dreams of income to help offset potential nursing home or home health care costs in the future and\nYou know some of those have the ability to bump up those payments depending on what's affecting you some life insurance policies have built in the ability to pull out some of the death benefit early accelerate that a benefit and use it for long term care options so there's flexibility there\nTo give you several levers that you can pull later in life to help you out so you don't have to rely on the government has Medicaid because you don't really know what that's going to look like the Tony want my kids to take care of me [laughter]\nYou you hope so [laughter] yep so right but you know younger generations are becoming a lot more mobile a lot of them aren't staying at home they're getting jobs all over the country they're wanting to do a lot of other things you know it's a different mindset a different mentality than it was decades ago and so\nYou should really focus on self reliance get a plan prepared to take care of yourself go through a checklist find somebody who is passionate about this industry about helping you and giving you strategy and choices you don't have to come in and ask questions and then we're going to expect you to buy an investment from us you can answer their questions\nEducation it's up to you if you want to do business with us or not if you see value there or not but you can at least get some knowledge and in part some education to yourself so that you can become a lot more self reliant\nMark here's what we're going to do right now we are very very passionate at premier advisors about our community being well prepared for retirement and what we want to do is extend that opportunity right now\nTo you to help make sure that you're well prepared we're going to offer complimentary financial review if you call in the next Fifteen minutes have at least a hundred thousand dollar save for retirement what we're going to do is talk to you about retirement income needs where the and incomes going to come from\nAnd also how you'll outpaced inflation pay as little as possible and taxes and make sure truly that you don't outlive your money now you might say I don't really have to call and the next Fifteen minutes and yes that's true you could probably take care of it next week or next month but here's kind of the real deal we've been coaching\nWell on retirement planning for very long time\nAnd what we've learned that is it's very easy to procrastinate or get distracted\nSo if you don't start the process now there is a very good chance you're probably won't do it at all so the first coaching lesson that we can teach us to encourage you to take that first step right now for almost everybody that's the hardest part it's that kind of the hurdle that you need to get over\nBut from there it's really not a painful process to getting like going to a doctor you got to schedule the appointment with the doctor in order to go in and get things done and\nFigure everything out so if you're ready to finally get a plan in place give us a call right now\nAnd again folks that number is eight for for for two for playing really well said from Tony here on the program eight four four four to four plan\nAnd get yourself on the counter come in and asked you questions have the conversation and find out if it's the right fit for you to continue on from there but at least get these questions to answer we talk about it every week it's so important there are so many more people retiring everyday or getting close to retirement\nAnd having that knowledge there is certainly going to help with peace of mind and in Todd was a you know being a little facetious there and saying well my kids not helped me and I think none of us really want that most people really want\nAlso these kids are listening yeah [laughter] exactly\nI think a lot of us really want to be self reliant and so a great way obviously is to take that onus on to ourselves\nAnd just get that plan in place and make sure we're doing the things are under our own power our own steam if you will so a lot of what we teach our kids right as a growing up you know making sure on your own you know make it into your own power your own steam all the same thing can be said when we get to retirement age we got to kind of use our own words against ourselves and say let's do this and get it\nDingell very well and the chamber of commerce just two years later\nCame up a sort of the kinds of of yet another book a which is published in Nineteen Seventy three and by that time they kind of changed the idea of the city is a little bit to simplify a little bit and have sort of the uh\nThe for regular seasons in the fifth season was kind of emphasized as the fifth season has time to enjoy time to enjoy the quality of life\nIn the Cedar Rapids area uh that we have 'em all the components to make sure that when you're not working and are just wonderful places to uh enjoyed a recreational facilities or the community and entertainment and the culture and so forth\nAnd there was actually taken from a religious passage of you know time is so precious and\nHaving the time to enjoy and having to think\nThat you enjoy your quality of life it really kind of was a concept of the quality of life so people can understand the four seasons\nBut that curious to see in the fifties and the time to enjoy the quality of life with in the other four seasons so that was really kind of the idea of it and it was really kind of a you know at at the time and Nineteen Seventy one to her so much change going on\nThere was kind of resurgence of a you know people are enjoying where recreation time today it ever had before you know the forty hour week I've been established for quite a while to work weekends so that was really kind of the idea of the city of ... and ah then later on that kind of modify the logo didn't so much looked like the NBC peacock\nBut evolved by the late Nineteen seventies into the image that we see today which has kind of a a circular kind of half circular a features but kind of the longest one coming out the bottom the original color of it was orange or the logo of the city if I was orange for the city and then they really\nBuilt up the premise as they developed a civic center\nThe intention was to call that five student center to really promote the logo the city adopted the logo for all of its vehicles for all the letterhead a so this combination effort of the chamber of commerce a which is now known as the economic alliance and the city government to kind of create these um [noise]\nA method of really um\nAdvertising the idea that seed rapid as the city of seasons now in more recent years we've changed the color of the logo to city of privacy than from orange\nDark green kind of a forest or natural green and so now she kinda that green kind of a mini me a forgotten that it was originally orange and one interesting a\nSide effect of the original orange color every time you saw the original logo in the late Nineteen seventies or the study of ideas and one of the orange that many people still remember out there uh when the seasons center opened and for many of its early years all the seats in the arena we're orange then\nWe're orange seats in the fight scenes that are now known as the U. S. L. you're so and then of course all this led to the creation of the tree of five seasons are just over Twenty years ago to kind of this cultural a form of this logo that was developed in the Nineteen seventies\nWe also in the past I'm Mark can we just have a couple of minutes but but what about some other cities Morgan's real briefly when they were used to and uh I Know was one officially cereal city I Know that probably came out of the Quaker Oats and have a ... I think national\nTo the time I think it's wrong foods currently but uh we were known for serial because General Mills also on board as part of the industrial base for the city of sitting around it's a part of the city I Know is one so I'll just give us a brief time line and when those were actually in effect\nAnd somebody has a little more efficient than others and uh probably the most official earlier names was to parlors city and this this was used in promoting Cedar Rapids in Nineteen century going in the early twenty century it was it officially sanctioned by the city government and the community um this concept there was a it was a late Victorian\nEra idea uh people most people had a sort of a city in real more parlor in their home\nUh especially the uh the middle and upper class um even some of the lower and middle class homes in Cedar Rapids in a partner was\nThe most important role in your house it was kind of where\nYour gas in your family really got kind of the impression of of who you were and how you kept your home and so the ... set a lot about a a people\nAnd so people are proud of their ... and that was really kind of an an image statements so at the same time Cedar Rapids in the nineteenth century was was very well known for keeping most of the city in a very very neat parents a lot of very good maintenance that happened in Cedar Rapids to the streets always seems\nNeat and tidy to lawns the houses and so forth\nAnd people would start to remark to Cedar Rapids was so neat and appearance\nIt was like your parlor home it just seemed like a\nThe the whole uh parents of the community was like my parlor and so that's where the kind of the coin of the coin of the term to Potter city came about is that it's a the town's appearances as nice as the Victorian parlor and one of the biggest impressions of that was a view that people had when they came in on the train station down a green square and they look out over the green square\nAnd they see this really neat set up a churches schools and libraries and so forth\nAnd and that's when they they really got the idea that this was a very neat Victorian part of the type of image and like you mentioned rented the um the serial capital\nOf the world was really not quite as official but uh yeah that was used quite\nLiberally for a long time just cereal capital of the world Cedar Rapids Iowa\nWe're
