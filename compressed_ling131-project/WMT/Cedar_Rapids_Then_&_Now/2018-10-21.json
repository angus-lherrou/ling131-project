{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "There is a section there in the small fine print but at the Boulder and has a little starting next to it where the Social Security administration is estimating that by twenty thirty for benefits may be reduced to roughly Seventy seven percent of what they are estimated to be you know above that\nThat area on the on the statement and those numbers the percentages and dates or have fluctuated over the last decade or so\nUh but I looked through some past Social Security statements and it's been there they've been shouting the warning in small bowl [laughter] starting next to it as much out in order you know it's kind of like going down the mountain pass you know we're all on a train and the\nAh Social Security administration as a conductor at the front and he or she sees that ah the tracks route\nAnd is yelling at us hey the tracks around but\nNone of us here we're in the dining car or the bar car or whatever in the back you know not really thinking about it and leadership in our country isn't really focusing on it either but it's something that has a potential impact all of us\nBecause it really the only way to fix it is is probably to raise taxes or extend out your age or reduce benefits yeah I'm now and that can impact somebody's retirement income plan you know it's not just\nSocial Security can be one of the biggest components to your income plan but you also have to think about the types of accounts you know the of cash accounts protected accounts wrote accounts what are the tax ability of those withdraws how are you going to pull that money out you know to to going to take it back on some of the things we're talking about before\nWas telling it to your point a lot of people do use Social Security as a big piece of it but if we're being proactive and making it that piece of reduced role then if something does change it doesn't affect you nearly as badly so taking those steps to have other streams of income coming in and that retirement income plans certainly\nA good advice from the team here on premier advisors and my own two cents on the Social Security I'm with you I think they're going to have to make some changes probably for folks fifty five and ... there's no going to be any changes really needed but I can I'm forty seven I could see maybe some sort of change happening even for my\n... even if it's something as simple as they remove the sixty two and it just becomes sixty five or you can start\nI've read a couple of different things we're moving it back to two or three years might funded for another hundred years\nYou know so there's just a lot of ways they can make some minor adjustments and it's always a political poker chip anyway so every administration is going to wait till the last second or do something but we'll see how that goes back on targeted those signs of a good financial health and the guys are right on the nose we've given you for things that if you have any of these in your\nLined up for you you're probably you know got some good financial health work in and of course the team will be happy to let you bounced those off of them and they can talk with you about um helping tweak those and improve it\nBut if you do spend less than you make and you do have a knowledge of tax implications and the future on your savings in both parties understand the retirement plan you have their retirement income plan\nThat the guy just talking about well then maybe you won't have to worry too much about your financial future and that's our final sign of good financial health if you have these things in place you might be okay and if not well that's where you guys coming\nOh absolutely mark you know it's tough to find somebody who doesn't have at least some\nWorry about their financial future so if you came in and said I've got no worries\nThat's going to want I'm either going to be real happy you got it all figured out or to you don't know what you don't know there are things that you haven't you know considered that maybe we need to bring up that second opinion like Marty mentioned\nSo it's important to us to make sure people are comfortable with their financial future I don't know if there'll be completely worry free but it should be stress free\nUh that's the whole point of retirement you put in all this time to work or you should be able to do what you want to do and retirement and not stress out about it when when did you say Romney\nYeah I think that's the other half of the mark and Tony is are people worried about their financial future in we know what kind of stress that puts on everybody so uh we want to take the worry off the table\nI Can't go back to the uh the guaranteed income that's your takes a lot of my wife and my worries off the table\nJust sitting down and making sure that that's all going to be there but I think in Tony I don't know if you disagree or not but uh you know a lot of our callers that that we have coming in and we sit down and we talk with them I'm pleasantly surprised that a lot of them do have plans that they have stuff kind of put together\nAnd then we just helping them tweak it a little bit and I feel so much better now than than years ago when people had no idea what was going on so congratulations to a lot of the folks out there\nThat have come in and talk to us or want to talk to us you are putting together some good retirement plans out there and\nI think second opinion is getting to be one of the biggest things we have right now\nYeah and Marty when did you say also may be a turning point is when people come in and say 'cause I've seen this happen I'm sure you have as well\nPeople come in and say well I Want to spend it and if there's something left the kids can have it but later down the road after they're done a lot of the things checked off their bucket list in retirement they start thinking about it and saying you know what\nMaybe I Will start thinking about that legacy may you know I'm now comfortable enough to know that I can continue to do what I Want to do and retirement and I actually I'm going to have a little bit of extra so let me put together a plan for that you were saying that to\nWhere she had quite a bit of that as far as the legacy planning a because again take a little access I get talked about before\nYou really only have three buckets airs charity and the IRS and they'd never pick the IRS naturally but uh most of that go into the air so we really sit down and help them set down and do some of that there are so you know get them awake in a little bit to to what's all out there and they really appreciate that\nBut folks uh you gotta understand we're really passionate about our community being well prepared for retirement\nAnd we want to extend an offer do right now to help you be sure that you're well prepared so we're going to offer a complementary financial review to you if you call in the next Fifteen minutes and have at least a hundred thousand dollars save for retirement we'll talk about your retirement income needs were that income is going to come from\nHow you're gonna outpaced inflation\nPay as little as possible probably on taxes and make sure that you don't outlive your money that's one of the crucial issues right there now you might say I don't really have to call in the next Fifteen minutes and yes it's true you could probably take care of it next week or next month\nBut here's the deal we've been coaching people on retirement planning for a long time and we've learned that it's really easy to procrastinate\nOr get distracted so if you don't start the process now there's probably a pretty good chance\nYou're not going to do it at all so the first coaching tip that we'd like to give is that we're going to encourage you to take the first step right now for almost everybody that's the hardest part from there it's really not a very painful process

two churches and not just a one in Cedar Rapids I Want to Lisbon airline county so it's a great story and a great flight story that starts here is that they were known to have\nBeen really excited when their father brought all kind of this kind of toy contraption that had the ability to fly once you kind of\nPulled at a certain way and all All right himself kind of mentioned that he was inspired to learn more about flying apparatus based on the toilet his father brought home to him in Cedar Rapids Iowa that we really are kind of the\nYou know some of the inspiration for air travel on air flight really has its beginnings in Cedar Rapids and of course the Wright brothers left and they had her for a successful flight Ninety three what we start seeing people bringing aircraft to Cedar Rapids we have records of around the nine eleven\nAnd the thing is that people were very fascinated by early air travel and aircraft\nAnd as you mentioned rented are already in the early days thinking about the possibilities for uh\nIt's using airplane for free services you know because up until that time railroad was a way to go for all of your express packages and so forth you know we think about all the things in order you know\nOn line and so forth to have to get transport it at some point and in the past you always went to the railroad station and you use the river will companies would have they are afraid stations that kind of handle all of this enormous free\nSo air travel is really kind of a an ... an aircraft was was quite the novelty going into the twentieth century we have really accounts in the history center our cars that show demonstrations of really aircraft happening as early as Nineteen uh Lebanon in Cedar Rapids\nAnd the only way that could happen is that the what you would have to have kind of an open area that was big enough for an aircraft the land and take off and of course you know that means you have to have something that would resemble something like today's\nEastern Iowa airport or an airport and we didn't have any concept of airport we just had a large open and the fields and we have a lot of um\nRecords that showed us some of the earliest aircraft that flew\nIn and out of the Cedar Rapids for kind of entertainment and demonstration purposes was on the spot in West Cedar Rapids called Simpsons past year it was up on the top of the hill if you go up first avenue asked at the top of the hill they're very close to\nI'm kind of a high plateau there were today you'll see things like Cleveland Park\nAnd the trinity Lutheran Church in school and you know very close to the colonel baseball park was kind of a flat area up there on top of the hill and we have some photographs and records that show that people will go up to the west end a Cedar Rapids and get up to the top of the hill and nothing was there but open fields and watches early aircraft land\nAnd then we had a very entrepreneurial local businessman named Dan hunter not related to me I Know we have we we share the same last name\nBut Dan hunter was quite the visionary for air cargo a business and he started up a private ... airfield\nPretty close to Nineteen twenty not too long after that and he chose a location because they're actually was the question in the Nineteen twenties when airplanes really became a lot safer to came to a lot more prevalent\nAnd it became a real option for passenger travel and uh transporting freight and cargo and goods and so forth as an alternative to rail which it really kind of dominated that for so many years and they were starting to take a photograph from airplanes and we kind of the first of\nErrol plain view of Cedar Rapids we we have on record as about Nineteen twenty three\nAnd so the Nineteen twenties was kind of a decade in Cedar Rapids history where they felt like well should we build an airport shall we have an airfield\nAmazingly because people had loved the trains for so long and there was talk of starting to pave highways to enact truck travel around the mid west and to Cedar Rapids\nThe citizens of Cedar Rapids actually they had opportunities to vote for him in in support airport and they actually voted that down\nIn the Nineteen twenties and even into the Nineteen thirties so thin hunter\nDecided to build a private airfield and then you would contract with people to move people in ... in and out of Cedar Rapids and the location he chose was on one of the old routes to Iowa City from Cedar Rapids today we know that as bowling street\nIn Kirkland boulevard and he uh it's also at the location of where today highly thirty or sex or to the highway thirty kind of divides the road on one side of highway thirty it's bowling street\nOn the other side on the south side it's known as ... boulevard and it was at that location very close to where there's a building um near Fifth Avenue south was\nThat for many years was middle and forge and I think believe now is a truck turning the truck driving training building for\nCritical community college that's we're hunters field was there was a hunter airfield there and even had a restaurant there he had a series of runways put in there and some of the people that he worked with that Dan hunter work with we are talking to the Nineteen twenties in the Nineteen thirties\nWe see the first activity of early air cargo an air freight going in and out of Cedar Rapids\nIn some of the customers that Dan hunter head at his private airfield out there where people like Arthur ... of the early college radio company and Howard hall of the early island manufacturing company and they often have private airplanes and private uh uh some of these types of individuals that have private aircraft and would contract with Mr hunter\nTo ah bring a people and a good in by air and so this was all happening before World War two but it was all the air travel and air freight services we hadn't seen wrap this included male male being delivered by air you know we we had some early history of that happening in this time period and Nineteen twenties and thirties\nBut again it was all privately control privately handled\nIt took the world war it took World War two to change the minds of Cedar Rapids presidents and at that point the or the military decided that they needed to have it'll patient to uh be set aside\nTo potentially land military aircraft during the war because she'd Rapids is seen as a very vital\nSite in World War two because of the types of industry we had we had a lot what they called war essential industries in Cedar Rapids shows everything from\nCollege radio to Iowa manufacturing the century engineering to the large scale bakeries we had like Peter Pan bakery we were making a lot of products in Cedar Rapids that we're a providing products to help when\nThe war effort for America during World War two and because of that the ... the United states for the federal government wanted to have an area set aside as a potential um\nAirfield and they chose this is where we first see the beginnings of creating an airfield and uh and landing site where the current eastern Iowa airport is this was in the early Nineteen forties and a decision is made to locate on what we now call Wright brothers boulevard\nA very close to the ... year old line in the spot that was known as a ... mark for a long long time and that's when it started and then after the war was over uh the citizens of Cedar Rapids realize the value they realize that pretty economic\nStability of the future of Cedar Rapids that it wasn't enough to keep on having good rail service and paving roads and having good roads coming in Cedar Rapids they realize that the future of commerce in Cedar Rapids was to build an airport\nAnd it was the U.S in the Nineteen forties um that the the voters of Cedar Rapids really supported the idea of what was referred to as a municipal airport and that's when the uh the beginning of that happen it didn't have much in the beginning of for anyone out there who is old enough to remember the first\nPermanent Cedar Rapids airport Cedar Rapids evidence for airport was actually\nA the terminal is actually an old farmhouse we actually use an old farmhouse in the late Nineteen forties early Nineteen fifties I'm On part of the site that is now part of the larger eastern our airport so people would go get on into a passenger airplane and the first two major airlines\nThat service Cedar Rapids were United Airlines and those are a lot of people remember the first flight I Know I did I flew out in an Ozark when I was a kid a Ozark Airlines is major major aircraft carriers are taking passengers and freight\nAnd an artist Cedar Rapids happening in the late Nineteen forties early Nineteen fifties or people loved it they love the uh the option of using a aircraft\nA local vendors and companies love the idea of a starting up up more and more air freight services and is very very quickly led to the building of the ... of the first permanent\nUh Cedar Rapids ... airport terminal that was Nineteen fifty three five member I was a Howard are green um engineering project to build that structure and built expanded airport with a\nA modern runways for the time uh with the airport to a fully modern airport opened up in Cedar Rapids by two fifty free replacing the old farm also people that I have to uh get out of an old farmhouse to get on to a a modern aircraft and then that's when a real modern um\nAirport and aviation history really began proceed Rapids in Nineteen fifty three and this'll terminal is a real favorite for the locals is a beautiful building that had a beautiful front entrance uh they had sort of like just a\nA colored glass window that looks like a ... kind of over the front entrance there which is a beautiful welcome there I'm On the backside like when he came in and out on the planes you see this wonderful sign that said welcome to Cedar Rapids you had a restaurant called terrorists room where people could go up and look at\nThey didn't have to go any particular set space to stop and downtown cedar up it was simply stop on the middle of the street say like in the middle third avenue\nBy killings department store and passengers would just drop off get off the street car in the middle in the middle of the street well buses created an interesting challenge because buses couldn't really stop in the middle of street because they were larger there are a little bit more cumbersome and they needed a park somewhere downtown so what they had to start doing when the buses system started\nIs that they had to create certain bus parking zones\nA at certain locations uh into downtown loop and in those days of course everybody went downtown after all the retail center was all the services that people wanted to go to and so they had to give a valuable parking spaces in downtown Cedar Rapids\nTo park the buses along the curves and for many many years of they would be at locations like in front of the Armstrong department store\nOr in front of the merchants angel bank on Second Avenue and I'm so three or four different routes depending on where they where they would have to kind of\nYou know time to bus route so that they didn't have them all come down in the exact same time because there's only so much room for buses to park downtown and this is kind of the situation downtown for several decades the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies the buses got larger and they just had certain locations downtown or buses are part\nAnd then in the um the Nineteen sixties after we were where where's farm market grocery store closed down\nThey um in the years before this building at second evidence surgery became the Web or senior center\nThey had a fairly kind of data had one major kind of a bus a\nStationary it was kind of a it wasn't really a bus station as much as sort of a place where they have like a little booth\nWhere you can get information about the bus routes in Cedar Rapids on the third street side\nOf what we might call today the white star restaurant building deal that were senior center it's real five Second Avenue and they had kind of a spot that where people could sit and wait for buses but now all of this was an adequate and so for a long time as early as the Nineteen sixties and seventies there was a real um\nDesire to build kind of a permanent bus station for downtown Cedar Rapids republic buses and that's when the concept of the ground transportation center really kind of a cold\nAnd they will see it as also kind of an economic\nGenerator for downtown to kind of a put a new building that would be a a a a bus station in a part of downtown Cedar Rapids that\nKind of needed a you know re boots and this has had a set of plans for the ground transportation really kind of an active uh immediately following the construction of other major downtown products like the five students better and so going into the Nineteen eighties uh there were actually the ground has fish that it was tied into a much larger project\nTo build an office tower a parking ramp and the Cedar Rapids public library in Nineteen eighty so these are two blocks that were set aside from fourth avenue to sixth avenue\nFrom first street the second street uh where they would have a a\n... story tower office tower and underneath this\nThey would have a finally a permanent station for the buses ah and it was a multi purpose facility in the early years just opened in November of Nineteen eighty three and a it wasn't just the city buses that park here we also had the uh the uh the transportation for companies like greyhound\nAnd a trail a trailblazer somebody's other buses that traveled across the country so it's kind of a multi purpose that is why they call it that GTC the ground transportation center where this is where he went for bus transit down here and everybody could go to a set location\nTo do that one of the night features they had when they open the ground constitution center in downtown cedar after Nineteen eighty three\nIs they're able to find a new home this is a nice time to what we're talking about earlier Randy is that uh there was just wonderful globe of the earth that rotated and it was actually put in the old Cedar Rapids airport Nineteen fifty three\nAnd was privately funded by Howard hauling part and it was a taken out of the airport when airport built new in Nineteen eighty eight\nI'm so when the ground transportation center a opened up they found they were able to move this globe has been in the airport and put it in the relatively new ground transportation center down there and um\nOf course the ... center was a victim of the of the Nineteen I'm Sorry the two thousand they flood\nAnd there were some concerns or whether they should rebuild there or not uh finally they did make that decision and the rebuilding and the ... of the ah what's now the thirty five year old ground transportation centered a city bus station down there was one of the last comeback project after the flood of two thousand eight was well after\nA twenty twelve before we got the bus station so for a while there we had kind of a temporary bus station down into new bohemian area and a large parking lot near twelve thousand it down there and that was kind of an inconvenience for a while there\nBut really the uh the uh the GTC looks better never as far as the bus or if they had an opportunity to kind of redesigning a especially with the arrival of bringing back to that the two way street\nSo they could re conform to the bus station to conform to the new uh patterns of the streets that we have in downtown Cedar Rapids and as far as that wonderful globe that was down there for years I mean that was that was damaged somewhat during the fall of the two thousand they\nFound yet another new home and transportation icon is actually located now out a critical at community college and Lynn hall and I loved it as his story because that means is just right down the street from the early hunter airfield we talked about the first part of the program\nJust down the street on critical boulevard and by the way to early hunter airport we talked about uh that closed up sometime in the Nineteen fifties when the Cedar Rapids airport\nBecame far more important to the community but uh it's kind of the history of buses and so we've really had the same\nA Center for city transit for city bus transit or this is the thirty fifth year that in fact
