Penn State seems to have more than their fair share a especially defensively they're missing some secondary people uh their their defense of ants which I think is the strength of their ... their beat up the fact they're out there all star\nSharif Miller there's some talk about whether or not he'll play today\nA or play sparingly and then they have a a safety that has to miss the first half because they were targeting call\nA last week one of their better defenders or will not play on the first thirty minutes hopefully the hawks can\nChoke I you know choke them down and get a lead a and then hang onto it in and steadily building cars that defense has been so good all year long giving up fourteen points a game I I think twenty five points today when's it\nWell that's what happened last time I have a one in this series in twenty ... twenty four points ironically that was the last time both high when Penn State were ranked in the top twenty\nAlso and was that the Adrian ... born a twenty than what land right yeah the punt blocked by Adrian for a touchdown and the light that today [laughter] it wasn't only you'd probably take the forward today too and yeah [laughter] you know there's no pat\nAngers running around out there for the hawks at linebacker today at least not yet but you look at Adrian clay born in what a career he had at Iowa and that's the strength of this defense now so you know wouldn't be surprising if a\nAnthony Nelson or or a partner has to do I think is playing it as a high a level is anybody in the league defensively wouldn't surprise me at all at one of those guys jars the ball loose from shortly but primarily they've got to keep them inside the hash marks people in the tackle box because he is so lethal\n... to the boundary line either side and I obviously I was aware that\nA lot of talk here as we wrap up golf about if Wisconsin would lose the potential for this Hawkeye football team in the future is this a signature type when is this a turning point game here for this team\nI think ah the next two weeks or at at Penn State at Purdue Andy defined I was season at a different level and I mean they've beaten the teams they're supposed to beat\nWisconsin they could have easily won that game or save for a few mistakes but it didn't happen so now the ... out of the game and hand because they beat your head to head but to me I I'm not even worried about that I mean there there's half the Big Ten season to go yet\nWisconsin has to go to a a Penn State at Purdue just like the hot guys Wisconsin's gotta win in a tough environment today I Know they've got an early turnover and scored against the Wildcats but\nUh I'd almost rather see Wisconsin one today because of what they have a head of the because north western has to come to Iowa City and so I you know what whether we pull for this team or that team the bottom line is there's still a months to go\nA month in ... in a in a week and so so much is going to happen I can promise you end up both divisions between now and the end of November\nHopefully some of that that we are talking about is a positive for the ...\nWell I guess I should have said you just gotta take care of your own business ... and these next two weeks I think defined Iowa or as to heading toward the top ten ranking or maybe settling in where they are you know there are a lot of the well gee we can just get a split or if we can\nWendy's to buy some rhyme or reason let me tell you this defense is legit this defense is real this defense will keep you in ball games on the road and tough environments like this this defense were when you football games if you don't turn it over\nWhere rocky my Fridays frozen custard and steak burgers here aren't ... by the way it will mention the burgers will mention my favorite one coming up but how about this ... pumpkin pie concrete ... for a limited time only ... creamy frozen custard landed with a whole slice of pumpkin pie crust like\nAn all voters Halloween to that will almost a a\nUpstaged the signature deserted ... the turtle\nThe turtles Sunday yeah these are the ...

running for form it's also not with a hundred yard Russia\nNinety eight was his closest that got for ivory Kelly interview today that changes\nBut to the um\nThe majority of well and not the majority

Thursday when I kind of broke this down\nA ... a Penn State still six and a half point favorite as of today you know here we are uh two hours and ... fourteen minutes away from kick off and it is still that needle has not moved other than maybe down a point now Penn State is a five point fate yeah of course they're getting three and a half for the for me in the home team yeah to a point you know pretty a pretty\nLow pretty well evenly matched though I mean you look at it innate Stanley sixteen touchdown six interceptions a ... eleven touchdowns three interceptions rushing Yard's not too far away I mean and it it's almost you could almost draw a line right down the middle and haven't evenly spaced out\nYou know so then it's going to be about coaching game planning it'll be about execution of course turnovers who are probably once again and we heard from Kurt ferrets earlier on the uh incredible senior leadership that we've seen from the steam part of it comes on the offensive line with the center senior Keegan\nRight out of it are a lot of factors um you know one of them's or just a continuing narrative of our our experience levels a lot better than it was the last few years uh especially last year I mean we're so young at all skill positions in an office taco position so\nThat makes a tougher to be successful one third of 'em but you know we've talked about that I think beyond that I think our coach is not a good job come up with a plan workable plan for third now\nMost importantly reporters was executed and then five cut it down with a you know have a success

any yet to arrest that are out there called not calling for another uh you know a touchdown I taught in the end zone why not it's style points man though this is all sprinkles on top of the donut now you know\nUm how about that whole ah ugly when versus pretty last spring hey winds when right when is willow in\nAny way that they might come yeah and you either have to have to come off of watch to

care field sitting in the country\nBritain are taught gaming Indiana last week and never easy to it on the road and the Big Ten you get it done what ah what well for Penn State that afternoon phrase\nMakes early one well which is typical of how it's happened all year he ran for a hundred and seven yards so that's to another you're rushing games you said the ... he's\nCarry the ball Seventy two times the last four games to Eighteen ties how obviously some of them are maybe a broken past player or whatever but still at Eighteen times a game for a guy that you prefer not that good ...\nA ... and ... miles Sanders I think he I think he's earned more touches because Sanders was really good last week out of the backfield he had a career high and receiving with fifty three yards\nTargeted six times last week made all six catches and between that and the running game standards is going to be a thousand yard Russia this year for them [noise] he's a guy that can take some pressure off and the biggest problem I have had this year offensively that's released all them as they've had\nTwenty five drop passes this year I mean that just crushes an office or something like that happened the thing is one thing you know as with Iowa they convert their third downs forty nine percent forty two percent on third and for better but when they have to make a pass play their guys are making catches and making ...\nSanders what has a press chew and kind of described his style obviously sake warms a generational player a but miles Sanders is a one cut co guy who really fits the offensive line and they all sense of wanting to good straight ahead blocking offensive line they give them a greasy goes\nHe's not a guy that messes around and dances or anything like that he can get to the edge he's got good speed but he also has the ability to get to the whole quickly and then get rolling and I think kids where he's really been a plus he's become a better blocker\nHe's become a better receiver as we're Barclay really ... the last couple of years great receiver well Sanders has become a good receiver which is what they needed\n[noise] he talked about the drops and this wide receiver group as it got better as the season is rolling\nAlong and it's a funny thing is I watch them and practice robbing the catch everything right and they get in the game they got a drop here and a drop their joint Johnson's been getting better as the seasons gone along that's fine random Polk has struggled a bit the last couple of weeks with hanging on to the football\nHandler catches ever learn All right so he catchy he's been fined that he's the big play guy in this off ... I don't think that there's enough ways to get him touches because he is about as exciting a player is uh they've had in a while and I've had some exciting players or\nHow is the fence up front because they're obviously going to go against one of the better defensive line so see yeah they're going to have their work cut out today because I mean this this defense of front I mean I looked at Ohio State obviously and then I went to the tape of Iowa in Iowa was every bit as good as Ohio State is\nThe Iowa guy on the\nHeels hurry into your sinful Midwest Honda dealer\n...

a ... in that case the main thing is that Iowa defense and made Stanley keep doing what you're doing\nWell yeah and this isn't the type a day that you're gonna have to really concentrate on the handling the ball holding on to the ball and this was a regular\nGrass fields were born in a little money to down there something that doesn't happen on synthetic turf so uh yeah it's um it's just not going to be at all since the\nExplosion idle twenty five points might want to I think so yeah yeah I I Would agree with you about it we're we're we're watching\nA heavy drizzle or Mr call it what you watch it rained hard all night long off and on and throughout the morning or as a great running back ... return or kick return or what are the little new watches you look for going from field turf to natural grass on a day like today\nWell one of the things that that will happen it is I think a slows down the pass rush 'em because this is a big effect July ... there are few slip\nOr when they're on a natural grass fields so when I hit the soggy or one of our principal arm and make contact with them just tough for them to get their feet back up ... and ...\nAnd [noise] Penn State is trying to do fifty ... year that's sort of deal or are there almost twenty six or seven now and that was their goal to get fifty first season so let's hope they get some zeroed today\nAnd that's a pretty good number for the Iowa offensive line so let me reverse the lines of scrimmage or and ask you about the old line leads the big tent with only ... shacks allowed water their issues on a turf like today\nWell we're a little better off I think because I'm oral fixation Lyman are are built to Ron oh they're not heavy weights is that in there and slug we pull them a lot we expect to unveil to get on the outside and walk or and so I think they're probably impacted the least or anybody or on a day like this in fact\nA lot of a Pepsi Bhutto's like days like this so\nWell and that's why it's a it's encourage industry that Iowa Ron game come on like it has the last two weeks ...\nWell yeah and and talking to jak ham who's my counterpart here at Penn State this morning he said Indiana last week was second by second and for all day they ran for two hundred and twenty five yards so let's hope that are over ... can put that kind of a running game dinner together today if\nThe trash can run Ninety nine plays like Indiana did last week they should get out of here\nWith the Turks straight road victory Polack you'll be back a little bit later on your he's just scratching the surface to

stopped by today they've got a rap all prizes and\nHide everybody with a big brothers big sisters in Johnson county with that we bring it Hawkeye athletic director Gary bar to Penn State now twenty five years of member of the Big Ten they'd been a great ambassador like all of our institutions very uh\nUh yeah they had the situation in twenty of Lebanon twenty twelve with Sandusky that ah really turn the entire university upside down not just the football program but they seem to have emerged from that a bit but you know the the effects are long standing we get that\nBut uh when you look at it as as a ... an athletic director in this league or\nWhat do you think about when you you're able to promote the effect of Penn State is in the Big Ten conference\nWell first of all I was in ... at the time but I've had conversations with the commissioner Delaney and others about how when we first added Penn State there was a lot of consternation a lot of concern that they weren't going a bit\nBut if you think about it they do fit the profile academically\nOr the size of the institution public research or certainly their fan base in their stadiums there a broad based program they offer a lot of sports so uh they they really are the issues that you mentioned not withstanding they really are a terrific a member of the Big Ten for so many reasons\nWonderful academic institution to an no thankfully it's a greater ... school of new ... Iraq when you look at a soggy turf like today natural grass or how is the quarterback were you able to you know I mean you've got to block it out of your mind you've got to play a game but how did you always approach a day like today\nThe biggest issue you have to get out of your head and just a you know if you have big hands as a quarterback it's an advantage on a day like today because\nThe ball is slippery but the ball is built in such a way or the you know the middle of the ball is built such way if you have large hands you can handle that so I actually this week compared to last week I Would much rather play in a drizzle as a quarterback and play and forty mile an hour gusts so assuming that the voting is\nGood and and as you mentioned they have a they have a reputation for having a great trip I was down there earlier it does look solid um you know I I think it's going to come down to execute as as a ... he said it takes a little\nBit of extra concentration and it would be really nice to have a running game today you know you're sounding like coach ... now a\nTakes a quarterback with big hands Nathan Stanley has huge clauses he calls it so that should bode well for our quarter back\nToday and he prefers wet over windy I like that I like that term uh uh look let's switch sports here because they see the Hawkeye the outstanding Iowa Hawkeye women's field hockey team is here in state college and they play Penn State tomorrow the opening round of the big tent tournament the\nFall season is starting to wind down and a lot of sports in to a cross country team is that they can championships the men in Nebraska this weekend and\nInterestingly we played Penn State here tomorrow in field hockey I think it's two top team top ten teams\nI think we're nine and they're seven uh we we were able to beat them two to one in a close game at home so uh they'll they'll be watching and and cheering on the ... a two day Hawkeye swing through sue happy valley\nIndeed despite the elements and good luck to the men's and women's cross country teams at Lincoln, Nebraska tomorrow for the across country baked and cross country championships it is that time of year isn't it\nIt is and it's a fun time of year and you know clearly with football we're six in one and and I've been asked several times of the commenters may boy big game isn't it this week and I said you know when you're six one every games\nAnd I've noticed you've taken a peek at Wisconsin north western Michigan state Purdue as somebody said earlier you know how do you see this race there are so many so much football left the next as another month of there's\nThere's a reason to college football playoff doesn't come out with its first poll until this week and there's a reason for that early on it's fun to talk about who's ranked where but this is about the week where are the separation begins to occur and clearly ah we're in a situation where we want to separate ourselves the right way to day\nIndeed thanks for coming by ... good to see you guys very barter Hawkeye athletic director uh stopping by and our weapons hybrids pre game show right now it's time for today's Hawkeye historical winning moment presented by riverside casino\nAnd golf resort stopped by the all new draft days sports lounge at riverside casino engulfed where you'll find great food beverages and the top golf swing sweet ready to play or going through an incredible remodeling down their riverside ten plus years old now and\nGet ready for an incredible up three grand opening here coming up\nI think leadership and um you know it really kind of began in the summer I think in earnest and and uh you know such a store or Thirteen seniors are all doing a great job but then we've got a lot of guys are sophomores and juniors that are doing the same thing the juniors are pretty obvious but even a soft more like a tour and young who's a\nYou know split in time and ... but uh he just does everything the way it's supposed to be done so we got a lot of guys really showing the younger players in in its own usual as many younger young players is we have planned but the older guys are showing those guys how to do things on a day to day basis not just at the end the week\nWell let's talk about prepping for the ... the alliance today who is your your scout team here all this week that took a trace mix surely Israel\nYeah good luck on that one uh you know that's just something and duplicate these are really good football player\nAnd clearly the biggest challenge we face to the deposition this season um probably will be the entire season he's used as a really good football player and you know he throws the ball pretty well runs that well he's had a ... you know it's tough to get a shot on as much as he runs you know he's good at getting down are getting out of bounds um\nYou know but I think the biggest attribute is that he's just a guy not only are all sorts of guys we're going to their entire team believes in them so if he's on the field I think they they have a belief that they can win the football game and you know we we um had a good opportunity to get him last year we couldn't do it and so are we going to try to\nBut a loving touchdowns throwing a rushing you use the complete package you might be the most complete quarterback you see this year\nThe earliest I mean I'm In their back up a good player too but he's he's clearly the leader of the football team last year you had him in Berkeley together so it was really a dynamic combination but yeah Berkeley gone but they've got they've always had good players here and that's the same story you know a good running backs and and good receivers\nSo we got her freshman tight and who's really good player so there were at the ... just good team defense because you can't load up in any one area\nIs your first sustained look at my old Saunders or Sanders a I'm not sure any ... in Berkeley but but he's he's very gifted ... what do you like about him\nYeah I mean really outside around a little nobody's Berkeley in my opinion a rental oh is that just a total a challenge to to uh prepare for in in the ... was the same thing he was just a great great impactful player so you know that that those guys are good but I can do is they just go back in history and I buy my history is back to the sixties\nOr with Penn State I Can't remember last time they don't have a good running back a guy that you really have to respect them if you don't tackle and defend them oh he's going to hurt you and those guys the same way\nAt Minnesota at Indiana convincing wins but more Iowa fans are than than home fans to be a little bit different here today at the same is really supported by the fan base with a hundred and ten thousand whatever have you talk to your kids about handling the environment the emotional\nYeah tried to explain the joys ... this morning that\nThis is just kind of like the Indiana trip and the you know it's a small town you know you'll end in in the airport and you know they send minute ride over the\nSo the only difference says there's gonna be hills trees and we get in a state of ... and be a lot of fans and they're not going to church for us so a little contrast there a sense of what we experience but you know all that being said I you know it's a great college environment just like Kenny isn't it if you really like college football you know you love being in those environments\nAnd it just adds to the challenge is always a challenge to play Penn State\nWas has been they've always had really good players are and when you come here that's always a great environment so to me if you if you really enjoy this it's it's just one more thing that just cut a revolution and take it out as a challenge\nYeah coach versus just like the Indiana trip except the Ninety nine percent of the people in this road stadium will be rooting for you or against you and that for you\nOr his point was Iowa

I always tied in ... and ... and is there versatility\nBut I think one of the things that's probably more challenging this year than in years past is when those two titans are on the field they can line up and a ... that\nThey go on up in it too tight end that or they can line up in um three wide receiver set a and this year they can line up and\nWhat we would term spreads that like a a poor wide receiver set but they're doing it out of twelve personnel so you know obviously as deep as a coordinated you like to be able to put people in categories at eleven personnel they do this at a twelve personnel they do this I was Twenty one personally do\nThey do this and that is challenging to do obviously based on on their guys\nNow added quarterback needs family and and improving run game at the ... present multiple defensive issues her parents would gladly take a repeat road performance like at Minnesota\nAnd Indiana thoughts of uh Penn State head coach James Franklin throughout the Iowa ... corn promotes honest hardworking values that are uniquely Iowans I'd be have ... states corn farmers we salute all fans and athletes for their hard work determination\nTo be the best both on and off the field I recorded by Saul fans to register to win prizes throughout the corn ... corn dot O.
