I've been all over the place in the state yeah wave at all of our guests might just so you know everybody we got the whole report and everything here in our hands so yeah\nWe'll be quiet and you are a ... no good to have you on the air I just hope I never have to be a Supreme Court now [laughter] [laughter]\nOh dear oh dear Mr Grinnell are ya I'm doing well yeah we're\nUh looking out over a tc of banks stadium which is going to be obviously as you guys know the site of a good border rival I mean this is\nAn interesting place to go first or have pulled off three upsets in this building against the Iowa hockey guys over the last nine or ten years and uh obviously they're hoping to try to pull off another one today coming in as a seven point underdog\nTell us a little bit about this Minnesota team hum as was mentioning a little earlier so speed on the edges and or a talented young quarterback\nYeah they're very young Mets I guess been the theme of the of the year for PJ Fleck the second year head coach a they have about sixty freshmen on the roster sixty five freshmen and thirty of them are on the too deep right now now\nI'm In fairness I think they have seven safety's lifted in six are freshmen now I'm just kidding but they do a lot of freshmen how many they have 'em and you're right they're receiving corps to the top three guys are freshmen or Richard freshman quarterback so true freshman\nUh and and uh you'll see a starter at cornerback as a true freshman today and um and they've been banged up I Know Gary mentioned that and you got your best player it off ants Rodney Smith and your best player on defense Antwon Winfield junior both out for the year and so more young people will be playing in their place\nSecond ear for PJ flak here after the first season and and where we are now the natives comfortable with where the programs that might uh it depends\nOn who you listen to it you know as you guys know it's a different tone in in the twin cities you have\nPro sports one you have two newspapers both competing for readers to all sports station both competing for listeners and now in the world of Twitter message boards and everything else um it's easy to be negative I think if if I\nObviously the die hard to like him he he has messages right his message is good uh is the thing that they take certain faith in is that he was able to quickly turn around western Michigan and you lead a team out of the ... into the cotton ball\nAnd go undefeated in that season so I think you drawn that and then there's a basis for some optimism\nUm and the one thing because of all that with the two newspapers to sports towns are pro sports town to sports stations you have a you know it's a cynical city it's it's a very cynical city and so when you're when you go about your business the way PJ like does and there's a lot of\nA model isn't a lot of scenes and roll the boat and all this stuff um you know I frankly think it would probably play better in a in a college town\nUm but in a big city where you've got columnist uh that that uh you know are are not scared to bring the machete out at times I think that it uh uh you know there's some cynicism with it there's no doubt about that I think that has probably surprised PJ like as much as anything is just\nIs on the road you've got traction you different environments different hotels everything a little different but they got to be returning to a game at this time to thirty or whatever it is to go there and if you'd like to go their trust each other and see what you\nDo what you do Justin do what you do that's football gig under under they're talking about the hot sitting out on the road for the first time ... and there was some talk about the crowd noise and about trying to take the\nCrowd out of it and it easily was also asked about that and uh it it says it's sort of an opposite view from feeding off the energy at home\nI have to embrace that ah that kind of mentality you gotta take when you're when you're playing it can it gets a ... feet off the energy they bring you in on your plan on the road or you go do the same thing but in the first kind of so Ah yes certainly that's a good feeling\nThere you go take joy in quieting the crowd [laughter] rather than entertaining\nThe mayor ... at least there's no chance of ripping down goalpost like a few years ago and trying to get them out of the dome member that don't gone yeah no mall and you only taking nothing out of us banks stadium now I'll tell you that when I play the New York well I mean if you tried to go get the goalpost outta there that thing is like sport not too sure about that yeah have you tried\nWell I've got a couple of people who can't be underwrite that\nHey by the way if you happen to be listening to us up there in Minnesota\nOr maybe you're on the way to the Hawkeye huddled going on now until two o'clock at the graduate hotel\nAre doing that live Hawkeye had all their so stay with us until twelve thirty than walk in and really get yourself amped up and ready to go a black and gold taken on number ruining gold as well and\nThere'll be um several black and gold and there are people dressed in black and gold supporting him money hooker who grew up just north of town\nA and that recruiting story is kind of interesting I was reading a little bit about that too where you and I are and I think it'd be North Dakota state jumped in early on him and then a a set Wallace was up there and happened to hear about um a heck of an athlete\nSo went over and saw a money and they visited for a while in his first question that the high school coach was how can Minnesota is not in on this\nAnd I guess the answer was well he's just not their style and so now turned out I offered hooker went over than a to ask Minnesota you guys going to step up and play down well we want you to come one more camp\nAnd so he did he went to the oh and by all accounts did really really well and afterwards okay you know you guys going to step up to ... well maybe we'd like to see\nYou again we want you to purify yourself in the waters of lake minute talk [laughter] number that from the rain and very abalone yeah and then we [laughter]\nWay find you a wind sparrow and find the weight of that and\nAll that stuff right so the coach into Monica look these well we'll we'll consider that um it wasn't really quite about saying that Iowa was the leading recruiter a took another visit to Iowa City committed to coach for instance I guess Minnesota tried to come in later into his credit he said hey you guys had your chance to\nGet around all day long on the side my future based on\nYour lack a commitment what's that look like for the future so\nI certainly doing great things have been given opportunity who said that pick six against a start the game against Ohio State a year ago and now we'll start at least for the first time in the backfield in front of his home town Minnesota golden golfers on their home

choose a kid captain for every game of the season it ties into the stepfamily children's hospitals mission and it's a great reminder as to why we turn and wave at the end of the first quarter today's kid captain from North English Iowa\nIn ... here's a bit of his story\nWe found in unresponsive and vomiting at the same time he appeared to not be breathing ties\nWe call nine one one [noise] so we brought him by ambulance to the hospital here and they ran a bunch of tests they said he probably did have a seizure and everyone is allowed to have one episode in their life and this year to be anything that was going to be a problem for\nEvery night and started having these apps\nAnd these seizures and turned out to be quite long seven to Fifteen minutes long so we came back here and we started to see neurology\nAnd they did a bunch of tests and yes he was having seizures but there was no evidence that reads and he was having seizures without neurology for a few years then after many medications and\nMixtures of medications nothing really seemed to be working we wear referred to neurosurgery they decided they would like to do an ... ... ... ... ...\n\nThe teams got together and they felt that they could\nDo a larger II section which is removing or just connecting a large section of the right side of his brain and their him his motor skills\nSo that he would still be able to walk and use his left side they had surgery and they removed the electrodes and he recovered in the hospital for about ten days and it was looking 'cause there was no seizure activity\nWe were home for about Seventeen Days and he started having seizures again except now they were not at night anymore\nHe was having daytime seizures um he was falling hitting his head\nIt was completely devastating for everyone including in and the doctors\nBut we just you know we didn't give up you can't give up you just have to keep going\nQuality of life would not be there without ... to me you also talked about us about through that which is\nCaused by seizures and in his really at risk me and my husband we felt\nLike I Am struck me maybe the answer in ... to me in January of two thousand Seventeen\nSo the damage in surgery he went in about seven o'clock in the morning I Believe he was gone for about nine to ten hours that day they had taught us that he would start out completely paralyzed on his left side he woke up and he was talking to us and\nHe was in the rest of it didn't matter because in was still there he had lost memory that was always a fear of ours so in ... he was in a wheelchair yet\nVery limited ... on his arm\nAnd he could take just a few stabbed in January of two thousand Eighteen in with one year seizure free\nToday and and walking jumping running\nHe

the loser college so uh never forget my roots that's for sure he gives they say you can take the boy out of Iowa or but the I was going to stay in the boy so this was always my favorite week Rob is you know to get the ... and now gophers on the same field and\nI'll get to see you guys and and and watch uh watch what I Hope to be a pretty good football game today and I'm really happy that it's not the last game of the regular season in November especially up here yeah especially now that the dome is no longer here right 'cause that was at least a a comfort I Know to a lot of Iowa fans who would drive up they would be All right well we can\nAt least be inside um earlier in the year is good it's a little chilly today but it's not like what it could be when when you get to November that's for sure\nNo doubt about that well this this year or two of the PJ flak erupt improvements Mike from year one year or two and then also what needs to continue to develop\nWell he is you know with with what he's about uh it\nIt's all about recruiting everything he does this catered to recruiting and so you can see from year one year to a ... an increase in the level of talent on the roster now is young talent and so you have to live with some mistakes the quarterback is a true freshman jak annexed dead um\nHad a pretty good start in the non conference and then on his first row start wasn't so good a plane or a higher level of competition and I think you know even if you're a senior\nYou know sometimes that can happen when when you're a freshman you're gonna have to live with some mistakes and so I still think that um you know just go for team is a is a few years away from where they they want to be I mean like I said you know obviously he wants to compete for the west division and\nGet the Indianapolis and you know if if you're talking about that kind of stuff then you can be you know a national uh you know figure in the national chase maybe at some point not every year I don't think that's realistic but on occasion\nI'm white Kirk has done like Wisconsin in this west division where have you um you know if you're good in that year and then you've got a chance to make some noise on a national level and I think like to let let's say today the golfers her seven point underdog they need some stuff to go their way or if they're going to pull the upset\nBut I think go for fans can at least see the talent levels upgraded he's got another good recruiting class already set to sign in December\nAnd then as that continues I think the goal will be hey when I ever comes to town if you play your game you can win it not quite there yet will it happen I don't know but I think there is some hope there you can say I mean you'll watch the freshman today and you'll see a make a mistake or two but then you'll watch this ... Bateman for example\nHe'll make a catch day you'll say yeah that kid is going to be all Big Ten someday\nYou talk about the talented aware is most of it well\nThey knew they needed to get better on the offensive line and so they're red shirt and some guys that are that I think gives them ... you know in the Big Ten particularly in this division when he got Iowa Wisconsin if you can't block you're not going to win and so\nUm they have some guys that there are the kind of bringing along there but the skill spots they need play makers um and and so they have gotten those\nUnfortunately they're best play maker on defense got injured he's out for the season\nAntwon Winfield junior he was just a sophomore of course that name familiar for\nVikings fans listening down in Iowa do recognize his dad ... field senior one of the great tackling quarterbacks ever\nUm and this kid was smart you could tell he was around the game I'm In three weeks of football this year he was Big Ten defensive player the week one week Big Ten special teams player of the week another\nUm as the old the game here against Fresno state which is unbelievable interception and now he's out a young guys out now younger people have to fill in for him but plain making I think ... that's one of the things one flight goes out and watch as he wants to see guys at when\nA for sure when they're on off into the ball's in their hand they can they can make positive things happen\nWe'll have more with my ... on the roundtable segment here on the pregame show more Hawkeye football from their field coming up on\nIs time for you or TV to have a [noise]\nOn Sunday night even if the legendary I heart radio music festival for the ... get the chance to catch the very best moments tune in for night one night the calculus Sunday at a central ...\nAlso on Sunday Madam Secretary returns for see the number five ten nine central on CBS Monday Night to the Iranians\nIt has to do with even more ... where the highlighting the final night in the history making show begins Monday at a time in central Honda cw\nTuesday night Carrie Underwood Malone Mariah Carey College of card Eby and hold the are among the schedule performers at the annual American music awards line at age seven central on ABC\nAlso on Tuesday to DC Comics inspired do a lot of the flash\nAnd black lightning are both back for a new season starting at age seven central on the cw\nAnd your TV tip off on my heart radio\nAnd your property with the state of the sprinkler system from elite fire sprinkler systems and Hiawatha\nThey offer custom designed installation and regular inspections of all their systems plus locally\nOwned and operated service from the pros twenty four seven\nNo one expects the fire but if it happens\nYou'll be glad there isn't a leak sprinkler system to protect you protecting people in property on line that belief fire sprinkler systems dot com\n[noise] those six twenty foundation and metro Harley Davidson would like to say thank\nHelping us donation looked at three hundred and sixty thousand\nTo the University of Iowa's family children's hospital over the last four years and this Thursday night six to nine PM at wild hog\nIt is the big jak residence agent from this year's fundraiser\nJoined us would metro Harley Davidson biker wild hogs smuggled point reject McVeigh on the outdoors days from six to nine plenty of food Goldrick come celebrate six to nine of wild hog\nThe he's Hawkeye radio six hundred W.

opt in there and that gets tilted to the side and and often they either lead with their shoulder had kind of it's\nAnd if you blow to the top of their shoulder they get a bit of a stretch into their

now you're going to do it and play a Big Ten game now one of the things we're going to see today is some freshmen action\nOn the part of the guys and on the part of Minnesota they they start freshman quarterback jak our next did a\nWho's only averaging a hundred and eighty seven yards per game passing so we're going to start today to freshmen corners Julius ... six too and he's from Indianapolis and Riley mosses six foot one eighty five from ... so obviously during the bi weekly that a chance but I Know there's\nThere's been some injuries at the corner and there's been I think\nUh some disappointment and some of the play source a chance for these guys to ah start today and also another newcomer a Barrington wait we'll start on the outside linebacker for nicknamed men who had an injury and it's going to be a real challenge for burying that he's a big guy I'm strong guy\nBut he's going to after court cover that slot receiver\nAnd that means if you have to a lot of running today so coaches Barry feels very good about it\nThe wide receivers Minnesota are pretty doggone good the freshmen shout Bateman these numbers Thirteen and he's got all the time and he's a porn star and um he's going to be a good one who still just press room but Tyler Johnson who's a junior\nA is really an accomplished wide receiver so are your own corners are going to be tested right away or they're only good part is freshman quarterback throwing up till now when you flip it over and the other side\nWhere are all fast versus ... says look at the last game Marilyn random ... thirty seven times for three hundred and fifty yards the only three fourteen passes um\nThat gave me all that kind of that's kind of game I think that Kurt first screams of do under the obvious thing is to be fifty fifty ripped passing and receiving that\nTheir line backers are passing and running in their line backers are probably the best part of their football team and we're gonna have to block them\nTo run the ball but I think when you take advantage of their secondary they beat up young secondary so I expect to see a good mixture of of running past\nAnd the best way to help out those youngsters in the Iowa secondary as for the defense of lie to keep doing what it's been doing\nWell I don't want to be standing in the pocket and when you were just um you know interviewing a\nMinnesota coach talking about his quarterback them somewhat restricted to run out of the pocket who don't you think that the defense is lying in bed ... looking at that on film no\nQuestion in two weeks ago at
