[noise] did you know that in two thousand Seventeen Dave Ramsey sound listeners fifty million dollars in debt that's pretty impressive good year this year listening for inspiration [noise]\nLet's face

job\nCorrect okay well\nThe good news is is the instant before they go in his shoe or you could file and they'd never get it on\nSo we're still nothing on fire ... ways away from having to worry about the issue you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at the job and find out you have that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in it might end up that and I would certainly understand with all but how you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing um because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny the tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things are very suddenly Rick\nItaly and out of ... out of almost a desperation and emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail now correct\nOkay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff naturally now how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars in a car\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't learn that yeah that's probably about ... three thousand guys\nThat is not bankrupt All right okay and do you have any IRS death\nNo just the um foreclosure on the house\nAnd kind and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\nOr do we start fresh ... but then it got sold in finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what it was okay\nIt's possible that they're not going to chase you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight\nYou're going to be okay\nIf I Am able to start paying off the debt [noise] um we do the best way to go from smaller steps to largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one of the subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar

it you're single center standing nearby yourself yes when my girlfriend's oh with your girlfriend aren't that works so what happened to Eighteen months ago that the phone rings and bury their answers the calling and God says wake up\nWhat happened well I saved up a little bit of money and I've paid off while paid on like ten credit cards and I thought I was doing a good thing and then the next month came around and I noticed that all of the ... the minimum payments were like ten dollars stupid and it was the previous month and I said this isn't the way to go\nSo from there I just started the searching around ways the payoff then and I actually saw the baby steps and then when I saw that I said\nI don't have time for baby steps I Need to get out of there tomorrow so I just kept looking around and then I saw um\nThe debt snowball maybe not clicked on the debt snowball and you're talking about the baby steps again so I said I Can't get away from this guy so I'm just watch it and then started listening to it and I actually went to one of your small conferences and rally oh yeah they're from there I was I've been on fire ever since then\nVery cool well done well done sir how's your field I have no payments Eighteen months later\nThis is a real it's real but a man who was well worth it was well worth so tell people when they asked\nMhm what do you tell people when they ask how you got out of that one of the keys to getting out of\nThat a lot of hard work hours every weekend for about a year and a half a ... or so from there and then to get my income up also started\nTo sell things I heard that you always talked about selling so many things that kids need their next I don't have any children themselves [laughter] I just started the sale everybody else and stuff so I Would go to yard sales and I would buy cheaper and then sell it for higher and I don't really have yeah I just kept doing that every weekend just view of mine come up and pay more than just to get it\nDone so where did you resell it ... I was on Amazon\nOkay jump on Amazon with used item and worked like anybody and goes out of there so what was the item that you did the best with reselling\nI was actually a board game um things called master piece of something like that I think I bought it for two dollars and ended up selling it for like a hundred and fifty woe is brand new sauce I liked is [laughter] with this alright\nAlright yeah I Want to do that again as long as I absolutely well good for you man very very well done what was the hardest part of getting out of debt for you\nThe hardest part um ... it wasn't necessarily to process it was more about seeing how that affected the people around me so you know they just affect society in general and I just made me\nWant to get out of the fast and then going to tell other people that you can get out of that and that you don't need to live that way so that was really the hardest part was just\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it is better plan\nIt was a good words those words telling me you'll never go back now now that this is the good life you know it's not my friend Rob ... let me see him every morning we worked together and he's that free too\nAnd uh we just talk about a good life is right now yeah Mm I meant well done so you brought your girlfriend whether you what's her name is Lauren and that's my mother deem All right\nSo you got the gang with your hair absolutely I've done the cheerleading shy or when you had to good cheer leaders ... anybody making fun of you are detractors along the way\nNo no not named detractors I mean I was at work so much there were no excuse me they would only people to sell 'em [laughter] I'll do the work of sleep and that was really I mean I just kept working and you know once you see going people can say what they want to say but at the end of the day and works and yeah you\nKnow I'm ... now now now\nHow do you like me now absolutely are we are well done sir very well and I'm proud of you know your mom is\nRight okay so if you came a you know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty\nActs thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but somewhere between one fifty and two hundred you could do it and about five years not counting getting raises and not counting saving even more\nThat's the most I Would want to go\nOkay I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that um but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay is that what you just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty page sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll\nGo ahead and recommended maybe\nIf we did you think it'd be it might be a good idea to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're going to go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment you you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you so much they create your vice\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call I'm\nSure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that to a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars in twelve month good for you and yes and I'm Down to just one dead\nWhich is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now ... ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been offended collections and we've been looking at our credit report just making sure that all these debts have fallen off\nAnd um it it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report\nAnd because of that my husband has been a ... with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now ball and just continuing the minimum payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYet that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just to mark what a bad mark because this was a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered you payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than seven thousand at this point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to\nPay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump sum of three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore\nBecause there's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again and on top of that you all the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA lot of thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for my tax shelter anyway [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took a annuity out my thinking was to take a lifetime monthly benefit [noise] mhm [noise] and so then when I went to I ask about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd they let him not really an income that should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [noise] I neither one way ticket another fixed and the lady with a nursing care on policy no\nOr another option but to take a tenure certainly what should be lower premiums and on your own life and then it went race could be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above them and uh so uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and gotcha is\nNotice I didn't even ask but I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call those bundling and there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest or prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value or down in value either one no no insurance on backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at the track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with its track record it's volatility as I was with your home as Seventy years old\nSomething like a growth in income fonder balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm us Seventy 'em and they wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart faster as Dave

hundred thousand of you do what's your opinion of buying a vacation home with cash and the renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with it all with cash and your debt free everything about that and your homes paid for everything else just by for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start building somewhere else but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nBirch preserve toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach are really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out\nBy the week I'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rental ... um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna you're gonna make usually enough to after you\nPay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kind of stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season where the ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset\nAnd some of your annual costs of you're awake\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not gonna be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the dollar per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or to build wind on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it is the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff we're not ... it wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nAnd we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the costs of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to be on a condo over in Knoxville in one of the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property the more crap you own the more ... more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory\nSo long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich from then you'll be fine Jamie
