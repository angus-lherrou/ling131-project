that's you know when our Josh I Know that your\nGross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that come up that that's the gross cash flow the difference no written the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy minus a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yet you know yeah fire five ... five or ... something like that I'm On a year from like them over our air raid I mean some years will be better than others and that time on a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things are my\nDutch um the uh uh in what your household income\n[noise] um so we bring about a hundred and ten gross to tell you what do you own your home our primary\nUm we just purchased sit on ten months ago and we owe to eighty and it's worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you had a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's thing to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on the right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on as soon as we got we have about ten thousand dollars left and and and got to get them in your ... um we combined probably twelve thousand 'cause we took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of Android after that though\nWe have any help now than ours like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I I was headed to end the call now because you're doing airplane and they know it's\nJust that the end of the year I'm always really tough and I feel you know environment\nSo it was just there in the event that um my condition that don't come through for the next three months [laughter] um I was afraid to liquidate it and that if I don't think an extreme on being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas that everything goes wild than I Would just write the check\nMhm okay ... okay uh uh\nUh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could swim pretty quick\nIf a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two of you I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThat's really the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five on and so Mike right one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know hardly making anything on that and you're in gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year ... money on the house if you're a three month vacancy market shopping up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is is an asset in your situation even though technically okay so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new gas\nIt's got a you know let's start working these baby steps the right way and following on through in getting the emergency fund on and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility that separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd build you some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred in my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I'm doing a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay All right and and they're on the island in\nThings like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah\nYeah well that you're you're just takes a little while to get things adjusted the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong\nBut more in there yeah but you always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I bet people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going you know there's just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nAnd really quick I wanted to ask why should I invested in the financial peace university um or should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you wanted to add on one of mine just give it to you and then we have to worry about it\nOh [laughter] okay All right now\nThat that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's one of your membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page mhm and then every dollar of my ... every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page I'm gonna spend X on food and why on utilities and the own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any left over money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done another one before and then this one is definitely the easiest is are\nThe Harlem the problem is as you're facing your realities that's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting\nAll soccer pictures and then I got this one mile down you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and it's got a few things that are fixed that are predictable and your rent or motors time but that's a fixed thing we know what that is that some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and it's and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusts and you'll get it man I Know and I'll have Kelly but God will get you signed up for financial [noise]\nThanks to Dr ... or ... or ... or associate producer I'm Dave Ramsey your host and\nWe'll be back in

even better check it out\n[noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their well being would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving\nFor education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things I had\nAnother debt\nPayment that means no credit card bills no student loans no car payments what if you never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless are overwhelmed from living paycheck to paycheck\n\nInto I'm trying to find a way to help them in a room and [noise] I'm trying to get a little bit short on knowledge\nAnd experience so what's the what's the problem [noise] [noise]\nWell the pollen is made out of taking it on the data's continued on to be be collector and attrition into he's pressured his daughter and and with All right you should be um but she's just not interested in and actually not interested in being responsible for\nA mentor they kinda older now and ... financial piece as well with her with them um but I don't know what the government you know\nHow she reacting now that she's in the clients\nWell she's reacting in Iraq and like she just kind of wanting to take it on\nOkay I'm there she have an income no she doesn't really have an income she's ... actually she does she's working part time um she married no she's not married okay\nWell her first goal is to take a ... girl\nTwenty five okay and why should not working fulltime\nI don't know apparently the degree that she always being video editing she hasn't been able to keep a job you're out of between her responsibility and it was bad decisions in her life\nOkay I I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat\nAnd mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay your bills or are they shocked\n\nYup yeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor\nTo sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they're both on this and that can play collector all he wants but let me tell you something about collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq\nThere was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know walking sharing work much\nRight yes her so she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on the student loan and if she has won two then what change do type watch five jobs and getting gear but that's going to be a shock to hurdles system\nBecause she didn't like it used to work and much\nYeah so I mean that so what we're doing is we're training her to be an adult and um but you you know dad is ... walking around with his chest puffed out like he like he can just yell at somebody and that makes them have money money she's broke because she didn't work so I'm Glad they got her in the\nClass so let's get her into let's tell her you need you treat her like she has a hundred thousand dollars in loan debt you twenty five years old so she does show her answer is you need to get six jobs live on beans and rice rice and beans live on a tight budget take into roommates sell so much stuff that the dog thinks she's next\nAnd you have no life ghetto cause you signed up for a hundred thousand dollars in debt get your budding gear go right that's what you would tell a single girl that was twenty five and your clash with a hundred thousand dollars in debt wouldn't you it's good\nOkay then I'll look at mom and dad and they're in my class\nAnd if I if somebody came in my class and said a day we signed up because we were stupid way co signed\nFor our daughter who doesn't work much and ah what are we going to buy this hundred thousand dollars in debt I'm going to go do you just bought yourself a hundred thousand dollars in debt and so I Would put that in your debt snowball and I would get my button gear and pay it off because you're an idiot you coach scientists\n'cause it says in the Bible you're a fool if your co signed for another\nAnd you may nicer than that but that's the message so uh you know both I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it and want 'em start working on the top of it and we'll see where they meet\nHere goes if she doesn't pay it they get to if they don't pay it she gets to\nThat is what ... only works are both on the stupid no so I treat them both like individual cases and let them start chewing on the top on them structuring on the bottom of the biggest fights and who gets there first so the middle\nEnglish from ... in the middle on this but I'd freedom most separately and then the as far as the in a personal
