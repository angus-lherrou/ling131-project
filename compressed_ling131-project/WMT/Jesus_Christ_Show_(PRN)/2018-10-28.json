fifty percent of your take on by or fifty percent\nYour income now you just cut your income down substantially one mama came home I got that part but still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much caught up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that
