I got a Nineteen sixty that those rebuilt from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... do four but dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a whole different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do with the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin how Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\nI'm kind of question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here come looking for\nBy um my wife and I have never made it through to you but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt as in about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it's you you know pay for some of those business expenses and during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see have for that what we have to kind of that money had the time um [noise]\nWe've closed out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover an anchor the hotel\nOr a guy who was and then you get it and get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're we hang it off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use it in\nThe ... the ... thing that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the ... one time with two thousand dollars in a separate new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you\nUse your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you\nBack mhm mhm is a little company you're taking a big risk sure yours or\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nThey may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they get right okay I can\nTell you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company that was ... they're going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing is Thirty years of seeing happen a lot of ... so\nThen where does that where does that fit and with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Would say I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollars right I don't ask\nMy people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on their eye on them now this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me to pay back [noise] we just\nPay for and we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit going\nWith ads gonna make ... going to make your stomach because now you're realizing there's real\nRisk there is this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day brand new show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on the

long did this take eight months [laughter] that's okay you know there's a story and your\nRange of income is about eight hundred grand okay [laughter] my goodness gracious [noise] All right so what in the world this was a ... bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us plus for us that we had a decent income to I'll do for a live with all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy and Tiffany\nI stay home and these two little lady Hossam ... okay\nAnd so um yeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I I listen to your show probably for about eight months leading up to this and you know for me is pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's best for other people and um I came to\nRealize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just listening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we sold a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but\nWe made it through and knocked it out and so excited my\nGoodness gracious so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nYou know obviously slaying it well done so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the hell spring what the springs\nSo the the uh the net all still lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nOkay but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off of the mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing about the four Seventy in order to reduce the yeah the other ... the\nCell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we showed about a hundred and twenty less than that okay All right\nAnd that's but that that are six hundred\nThousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay Joe ... show the a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this year I was done with the sale at least two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah one of all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge whenever we or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to a lake and how and mark caught me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one to four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go she'll radical yeah also and he did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity is all a lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nHe wasn't that way on one of those ...\nI was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Iran's eight or ... from the beginning I mean I'm\n... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ... what's your wired\nIt was really difficult to to give up something that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of oil down here they are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show them and we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nI'm Sorry it has a cash value in it right\nNow\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums are right now that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nExactly I was also or they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking it on and\nYou know it's hot sorry is my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which I like the candidate out policy that rates are low\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens to the rebels in dollars they're going to keep it now they got to keep\nIt so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either ... on the line and Los Angeles Hey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous ... thank you for taking my call sure what's up so um\nMy question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include the property taxes all modern association and the insurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away\nThe property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house or\nOkay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago in ... new numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but at the council twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinanced your hair long\nOne but that can ... if you've got to go to ... you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen and it will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest right but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand dollar\nIncome take home pay and and ... and a four thousand dollar house payment and wondering why they're broke you know Hitler the whole\nThe whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the er and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nBut if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house for that's all it is this kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "14"}
