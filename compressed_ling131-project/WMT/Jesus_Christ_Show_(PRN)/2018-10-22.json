move\n[laughter] no it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what our house has now because if we said it would be we would have to invest money into the house to do the upgrade um or we could move and that was great to have already been accomplished\nMhm or you could stay under the bridge or we can stay in the what not do the courage all we could stay in a kick up upgrades in it and save money and\nMove whisker right\nThere's no way I Would go back and I mean you've gone out in the first thing to do is go get house fever\nRight and that's after hearing up for it but that stream that you're just had on I thought I but I Know they are already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you said\nBut I I just I just couldn't go back once this hard to\nGet out I mean you you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia\nLet us not to buy a house that's where I worried how she was a matter of fact I'm\nWell above average square footage and you know stage in a great neighborhood by definition in the Roma market that's what the houses so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhen we worked our butts off to get out of debt and there's nothing will get us barking there's nothing I Want bad enough to go work a little bit\nAnd there's a lot of stuff I'd like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish the only the money to do but I'm like horses tips for even for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good\nWithout any pretty much so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just like me throw up think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments usually rupture money picks up the Algerian as you should do some a grudge or if you want them who ... you know shape hard for a couple of years\nYou probably save up to a degree in two years without any payments or if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out imposing riding around on a Sunday afternoon show this particular property well that one's going to be there\nOh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do I'm not going to be mad at you either way\nI just couldn't do it there's no way ... is with us in Canada Ariana how are you\nI think the days like I can call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him a long distance landlord by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who has my tenant by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place so it's currently sitting on the the entire complex that it and has gone down in value from my unit is we're Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm so therefore the units of the same style inland as mine and mine are the lowest\nPrice as like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday similarly and it came on the market five thousand less than me so one hundred Ninety five thousand\nI'm starting to feel a bit of urgency to sell because it's sitting in the winter is coming you know I was thinking of dropping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out over paid six months worth of condo feed her\nDoing all this with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket um after the market is discharge so my question is how\nWould you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\n... to ... obviously have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor yeah we in Ireland or I don't know what I'm going to do\nThat's the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm On a judge the future and say these things are going down in value there was already five of them on the market I've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good\nYou know so um when I drop it another fifty thousand oh no I wouldn't [noise] you know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but ... but five thousand out of pocket to be done with us two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty thousand dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worse and can't count on it and I'm going to pay if not a place here I live in the winter time\nWhen I but I mean not only just this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now exactly it's going the wrong way and so it's ... it's time to get out of\nTown you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you were panicking with the numbers you're giving me now you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand are probably going to wait the winter out you know\nMy put a tenant and wait on spring and see what happens but there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but ah but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm Sorry you're facing this\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five thanks for joining us Andrea is on

period of time to save up a big juicy fat down payment\nAnd if you can do that in a year and I think you can sounds like you've got this thing on the run you're out of debt you've got your emergency
