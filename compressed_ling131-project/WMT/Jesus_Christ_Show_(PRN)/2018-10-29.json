passed on years ago she Seventy eight them intermittent or hell has sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement fund and then about six thousand a checking account and\nThat retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay all around the house and he's basically been given or all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not his focus so it go it often goes without a tenant\nMumbling get steady money coming in\nAnd wondering you know if you have a recommendation on may be a better um consider an investment maybe a an event in pain or just the mutual fund or want to get your thoughts on her\nAnd her financial um situation as her net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets her Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with male so that three hundred two to three hundred a month if we'd been chipping away at our checking account\nOver the past few years not five pound only six thousand that's about to start hitting the fix the\nOkay the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah for about eight years silk I Know you've got that trash on that's invested in want\nIn my brother's one of my brothers rental property\nOut mom's money it's not in life\nAnd liquidated he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving her all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made and this rental property is not doing well because there's a lot being managed well correct okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis with me and you know\nIt's there and my brother it's in his home town but I was still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban and thought\nIt would be better off I'll sell the house and use the\nAnd he had to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um if it throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five she think that\nMore than our favor no I don't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks in the grip and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like that or I'd take a growth in income mutual fund and a balanced mutual fund\nPut about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just during the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation in to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month then\nAssuming you're sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses finality so they've been putting you know they don't work I was a financial advisor then your company is you're talking about your friday one K. and stuff okay All right yeah\nNot just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income than have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay so what we're saying is is that you know that there's this house is really poorly managed\nYoung don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in LA but the last year I think that it\nWill kind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um are checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drain or checking account\nBank that wouldn't be willing to give up the money for a nontraditional long because we were first time homebuyers on an unfinished house and I did find a bank that was willing to um we'd want to be an issue within five years and uh but it was appraised at two eighty um recently\nSo are they foster kids are adopted kids\nIn their adopted now they were\n... ... ... completion ... yeah what could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to sixty for it and you and you are what on it [noise]\nOne Seventy that's pretty tempting you know go rent something in clean this mess up\nMy my only concern with that is because of the many a night thinking about that is our kids we ... we have five kids coated with two biological and tree adopted our three adopt a kid all have to clear the Iraq of attachment just some very\nSerious mental stuff that they're working in fighting through and I I'm afraid that move and a shift up in their life again is this going to\nI'm afraid parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to clean up honored and forty eight thousand dollars where the stupid that's going to cause these kids' problems\nYeah that's kinda where where yeah\nI work a lot yeah I'll bet and you don't have a life\nAs this crap on Jew something's going to give you need to decide what's going to give or it's going to give without you deciding\nIt's going to blow up on your dude yeah so you didn't make the call I think you need to sell your house\nAnd I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change ... easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household\nAnd you never be in there yeah\nI'm no I'm no kid expert just raise three but ... and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and I get all of that on a I'm not trying to be on feeling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case\nThink you guys don't want to sell the house because part of killing the dream of the rehab but the house too emotionally and so I'm going to blame that on you and your wife I I I'm gone man I I'm\nJust how you're you're working on a house you're trying to run a business you got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you need to get a few things off your plate I mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work on\nAnd you didn't have any that we got rid of two of your three huge stressors here and I think girls quality of life will go way up\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid house there's houses on every corner you\nGet you know the house [laughter] but you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your shoes\nThey just decide which one you know and so\nThat's one thing you could do something to show her car or you saw a bunch of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options\nSo I I'm I I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on them and trying to help them turn their life around in in the middle of that that you you're just you're good people man\nYou're my kind of folk I like yeah I Wish I could just wave a wand and make this go away but if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids and the quality of life my family can him over the next five years and if I don't have this debt\nAnd I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of the day that all of the sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was ... ... um\nOh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what ... what hours I Am home I actually spend time with these children there stood out swinging a hammer when I'm at home\nUm I just think there's you you just put you put your Superman Cape a brother you're trying to Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all and I think they're showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think you ... do the right thing and you're trying to love your family will but um if I'm you I'm showing that houses just a stupid house you can get you know you get out of debt you get your business built up you bring up a big pile of cash you can buy you another house and two or three years\nAnd you know settling there and you're ... the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab while I have three kids with P. T. S. D. in my house that these things just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing I feel stressed out just talking to you about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what this shows about what I Would do so I can do whatever you want do your grownups but I'm a\n... who you're not gonna pay is not the answer who you're not you are going to pay mom and dad 'cause you're going to do that out of guilt and your company the Irish or they're going to come take stuff um you put the student loans on hardship for all you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nAnd it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in some attribution ... and if I can help you farther you call me back anytime Lewis's in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you\nGood how are you did better than I deserve what's up uh I'm\nTrying to

sound from a a an investment she's trying to a\nCash out of that she potentially will have about twenty five thousand dollars cash I looking at her budget I figure about twelve thousand wouldn't be a

Seventy thousand dollars in a four one K. mhm um I just got her set up and you are automatically draws ... ...\n... ... that thing out at sixty five hundred a year mhm so she's right now for ... she'll be investing Fifteen Percent of our ink on into retirement mhm um\nI projected with that with a Fifteen Percent out of it about ten percent to be a little conservative I figure she'll be at about eight hundred thousand or ...\nOn a force feed the first year off with some of it which I might go ahead and drop fifty five hundred on this year's raw\nUm or sixty five hundred which you can do at her age on this year's Roth out of it and then and then jump forward and start your structure withdrawals for the raw than for the first of the year that's probably what I Would do some of it and I'm probably throwing the rest of it at the house maybe step sick because you're doing for five six five done to fly\nThat's right where you are and um but you know you're right on the right track

R\nWell yeah ... like four months\nProbably like may or June\nOkay All right so like six months plus or minus All right um [noise]\nOkay it doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of pay an extra on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like metal yourself a letter that comes June first says if the house was not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\nOkay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf\nUm if you're going to keep the house but
