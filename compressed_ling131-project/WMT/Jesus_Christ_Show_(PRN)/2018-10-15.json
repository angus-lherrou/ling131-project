the ... it's not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what the interest rate is on the loan\nUnless her she writes\nRefinanced about two years ago and I would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to assume you could get a mortgage that was a very similar rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on him but we step three but it's going to take you a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're a hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year or more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions but this is not a bad\nThing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nAs you say no now she needs to just sell the house right\nOkay so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract to be obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we want a written contract that we're renting it for the

all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease\nIt with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance okay lease it for the payment with an option\nTo purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just show it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe I'm probably giving Iran a fish and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay\nPersonal finances personal\nAnd that doesn't mean it's situational a ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item you know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not someone that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway about

through with renters in\nMy if you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security ...\nI may or may not cause they're so scared a problem and may be passive income might not come up with Social Security be you might want to sell them anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate a good investment to

and the young folks you brought with you ... what are their names and I just\nWe got there and who is eight and Harper who's seven\nAll right good looking family very cool and all the way across the United states here to Nashville\nThrough your debt free scream you bet I love it how much will be paid off right about six nine thousand good for you and how long did that take close to nine months wow that's fast range of income right about a hundred and fifty thousand what are you guys do for a living so I'm In charge of management sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness coach\nOkay very good and what kind of that was the sixty nine thousand dollars\nA couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left cool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off car got us into the travel okay very\nCool but ... months ago some kind of a switch flip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right I'm going out and we decided to ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we won and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was the end where just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though they can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future ... so we just we ... intensity and your term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge father and podcasts lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problems\nWe started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church celebration center and so we uh got that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend it may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of things from what drew me to it because I Believe in modeling all behaviors and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children and having a future had model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris cotton taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out\nI mean oh my goodness you know it's happened much happened on this show can hear much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared

want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do whatever we do\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell they got a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies through the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally true\nOkay so I Do think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize
