{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "And a baby step one is a thousand dollar shave too is that free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fund of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five and six you do simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is maybe step for five is kids college doesn't apply here six is pay off I'll surely so that brings us into our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with a non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you right you got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that's non retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nOh that's correct and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um\n[noise] the uh the way I look at that is if\nYou owed thirty thousand bucks on your house would you go borrow\nFifty thousand to invested in stocks and bonds and my answer will quickly be no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before and uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect\nAs if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nDesigned by the way if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses it you know twenty three thousand or twenty two thousand or whatever was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty with a ten thousand dollar emergency funds\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what something else worth\nA it's on there were about a hundred and ...\n... ... ... only ... years old with a ... four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nIt'd be pretty nice\nYou know and then take and then you take that old payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and you use that the fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what else will happen is the ... you remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah kind it started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when did the original deal the first time and you went from debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on the oh that\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years and ... yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about ... because there's more going on here than simple math there's complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the lender that's the way you felt Thirty years I Can't stand as I got to get rid of this well the same thing will happen in reverse but on the positive side of hey when you don't have\nAny yet no\nNothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do your\nThe best thing that changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both that both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than in the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take you five years this time I'm much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean you mathematically relation Lee spiritually emotionally\nWhen you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would cash out the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten\nOr that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget and cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months or whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up that emergency fund a little bit fine but then kick those investments in the bud get them going again and you will prosper\nYou are on your way sir it's an honor to talk to you very very well done\nWine is an Indianapolis Hi Wayne welcome to the ... Ramsey show\nThanks day and I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work you do it certainly made a difference in my life\nWell thank you I'm the only help today\nWell my wife and I have been a leading the life of ... for about two years now and uh we've pretty much become that for other than our student loans or you're working on and then ah we ended up getting a now I got pregnant with her first child\nAnd a April so we take\nYour advice and a stop putting everything toward their debt snowball and started a bank you know all of that is good and ah as a ... month we we now have enough for her to take her three month maternity leave I'm paying for you for us which is great\nAnd that but the problem that the Murphy has decided to strike or a last week we got a bill in the mail from our city here and they replaced and sidewalks here on our lots and or the bills for forty four hundred dollars and a\nA baby on the way here and another a few months we don't have that kind of money in our cash flow to pay that off and twelve months before they put a lean on at home so my question is uh what would you do that in that situation that we we ... our maternity leave fun and pay that off or what do we do\nWhen somebody do\nA better in the beginning of December\nOkay well the game plan that will usually outline for folks is push paws on your total money make over your debt snowball so by becomes pile up the cash when baby comes push play again and take all that cash and throw it at your that\nIraq\nAs long as my mom will come home and everybody is cool but the cash is just to make sure everybody's school there's no issues and we're not it's not really for maternity leave unless you have\nTo have it to eat with but I mean it's not um it it it so that we can use or sell how much cash every got piled up or will you have piled up by the hour what\nSeventy five hundred dollars this month and like I said she is knowing that she's wanting to take the three months off the bond with the baby on such and we can't do it on my income alone so um that's why we were smart about this and it's at that\nGold and make sure that you know so we are and you got it from now until December to continue to save right correct and what other debts do you have in your debt snowball how much [noise] um [noise] just about a hundred and fifty dollars a month as well we have that in fact um other than our car payment on that you have you have ... that balances you need to play off\nTime no not on your car you getting much you owe on your ...\nOn on on and on dollars you know got well then the four thousand would be your ... says you play it all out of this guy and then we are to set aside enough for her to things and every month so you have the cash use it\nHey guys this

struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to the sand or insurance dot com recall

can get the title and that's going to leave you and her\n... is going to leave her seven thousand dollars and the whole if you want to help with that you can um we're I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid I Would ask\nYou to split it ... that\nShe each thirty five hundred and thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction however sign a power of attorney over to you for the the title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um how how her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and

eight to five five two to five Jill is with us in Phoenix Hi Jill how are you [noise]\nHi there thanks for taking my call and when I was here for a while\n[laughter] I I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had family his wife had died and he had three small boys to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title alone in her car a road rubber check credit card debt to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be here with me right now and how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of last year\nShe almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her death [noise]\nUm what does she said in these collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nAnd now she's still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nIf kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight there in Arizona gave myself and my husband the responsibility of taking care of the baby now we can go wherever Sean baby stays with uh\nOkay so now moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the mother correct okay good\nGood that's good news okay so here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing\nAnd she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof Oh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants and that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking you know she want to thank you know her boyfriend had said to me well I didn't make lead find anything that she wasn't aware of Michael but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that and the second book let's assume that debt is valid for us it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her\nTo work our way through it when she gets back on her feet well\nShe might even got a job right now I Know I Know yeah I Know\nWhat I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we worked with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes to church\nWith offer him in the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me they shouldn't get pregnant armies mad because she'd on to ferment every day so she's been from the\nBottom line is ringing I'm line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a\n... but it can happen it can I ask what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know\nOf of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was given trucks you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I\nWhole life companies don't sell treat term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander ... last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll\nLose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself and so there's no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it Irish you're going to be under grant gap no matter what you know but I didn't know there are certain steps now that if I did take I Would leave out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever they're\nNo there's no difference at all all you do as you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed extra expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value watched the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow Walker nor your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancel on a credit card you got to argue with them to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to ... get them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I think um I went up and down probably seven months ago on ... on a really challenging time they actually have a child was in college that can you hear that we need to pay for and that's how I have Harry Carey expected to a candidate extent isn't like that they can hide it and not ...\nI'm I'm going to try to figure out in the\nHat and before that you have to be fair came to town on or taking out a stair while I'm Sorry that I get something to make sure that we're going to ... I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work and it was really pretty devastating to watch that just fine\nI'm Sorry you did that the the tree last year job that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nIf you're\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got there so ... you're in the middle of a storm we get a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm coming up more total we're going to have to pay twenty three by coming out here I'd have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have a Belgian way there okay\nWell I mean it it might be if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and by his eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\nIf\nYou have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout ... and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband might be okay and what did you used to do 'em in software support\nAnd how long have you been laid off on a down side of not wow not but in Valencia an award", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "07"}
