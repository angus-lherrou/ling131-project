through difficult moments some of it's gonna be hormonal\nAnd to better understand it is critical so you're not freaking out the mom and dad saying oh my goodness we have an ax murder you know this is our specific person out there that would not be a good idea but it's\nBeing mindful of it and taking the long view and understanding where you're at I'm David let's go to the the boy maybe that little boy\nAnd they're expressing a blame or avoidance or deny all kinds of stumbling blocks for that little boy when it comes to resourcefulness what is resourcefulness and what are the stumbling blocks look like\nResourcefulness is really taking the emotion to something constructive it's problem solving strategizing it's critical thinking and it's kind of part of that to part agenda we talked about earlier figuring out what do I feel and what to do with it it's a what to do with that part and\nAnd boys I Love helping boys developing this area because I think again as males were kind of natural problem solver so this is flexing a little stronger muscle but the three someone block she mentioned are kind of his biggest road blocks of blame avoidance and to not have that acronym of bad\nIn the book because I think boys do a lot of in the face of failure in the face of you know difficulty swinging between blame and self hatred somewhere between\nIt's your fault and I'm an idiot and they have a hard time getting to that good healthy middle space like I had a conversation with an eleven year old boy just yesterday in my office\nAnd he struck out three times in the same baseball game and he was talking his way through it and the things I heard from him where those two extremes like the pitcher couldn't even throw the ball they're flying\nAnd then he got to at some point in teary moment on the worst player on the team but nowhere in the middle was the sense of\nI had an off day Ramis practice one day this week and I was a little bit you know not as in my in my read them like they were all these different factors that I had to lead into that he just couldn't get too easily on his own and so I think as long as the boys swinging between those two places it's really hard for him to develop\nHow how does a mom or dad minimize that pendulum effect how do you narrow that in what can you say that will help them coke better and equip them so I\nI Do think that empathy and questions formula is really useful in these moments of that sounds hard sometimes when when they're stuck in blame it's tell me what you think your part was in it what was your contribution or we laugh I have a story at the beginning of that chapter about one my sons were six and\nThis is an example of how early it starts with boys we had a soccer game or run around the house on a Saturday morning and my son walked up to my wife and said what did you do with my soccer cleats\nLike nothing's thought to say did you see where I left and you have any idea where I put them and so in those moments rather than just again coddling like I'm going to go to finding them for him you know my wife with him and said\nI didn't wear them I didn't wear those with not black skirt she was all playful for a moment like where did you leave him last like helping him move towards some problem solving on his own as opposed to doing it for him but not letting them stay stuck in blind\nAt that is really helpful I'm I'm thinking of that just in my own parents in my own father and those are good things to come back around on and when you notice them not doing as well as those empathetic questions I like that I'm Suzie how about for the girls when it comes to resourcefulness what's their stumbling block and what's the building blocks for them\nI think girls for any of us when we come up to read block resourcefulness is really working our way around it and I have more and more girls who just sit down by the red blocks among plant flowers and let him drop the airbag getting around it and\nWhy is it important right now and\nYeah and so motivation is one of the building blocks that we talk a lot about and I think sometimes were imposing our motivation on them rather than helping them find their ... and so we keep going back to empathy and questions but I think even in those times when the questions I asked them most at my counseling offices what do you want\nWhat do you want to happen here what do you think again is what do you think's going to help\nI Want to end with this question and for each of you to answer this because I think um you know you're doing counseling you have the techniques of counseling a these are things that we believe as Christians are are rooted in biblical truth I think we can all agree to that\nWhy do you think God does it this way I mean when you look at the uh little years of trying to teach them and then those hormonal adolescent years and then puberty hits and you've got the teen years when you're looking at the big picture\nWhat just got one from us as a parent as a father David and as a mother Cissy\n... I Would say I think what he wants most\nFor me as a father is a to B transformed more into the image of a son and he was going to use these beings to disrupt me take me to the end of myself and help me figure out I'm making more of a mess and I'm\nDoing it well and a lot of moments and that there's grace for that and we talk about this and spiritual milestones of just\nHow we cannot really understand the beauty of grace unless we understand the depths of our neat and so I think that's more what it's about for me more than anything\nIn that mob space the mom that's to her wits and she's so worried she's not in control of the things we've talked about this last couple of days those um [noise] maybe you might call them the sensitive spots for eve [laughter] you know where he lives those\nTributes that so many women so many moms possess how does she wrestle herself away from that and actually trust God even met some really serious stuff ...\nLet's say a lot of dependence I'm just like David talked about and and that one of the things asset with moms and talk about all the time is God gave you exactly what you need all ready for the life of each of your cats even the one that's in that's challenging and that child\nReally in effect will be the ... ... ... and will teach you your knee for Jesus and his ... for you so that you in turn can spell it over to them against that so much of what we do when we left cats\nBoys so good and you have done a wonderful job in this book are my kids on track the twelve emotional social\nAnd spiritual milestones your child needs to reach I mean so many parents contacting us here focus on the family saying am I doing the right job this is one of those resources these tools that can really enlightened you as to whether you are and I love what I've heard David and Suzie thank you so much\nFor being here are with us we appreciate thank you for having us we loved it and listen this is why focus on the family is here and we want to provide you with debacle answers and trusted advice as you're raising your children are that's what we want as we're raising ours\nUh we have many many resources available to like our seven traits of effect of parenting assessment tool which really reveals your individual parenting strengths and those things you can work on\nIts worth doing just for that reason we also have a feeling ... chart with our loved adventures and all the characters and David insist these book that we talked about today are my kids on track\nThe strength of your family is important to us we pray for you and to continue to provide these tools we need your prayer in a financial support to be blunt especially as we're closing out our fiscal year we need to know how to budget for the coming year\nWe our listener supported you're the one who empowers us to take a stand for the family and deliver hopefully good solid encouragement and council\nWon't you do your ministry I like seeing it this way do your ministries through the mechanism here focus on the family by contributing to the work here to gather we will reach people for Christ and when you give any amount today as our way of saying thank you will send\nA copy of the book we talked about\nAre my kids on track donate and get your copy of the great book had focused on the family dot com slash radio or call us and we'd be happy to tell you more eight hundred delivered a and the word family\n\nOne thousand dollar hey thousand bucks can't beat that every now and then they go on vacation I have allergies and others on housing to jam\nListening for the next chance of landing anyway\nJust listen to win one thousand dollars every hour days from five AM to nine PM right after the ... hour news\nHour by liberty safely Cedar Rapids and their new location forty nine fifty Johnston avenue northwest in Cedar Rapids brand in your hand is on news radio six hundred\nW.

University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine the other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nOr no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I\nPrepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're\nNot giving you an interest rate they're not giving a growth rate you simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stock mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government\nAre very poorly run\nAnd they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process\nI mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other\nReason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for for a a ... I was going to refuse for the last seven years and we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good\nFor him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing and it's fixing to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money mhm\nUh over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want him out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed\nProperly mhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there is only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling right now all prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by you know what I mean but er and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what its it's essentially a they're looking at a three million for all the and a or you know obviously one point five for half\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day\nBut you're not gonna you're gonna make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage him and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season with a ski house or your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your boy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know runners and you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there is a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff we're not\nLike he wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broken English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nAnd we put it this way for Sharon Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that yeah that's a price you pay to rent it out and all of that to say it's not an ideal\nInvestment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out\nAnd um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy\nInterest a toy that happens to go up in value and both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in the you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to be on a condo over in Knoxville in one of the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more ... more repair them and you have to know [laughter]\nIt just goes with the territory so long as you can handle that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine Jamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHow they how you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your life\nAt the end of August I have a friend who has been following Ewing information and I had been struggling at the single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march and I and I'm like I make enough income but\nIt's like I don't have any money left over to Tim Morrow street I put gas in my car and I work a pretty good ways away from home and I have two boys one in school and very active and\nThen he adds a lot of things going on as well [noise] it's just [noise] everything that I pay my thing I I don't miss my hat and\nKristen my income at three everything is getting out and\nGot you know I'm not sure that your house payment for rent okay and how much is your car payment to Ninety two a month okay I'm not sure on their car have less so\nThat's not bad but your your take home pay three thousand is thirty six thousand a year so that means you probably making about forty five thousand before taxes that sound right\nAt each paycheck is a thousand in something so for the month with a twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about two and half white fellow that three thousand yeah total income\nOr a little over three okay uh well you don't have a lot of wiggle room here raising two boys um now but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat\nThat means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget\nWhere every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins and you assign every dollar\nAnd so we would start with Todd off the top you said you're either med school and that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tide is done now are we going to next well we're\nGoing to eat so second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights in your water okay now what's the next thing you do you do you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay he probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give or take right\nI don't know what you want to know the only man that much left over food um but you know you've probably got twelve hundred maybe not let's just call it a thousand you know after you just your run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus ... minus ... my my uh food bit budget what am I set up for food\nAnd a minus ... minus my lights and water now I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else oh now we've got by a car payment or they're going to report that\nThing and we've got to put gas in the car now how much is left only then that we spend money on something else\nBut you can't go buy something for your son's sporting event and then not be able to pay your light bill right that's not an option how long you been a single mom\n[noise] um [noise] they're
