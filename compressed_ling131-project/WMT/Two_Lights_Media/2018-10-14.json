{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Now that's not what most wise want but I think that's where you go to your girlfriends and your sister and your mom or even your daughter to get that but your husband is expressing concern by trying to fix the problem now for the men listening here's what I found to deal with this divide\nI've learned because this is what expresses concern to my wife when she expresses something that's really bothering her\nThat's not the moment for me to fix it that's the moment for me to say now I'm Sorry and to draw her out and then that oh yeah I see that and and to be curious she\nFeels loved when I show empathy and more curiosity not stop talking it's usually tell me more but then I come back later in the day at least two hours I've been thinking about this I've been praying about it what if we did this\nThen she just seems more willing to receive it because she felt\nHeard but what I Want to hear is is because I Know a lot of why sometimes you feel this with your son's\nYeah you have an adolescent son and he's hurting and you want to smothering him you want to hug him or kiss him and he pushes you away\nAnd you know how that hurts because you're thinking of want to show you I care and he won't let you care why doesn't you love or money yeah that's how she interpreted why doesn't he loved me [noise] that's exactly how your husband feels when he's trying to stop your pain and you resent him for it\nHe feels like he's given you a hug it's his neurological form of a hug and you're rejecting it you don't want your husband\nTo feel bad for wanting to show up the heat is showing empathy he's just showing it in a different way so for the men listening let's learn to show empathy and curiosity and for the women listening\nBut don't discount the male version of showing empathy if we would just understand the way our brains work instead of resenting each other we can work toward each other God made his compliments I'm Glad the world has both forms of brain\nWe want the people who say I really care that you're hurting but I'm thankful for the people that says yeah but I can fix that [laughter] you know ...\nThe one where you've got going right now she's coaching me on this it's my ability to finish her sentence on fixing the end of ... because she'll say you know the other day with her and she'll go into a story and then she'll struggle for that word also to do this\nTo do that [laughter] she probably would have been said let me finish my son [laughter] it is a struggle for me that's my fix it mentality let me just move faster let me move it along\nWe are so similar [laughter] I'm picking one of the scripts I have running these days is just be quiet don't ask anything just let her process because Dina likes to just throw it all out there and talk and I get lost sometimes ... it has been helpful for her to know\nThat if you'll just shorten things up or let me just pared back to you what I think you're saying it's so much more beneficial to the both of us but it's hard work on both parties to understand that's how he's wired that's how she's word\nYeah and to respect God's\nDesign that we just the natural human tendency is if somebody is different we think they're worse we look down on the different because men are different than women women fault men for being different when you think about it put it in a medical procedure if you're going in for a medical procedure you want one person with great bedside manners\nBoy this must be painful yeah we're going to be there everything's going to be okay don't worry\nBut when it comes to the surgeon\nI I don't care if he or she even talks to me and my son had surgery which is brilliant surgeon it was this\nAsian woman he had to have is Han worked on she goes here's my first thing if this works this is what I Want to do if that doesn't work I'm going to do this and here's the third thing but this is the first I thought man I'm so glad she's working on my son and she got a gun I just want competence I Want somebody to fix his hand\nAfter he's done he want somebody to say can I get your ice how are you know patting him on the shoulder I'm Glad they're both kinds of people in the world and so\nMarriage is about that men are different than women and that's by God's design\nGary said this but we sometimes it's a I don't mean this disrespectful way but it can be a bit of a throwaway comment that of course men need to learn to listen to the ... what does that look like practically for us how do we how do we stop trying to fix it and how do we lean in and and really do that what's the\nTeaching for us here look I I feel like a bit of a hypocrite because we're on three decades over three decades into my marriage and I'm Still really trying to learn it I think I'm getting a little bit better but for me\nI have to learn not to go with my natural reaction when you get the urge back I says okay this isn't the time to solve it I'm going to try to you if somebody is bothering her something's happening but it's first okay I when I found ... tell me more curiosity expresses love to my\nTo my wife and I I'm Pam feral really helped me understand this how or why still loved when we're more curious and that that just that one word just say okay Gary be curious ... isn't that what makes a woman feel so loved when she's dating\nReally tell me what happened there more to add on and so I just found from my wife to feel cherish I I Want to be curious I I Want to draw a route instead of Jimmy the Reader's Digest version I Want to make time for the amplified version so I can really hear if I ask more questions\nOn it but even then I had to learn now why does that hurt you I think I'd be curious if she thinks that's a challenge so it's really learning to read your wife and just say lord helped me with my words to show that I really care about this and I really\nFeel for Gary you've said it and I hope the program the last couple of days has been helpful\nParticularly for those wives who have struggled and who have felt they they're in marriages that are isolated they they feel like they're ... they're not going anywhere maybe they've already um since that resentment that bitterness taking them over emotionally\nUh this is for you and we're here for you to focus on the family\nAnd we have a great counseling department they can kinda get that discussion going confidentially don't need to worry about that we also have an intensive marriage program called hope are stored if you're in greater difficulty is Gary has described\nA would there are many resources and tools here focus on the family for you and I want to make sure that you're aware of that not

help so don't hold back\nWe are equipped to help you and I hope you'll do it take advantage of it\nYeah you can get in touch and learn more about how we might be able to help regardless of the

the website is focused on the family dot com slash broadcast\nIt Gary before we say goodbye yeah we've talked about the importance of prayer for your husband or making sure that your rooted in God's word let's end with the scripture\nOr for that wife who is struggling what can she hold onto today to begin her journey with her husband and loving him\nIt's a familiar averse gym but I think it will change the way we look at our marriage flipping for Nineteen says my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory\nIn Christ Jesus my God will meet\nAll your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus we'd go to God's first to receive we go to our spouse primarily to give that doesn't mean there aren't legitimate things we want to receive from her husband but it starts with receiving first from God as well say you're a great to have you\n\nGuys fans news radio six hundred W empty and Gore's light invite you to play our score predicting content register

[noise]\nThank you for joining us some air land or open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Diane is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it well a line of credit is an approved\nAlone that you take out only when you would want to\nGet pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we tried to get the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one once you get ready first mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of\nThat because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money the bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and\nBar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point is going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um the larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nUh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know I can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey thanks for taking my call Sherman what's up\nI'm standing on a high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I invest in China then\nYou're going to college\nYeah community college with an a plus for entertainment and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep program at the community colleges is either and you know our first yeah yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that okay so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be and I am or whatever\nMhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it or\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\n... field of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study\nWhether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than broaden the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago and Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take on\nOkay very good and what kind of debt was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just stayed I'm off from the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right um other one was going out and we decided to baton for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we won and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was the and we're just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we could pay it no problem it was just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we won ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following podcasts lotta time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church and celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about the time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we got a few we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's the ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's a very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drew me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and if I'm gonna model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Morris caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean all Margot knows you know it's often much happened on the show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nThey show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be dead for a one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars in nine months\nWe did not do it yeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell they've got a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWhat drew generally true\nOkay so I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it so to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it hits why but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\nOkay go what was your why right here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy and lumber leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change likely have to start teaching at Mm\nModeling it in teaching it yeah I haven't changed your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know which if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along the lawyer for some people that kind of went yeah then you'd be more nuts\nYou know we have ah we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have something to try to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that were definitely coaching on keeping us going not only through our you know scenario but also helping us lead a few so definitely\nMhm when that's when he came home that first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me and listen to this podcast I Want to do something different where you resist under judicial I Will finally you woke up\n[laughter] I Know I had a pet in my stomach when we bought a car ... and so and like intuition Lee I knew that was not the right choice but we kind of felt that pull that we needed to do it or he played your podcast on a date night at the typically remember that date night [laughter]\nThat is so on romance [laughter]\nHim [laughter] we we listen to that five cats and I um I was really getting on board and about the same time Rachel's book had come out that later life\nUm and I was listening to that an audible dot com and just really think think pieces are coming together and I I Know the lord lead you in the direction of where you need to go ... do we just um I got on board after that but\nI told him the hardest part of this process for me was getting excited about his spreadsheets he would email me once a month and I think the email\nOh how exciting yeah Mr podcast on a date night minister spreadsheet this guy he's [laughter] those guys my kind of\nWhole nother an array of love and very well done your\nGuy that's fun that's very real stuff well congratulations you guys\nYou guys want to share one thing real quick day so I mean I
