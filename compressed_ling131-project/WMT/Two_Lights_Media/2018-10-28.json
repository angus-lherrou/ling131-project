I can find your plan for on has like a couple of months now I had the emergency fines and I'm working on baby steps too good on that night and I had made progress not a ton of rock I asked\nMy issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work full time and not letting it take all my life is good and my question is is how do I buy jet arm for my deductible\nAnd it ended up recently I recently switched ... festival started again I\nAlso have a chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's nothing on the go it it it's not to do it and it's not life threatening\nAre you going to double every year\nNow okay so now I Would also they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's an air tanker commissioned by the doctors are unsure of war comes from okay God and so it was over there but I Do is really sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nBut what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've dubbed battled with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand\nDollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nWhatever a line in your budget for medical expense ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while and that someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I literally like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been doing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really are likely to right now\nOn what I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere our identity that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that I made I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition access which type job I had more flexibility\nOn some of the fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm when I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred to Fifteen hundred a paycheck on\nAnd you get twice a month and\nYou get twice a month okay and you said you're living with them I guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot\nUm\nAnd I do get some help from family\nAnd what is the nature of the student loan debt is everything credit cards all also because they can have it I was trying lot of holistic things and it's not at all and then it's student loan as most of it it's like a check it out of it so I had like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food pantry\nNot eating not eating out for it and you're paying more than half your life on your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shoulder clothing and transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as far out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for this\nMedical expenses or they're going to be new debt right because they are coming [laughter] you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying right actually I've got ... how to prepare for it you're saving coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term we gotta get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\nDoing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step to right now I'm at that we just paid off our second credit card today that we are down the credit card and moving on the line\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working on that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[laughter]\nOkay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf um if you're going to keep the house but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be ... sixty nine thousand currently in a savings account so say we don't sell the house how much of that Americans have on would you put towards the mortgage\nField emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are that high ... you know okay so what would it take if you lost both of your jobs or what would it take for you ought to pay your bills for a month\nFor a long mhm um eat keep a line going ahead what do you keep the lights on that kind of stuff\nI'd say three to four thousand\nKind so a three to six times times four thousand six times four thousand twenty four thousand she'll twenty five thousand of the sixty nine is the most you should do\nOkay which leaves you about forty clear okay for a forty five clear um and uh to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eight thousand okay yeah so hold that and and I had to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand dollar count in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house fund or paid off ... bond\nOkay you know if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house\nOkay if you awful and change directions in your decision which are allowed to do you're an adult by the way our way money is a winner who who's up okay Monica is up well who's up just just make up your mind I don't care [laughter]\nI don't get the signals from the booth that um we can't repeat okay boy [laughter] in San Antonio [laughter] hey Wyoming what's up [noise] how's it going to have better [laughter] I deserve [laughter] that's for sure how can I help\nUm no I was just calling in today 'cause I I've been listening to for about a year on and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand and cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars yes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one's twenty year what did you use to the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... deal is my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose a house his soul ticks listings and expanding called the by the end of the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one who makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one dollars that\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n'cause that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for rich or poor in sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it's you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you know that cancer thing there by yourself and those ... you get to do that by yourself you don't go do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nOne were married in ... in the Senate health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we need my my truck is for sale already have it on the market good on that soon as I as soon as I Do some of these calls means of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what it was like oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what is called the ... and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash in and she sells her car and then what have at least one car\n[noise] right now well I don't\nKnow I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the layoff in or the firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income that used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the second week of November everything should be coastal signatures\nTwo guys three weeks from the year I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would do I would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's your if your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that so uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money but then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but it's still has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but\nIf you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then you're not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you ever marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you and I started showing mama's car is not what a good way to get ... boring\nYellow so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like you're in you're going to go\nBut if it got and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our car group and you get are cheap car to drive you drive a car while we get this ...\nLives as Ramsey show\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution\nThey've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for\nNine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine exit or timeshare ... team dot com [laughter]\n... you know ... ... fifty two percent of Americans have less than ten thousand dollars saved for retirement if you're in that majority retirement may sound like a hopeless situation but it doesn't have to be my name is ...\nAnd I want to help you ... your dream retirement [noise] we have to stop thinking that retirement begins with some magical age like sixty five or Seventy\nRetirement begins when you have enough money to enjoy the lifestyle you dream about\nIt's going to take more than a dream do\nHave to get serious about making a plan I created an assessment tool to help you know what you need to do to reach your dream return get your three assessment at ... dot com\nWhat are your goal is to live comfortably traveled the world", "show_name": "Two Lights Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "28"}
