I got a Nineteen sixty vet that's rebuilt from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to four but dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kind of stuff and move into a whole different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that but um but I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin how Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\nSo I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here come looking for someone by\nUm my wife and I have never been through to you but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt as in about two and a half weeks ago great congratulations thank you um\nI work from home with a relatively smaller come\nOkay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it's you you know have for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see pays for that what we have to kind of that money I had the time um we'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been for much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover and hang out how I got ... and then you get it and get the money back then\nYou get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're ... we hang that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... what does that you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back a little company you're taking a big risk sure you're\nYou're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary\nAt some point they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they get right okay I can\nTell you they pay your company and then your company pays you write write air company Ellsberg there going to take that money from that other company and pay their bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I bet it is Thirty years of sand happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would never do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty companies I guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollars right\nI don't ask my people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person this trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on their eye on them you know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when\nThey travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for it and we\nPay back\nWe just pay for and we give them a debit card and we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to fund it with cash build up their cars and do away with a credit card\nIs that gonna make yet how that's going to make your stomach but has now you're realizing there's real risk there is this is the rams Asia [noise]\nMm\n[noise] Mm\nHey guys this is Jamie child

before\nI could if I really mean than to it maybe you're here every three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television shut down the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty dollars a year we got for paid for rentals but we want to act like we're broke people\nPoured all along with this rental for two years is the shrimp are worth up to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or going to pay no horn\nWe want to sell it but I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rental ... if the best way to do it is to live to free the nationally live debt free yeah stop it\nYeah you got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah\nSo um you know decide because I think you were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and borrow money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nThat's what it sounds like but now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much I you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get by to ready to buy a rental you pay cash for it regardless of what you do with this rental\nBut I Would do one of the others that's what I Would do so Hi
