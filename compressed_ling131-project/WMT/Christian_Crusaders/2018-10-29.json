I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I Do not talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that would eat up for it but it wouldn't really wouldn't I mean you to get to forty grand if you got you know the doctor will co pay it and that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so it'd be very and I think you're okay forty grim\n\nAnd if you declare that than we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process in this with you because I'm trying to figure out what to do it\n[noise] okay um\nAnd if you want a super emergency upon backup light or you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated or a principal process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better those aren't logical to you I think so yeah I think so\nHave you got a good friends or family or past or somebody else when you walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this in a rational what I've been told that don't have to worry about it but I Am\n[laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying\nNot necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know\nAnd your family and I worry about it but crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean or or yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina is that Rami around me\nThrow me high romey high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was recently cold call and buy a\nKind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so I'll let you know term insurance and are with ability which I agreed with and that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some or some other quotes that were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah well those are those are kind of like\nThat those insurance companies aren't good their um their their ratings are high financially you want to go with the home or hire expensive\nUh insurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next\nTwenty years you know and I'm going to show you all\nLike oh okay um so I Need to buy you may think described as the Mercedes of ensuring you need to buy said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah I thought I wanted to get your thoughts on that [laughter]\nWell um that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are in our financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance there\nSo if they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nAnd I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have term in life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nOn less you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no\n[laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progression of goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about those progressive have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look I Am best ratings of someone at Zander insurance his website and they are all financially solvent as much as a good word that sell any of the stuff that's a that's a complete line of BS Ron Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and went on the the less expensive option anyway as you say\nWell I wouldn't I wouldn't do that from my family are\nYou a number and selling insurance and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that's when they call you that fails there's one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah [noise] yeah if you are doing investments with them if you're doing whole live life insurance with them which we don't recommend that you'd be a lot more concerned about the financial stability because you have a savings account there then [noise] um that's a lot more important than this\nOne time in our life

Know sometimes you feel powerless or overwhelm from living paycheck to paycheck\nBut you can take control of your money you just need to ride plan financial piece universities to step by step guide that teaches you\nAll right so here's the thing I don't want your house payment to be much more than a force of your take on ... is about a third of your take on by today but I think when I my four oh one K. back in your ... on on those four O. one K. it sounds like\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan as you're probably\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on by or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down substantially one mama came home I got that part\nBut still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nMhm so you got too much caught up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably gonna take you three years and they're shutting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still going to take a weapon on which way you sell but um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number two I'm getting out of it even if it had benefitted you even if you've got a fifty thousand dollar you're raised because of it I\nUsually have fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys a no no I Would show some toys I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets and\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone but I Want you to do what you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your on your own income\nNow if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice taught up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down\nYou look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff can be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house and you got surprised by me showing your toys but uh you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way I'm a boat and a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about\nBut that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value\nAnd so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\n... Dave thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view um I've got a question I have traveled the pass away of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear named tang to jobs that were possible careers to owning my own job\nAnd now I'm at a point where I'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base [laughter] but my question is for that\nNew one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work I have people but I have people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you're just doing all the work and honing your job I got ya okay right burglary so now I'm going to Atlanta and I hope to work on your business not just in it okay good right\nAnd so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that [noise]\nWell when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you can buy health insurance cheaper than you can\nFor them and so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to with us or they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nFor all that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without that are twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good a tree in my family being there when the baby is going to the ... or send them flowers or grandma funeral\nYou can treat 'em like human beings we don't get treated that way\n[noise] this is that Iran [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of
