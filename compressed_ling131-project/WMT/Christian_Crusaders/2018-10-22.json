{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Right you're making a little profit you know what might get a lot\nNo it's about a thousand a month I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that and that's you know when our jobs I Know that your gross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that\nCome up that that's the gross cash flow the different ... and the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yet you know yeah fire five ... five grand for around something like that I'm On a year from like the overall I Am right I mean some years will be better than others and that time on a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things are my Dutch\nUm the uh uh in what your household income\n[noise] um and so we bring about a hundred and ten gross to tell you what do you own your home our primary um we just heard just sit on ten months ago and we\nOwe to eighty and it's worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and ... and show he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you had a hundred and eighty official both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it in the discussion I'm All right [noise]\nYeah 'cause my thought is on as soon as break down and we have about ten thousand dollars left and and and got them in your ...\nUm we\nCombined probably twelve thousand 'cause they took a we had a lot but we took a bite out of and threw it out the debt so\nWe have any help now the now is like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you do your plan okay if you're going to be my plan you'd write a check today and be done for it\n[noise] yeah the only reason I was headed to end the call now because you're doing airplane and they\nKnow it's just that the end of the year I'm is always really tough and might feel you know in Iran\nSo it was just there in the event that on my condition that don't come through for the next three life [noise] um I was afraid liquidated Atlantic I don't think an extreme life being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas that everything goes well then I Would just write the check\nMhm okay but you're playing poker uh uh the\nUh uh you know ... ... you're not\nMaking a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could flip out and you're pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love ...\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one when the Scott more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nJust read the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so on my way one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity in Harlem I get anything on that and you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went by them for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the ... money on the house if you had a three month vacancy market shopper up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know we'll start working these by bishops the right way and following on through in getting the emerging cheap\nDone and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as followed on enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility that's separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that and that's ... that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco Hi Mike\nHow are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred in my emergency fund film among baby step on um the first time I've got a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay I Am and they're all going in a\nScene of like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're going to have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're wrong\nPut more in there yeah but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I've met people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going you know there's just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nAnd really quick I wanted to ask what should I invest in the financial peace university um or should I get that now

your realities that's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next month he'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures and ... you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predict the bombing Iran or your mortgage payment that's

and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement\nThat's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life

share and work much\nRight yes her\nSo she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on the student loan and if she has a one to then what change do take like five jobs and getting gear but that's going to be a shock to hurdles system\nBecause she didn't like the news to working much\nYeah so I mean that so what we're doing is we're training her
