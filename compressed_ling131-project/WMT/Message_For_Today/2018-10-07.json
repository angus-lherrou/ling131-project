{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Welcome back to the Iowa one connection I'm Jeff St on\nWe continue our discussion of possible changes to the twenty twenty Iowa presidential precinct caucuses now with Troy price\nChair of the Iowa Democratic party we spoke at the party's headquarters in West Des Moines on September twenty seven as we're approaching\nThis uh conversation I'm the one thing that we want to do is make sure that we preserve and protect the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and you know at the end of the day what the boxes are is you know never held ourselves out to be a primary it's a um neighborhood meeting it doesn't matter\nHow much money you have it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter uh you know uh\nWho you are a everyone can come to this man\nAnd they can have a spirited debate about what the future of our country should be and that's what Cox's have done\nAnd so we want to make sure that we can preserve that but with the DMZ is asking us to do a\nThrough the changes that were passed in August is there are several\nUh buckets but the ones that kind of impact us the most here in Iowa will be one and allowing for some form of absentee participation for those who will not be able to or could not attend\nTo reporting of the raw results from the first ... phase of the ... as a ensuring that we have a recount procedure in place so that we can if a if it's a\nClose and if a campaign request that that we can in fact recreate what happens in ... and ... be able to make sure that the results are accurate\nUm those are really kind of the three big buckets that we are looking at as we go forward here\nAnd the other one too is that locking the caucus night result is the final result so what has happened in years past is that you know the county level if one side doesn't get a there are folks out then it can change and then it can change again at the district convention that could change again at the state convention\nHere um the what happens on caucus night will be a is the winner and so from that point forward then everything will be preserved going up through the chain and so uh if it's projected that candidate acts gets for delegates to the DMZ well then they'll get for ... so we've got to work through\nIf candidate acts wins that many delegates in Iowa but doesn't make it past South Carolina doesn't make it past Florida if they released their delegates does that then open it up either for free connection or for some sort of a portion meant or am I premature in that\nI think that this is where the devil is going to be the details so we\nAre also starting the process now we're out doing this I'm listening post across the state they're translucent feedback on how we might be able to do that and sort of thinking through this we have until approximately\nYou know springtime a first part is going to be able to figure all this stuff out getting her delegate selection plans written and submitted to the DNC and so for us we're just starting the process of really\nPick up in earnest after after election day but uh but we're in the process right now it's starting to think through that so to answer your specific question I don't know the answer to that yet and uh\nOther states where that has happened when we were going to go take a look at how other states have dealt with this when they have primaries for example you know in New Hampshire there'd been candidate to drop out shortly after New Hampshire but they still have so many delegates that they were secure on that night\nSo we just go through that process and civil finger on exactly how to do that [noise]\nOne of the big sticking points of courses then how does Iowa State distinctive from New Hampshire and one of the concerns some had had\nWas if you report raw vote totals than it's starting to look like New Hampshire if you have an absentee process it may be too much like New Hampshire the first question is do you think that our singular identity will remain pure and secondly are the folks New Hampshire happy [laughter]\nWell for us uh again uh we want to preserve the spirit of the Iowa caucuses and so we want to preserve that feeling where folks can come together and actually discuss this a\nBecause it's one of the few places in politics that you can actually do that anymore and so we do want to make sure that but we also want to make sure that we're giving folks the opportunity to have their\nVoices heard um uh and for folks who may not be able to participate that's always been a challenge in\nYears past us or we're gonna take a really in earnest looking at how we might be able to make that happen in terms of New Hampshire you know I've traveled out there a a earlier this\nYear and I talked with our secretary of state and I stay in regular communication with my counterpart Hampshire\n[noise] and so you know we will continue to work with them and make sure that you know as we're going through this process keeps them up to date and you know if there are any land mines that uh or challenges that may be further down the road that we're not seeing [noise]\nMake sure that we're keeping folks in the loop on that so that the for early states have always worked really well together Iowa New Hampshire has definitely work very well together over the last Thirty years\nFor sure and so um you know we want to make sure that we are continuing that process and also considering to work with\nOptimal health introducing new Medicaid claims and Virginia and helping
