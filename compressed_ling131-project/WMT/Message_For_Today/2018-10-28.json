as a very wicked man and others often looked upon him in the same light\nBut see the difference was is the public and felt his need for a relationship with Christ\nHas burden of guilt and shame he came before Christ asking for mercy his heart is now open for the spirit of God to do is gracious work and sent him free for the powers in bondage of seeing that are part of this earth\nBut then when you look at the fair see both ... self righteous in his prayer and hit in his act of praying there he showed his heart was closed against the influence and the power that changing power of the Holy Spirit\nBecause of his distance from God he had no sense of his self defining moment in contrast with the perfect perfection in divine this of the holiness of God\nHe felt no need and does he received nothing the public and side need and he received much\nYou see if we see our sinfulness we cannot wait to make ourselves better how many times have we heard people say I am not good enough to come to Christ\nDo you expect to become better\nThrough your own efforts Jeremiah chapter Thirteen and versus twenty three tells us can the Ethiopian change your skin or the British spots there may you also do good who is a custom to doing evil\nYou see when people come to me and they say I've done all these bad things I Try to introduce them to Christ said well I Need to change these things before I come to him and Jeremiah is telling us know come to Jesus just the way you are you cannot change yourself\nYou see for is the time is now it's not tomorrow is it's not the next day the time is now to come to Christ just as we are with all the imperfections that we obtained in our lives\nThe help only comes from God we cannot wait longer for a stronger persuasion a stronger push or for a better opportunity or from our whole your feelings are tempers we can do nothing on our own\nWe must come to Christ just as we are\nBlessed not procrastinate procrastination that come to Christ is one of the devils greatest tools\nIn keeping us from that relationship with Christ will say let's put it off a split the process of of turning away from the things that we enjoy this world I'm going to put that off just a few more days I kind of like what's going on I Know it's not right\nBut I Want to continue for today and tomorrow I'll change friends let's start seeking this pure heart through the grace of Jesus today\nYou see there's real danger and putting off this call that Christ is implanted in his encouraging you to take turning away from the Holy Spirit\nChoosing your life away from God in the world that we live in the way we think that we are as okay we have to remember that no matter what level of transgression what level of sand that we may have or feel that we have in our lives\nWhen it is revealed to us we need to turn away and we need to begin the process of repentance if we don't do this now we're in danger of losing our lives\nYou see what we do not overcome will overcome us and destruction will surely fall and come upon us\nYou see every time you were I we commit lawlessness sin\nBig or small it doesn't matter every time that we ignore and reject the grace filled Colleen of Christ we begin a process of hardening our hearts numbing our understanding of are in need of Christ in our lives\nAnd not only making us less likely to yield\nBut being less capable to yield to the ... and the color you know the Holy Spirit in our lives to make these changes the hardening of the heart\nNow we can think that\nWe can't change these bad actions or we think that we can do these changes at another time\nWe can think that we can play with the ... of the mercy of Christ in our lives we can think that after we played in the devil's playground that we'll be able to change our lives into what ever and whenever we want to\nSee the problem is\nExperience education of a lifetime\nSo strongly and bold our character that very few of us will have the desire to receive the grace of Christ in his mercy in our lives at that whatever you want to call that feature time\nFriends it's kind of like a person that goes to the doctor [noise] they're having\nChest pains they know they have a need for something in their life so the doctor runs test and they check the arteries leading to the heart and they they come back and they say the reason you have these chest pains is because you're having some blockage in your arteries\nWell what does a blockage caused from another matter reasons for that but just be patient with me and this illustration today\nAnd the doctor says you're you're artery blocked from the from your lifestyle of the foods you're eating and and maybe what you're drinking\nAnd you go home do you think about it you say well I Know the doctors said this but I can put off this change for another day I don't need to make that change right now I'll be okay\nYou know next month next year I'll cut back on the foods that I mean I'll change my diet or exercise more I'll make these changes but over this time of lay the\nArteries filled more and more and pretty soon there is so full they cause a heart attack\nWhere we would have made that change immediately when the doctor said it may have eliminated any need for any more medical procedures you see friends Christ is ready to set us free from our sins today\nWe but we must understand\nHe will not end does not forced himself upon us just like the doctor or force himself or forced the suggested changes upon us if we ... persisted in our own ways if ... desire to be set free and accept his gift of
