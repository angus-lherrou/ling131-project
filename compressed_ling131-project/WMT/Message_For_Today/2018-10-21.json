{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "That is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense and it's interesting because today people are very very concerned about a fence and offending others and and from our research we found that one of the main reasons why people are apprehensive\nWhen sharing their faith is the fear of a fence\nBut the the irony of it is that the message that we have is inherently offensive in a stumbling block\nSo just like the Bible passage tells us we preach Jesus and Jesus crucified and it is this stumbling block it is as you said\nAn offense an offense to the Jews and a follow lead to the ... it's a it's a fence to our reason it's right in your face that says you can't understand this the only thing you can possibly do is trust\nLooking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael Ziegler is going to make his debut yeah the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about that\nI think that's great [laughter] um as as one who has filled in 'em over this past year when we have been in our vacancy speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here I Am also thrill because he brings to the table\nSuch a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel and um every time I hear him preach I learned something new from it I'm engaged by it\nAnd I know that our listeners will be as well so I Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know this not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team\nAnd so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing and he speaks into that that process as well so uh well he's a voice or on the radio he is also a valuable partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel is the whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style and to the program in the case of Dr Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that theater of the mind and you know making use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nYeah he has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it ... and um he presents it in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the interim the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was he read the Bible passage\nAnd I was like wow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages who's going to be great but he has he has a talent\nFor interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for conveying with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes and you can visualize a what's going on in the\nMessage and just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have\nIt just kind of going in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully 'cause he's going to take you on a journey with his sermons\nYeah your salvation spree but listen live work you know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was at the cemetery professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things but the way that he presents the message\nI think okay I haven't thought about it like\nThat before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whereas we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nAnd the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way and engaging way in a stimulating way\nTo

David made no effort\nWhen they finally came to the realization of what he had done that Iran he made no effort to sugarcoat what he had done he can before the lord himself and following this disclosed his guilt he had no desire to escape judgment\nDavid side the enormity of is wrong you the ... of his soul\nYou can even he loathed the sin committed to many times when people commit\nIt raw against God they're sorry\nFor it but they don't do that so much that they turn away from it and don't go back to it\n\nYou long for the joy of holding us to be restored in harmony comedian was God\nThis is the language of his prayer we find them psalms fifty one now once you're right that some down so I'm fifty one so we're going to look at a few verses up here just a minute I don't want to time during the whole section this morning but versus one through fourteen is Davis prayer\nAnd it starts out\nLike this have mercy upon me or God according you love and kindness according to the multitude tend to ... bought out my transgressions\nDavid new really he was wrong he came to God in this way\nI acknowledge my transgression and my son is ... always before me then saying I Know I Can't run from my sons are always going to be with me and I'm Sorry for that I Want a bottom out and I recognize that you're the one that came\n\nAnd he goes on his courage me what's this up and I

in your salvation and my relationship with you end up hold me by your generous spirit\nDelivery me from the guilt of bloodshed you see when we've have fully repented we've fully they ask God to forgive us and we accept as forgiveness there was not guilty for those things that we have done wrong\nMy tongue she'll sing allowed your righteousness\nIn you know this is David ... thoughts David's lamenting this was true repentance\nBeyond the reach of our own power to accomplishment he knew it was only going to be a pain by his relationship with Christ\nIs given as a gift to you and I you see\nThis is where a lot of people in the world today and make a mistake the question that has been asked for years as what came first the chicken or the egg\nIs a Christian formula to this is you know that\nWhat comes first repentant summer relationship with Christ\nYou ever think of it\nIt's the same question we're asking for years what comes first the chicken or the egg\n\nWe think that we can come we cannot come to Christ we think that we cannot come to Christ unless we go through the repentance process first\nThat we have to repent first and that is where\nThen we prepare ourselves in the process of repentance we prepare ourselves for forgiveness of our sim\nLet me ask you a question how did you know you needed to repent how'd you know they did something wrong in your life\n\nIt comes from God God is the one who instilled in our lives the knowledge of it was right and wrong here within his word the Bible yes we have the ten commandments ten great rules\nI fully support and fully understand and fully accept each one of them as written by God's on hand\nWith the rest of the scripture also gives the lines right lives by commandments teachings of God\nAnd as I read those things I find out that my life falls short of completing well he has asked me this child to do\n\nNow have to ask myself a question if I recognize that\nDon't already have a relationship with God why\nWould he revealed those things to someone who doesn't have a relationship with him up some level I'm not saying it's a great deep spiritual chasm level that greater than anybody else was world I'm saying that there is a initial\nRelationship with him at that point\nBecause you've allowed him to let that Holy Spirit speaking your life\n\nNow make no mistake repentance does come before forgiveness that is true\nAnd it's only through that truly broken that truly contrite that truly sorrowful heart\nThat began to feel is need for a savior\nThat I even know and have a desire to see for something better to see for forgive us in my life\nOn the question comes\nMost of the center wait till he had repented before he can come to Jesus is repentance to be made an obstacle that that wall between the center and the savior can I\nNot ... is it not possible for me to have a relationship with Christ if I have not repented in my life\n\nI don't believe that Jesus ever taught at a center needed repent ... before you could er before he was welcomed into her relationship with Jesus Christ\n\nMatthew chapter eleven versus twenty eight\nWe all know the words come onto me all your labor
