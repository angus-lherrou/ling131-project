Lutheran our bringing Christ to the nation's\nToday's program presents a timeless message from Dr Oswald Hoffman about things that change and the God does\nMaking the cross of Christ you're alone will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you\nIt will give them got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be\nAnd that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nDr Hoffman's messages titled\nPreach Christ crucified [noise]\nHello I'm Mark I sure thanks for joining us today your gifts and prayers help aloof to run our bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your faithful support\nRapid technological and social change is not new it was already taking place more than sixty years ago when the sermon we're about to hear was first broadcast here's how Lutheran our speaker Dr Oswald Hoffman expressed it in this message from Nineteen fifty five\nAt the close of this last session of the United States Congress representative introduced a bill they're given name astronaut to a new object not yet an existence the latest addition to the family whose birth has been announced as being about two years off\nIs the satellite which scientists hope to shoot into outer space\nIt is expected to revolve around here it's about two hundred three hundred miles above the earth's surface and to keep on going around for several weeks or even for months until it finally re enters our atmosphere and there's destroyed by the heat which friction will then create\nThings are happening pretty fast these days when the dreams of a decade ago become reality so quickly\nPeople dreamed about flying for centuries for example before flying actually became a reality\nAnd then it didn't come through the flapping wings and some people thought it would but right up through the application to power driven craft of the principles which enabled birds to fly by simply flapping their wings and by gliding about motionless in the sky\nAll of this took a long time\nToday events move more quickly Frederick Lewis Allan titled his book about the years Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred and fifty the big change\nThe biggest changes however have taken place since Nineteen hundred and fifty during the last five years there is the prospect of even bigger things to come\nWith automation industry for example automation was a term coined by a Ford Motor company executive in Nineteen forty five to describe the new industrial revolution in which machines are being developed to run the machines that we already have\nSeveral a of Canada has a machine to city blocks long it completely processors motors and the assembly of automobiles the telephone dial system bank clearing houses and other enterprises are in the midst of automation right now\nWho is to say how much our lives are going to be affected by these developments\nAs well as those in the field of the peaceful use of Atomic Energy which are coming along a lot faster than most people recognize right now things are happening so fast but it is impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better\nIs there no way to get a grip on anything in our rapidly developing civilization\nSomeone has said that our world has been so quickly inoculated with Christianity that very likely will never catch the real thing\nIs there a real saying something you can hang onto if so what is it\nI Want to talk to you for just a few minutes about the real thing the one that never changes it's what we preach about on this program\nWe preach Christ crucified St Paul said that\nHe went on to say that wherever he preached Christ crucified\nHe was met by in credulity and skepticism\nAbout we preach Christ crucified he said on through the Jews that is to the people who took religion seriously a stumbling block and under the Greeks\nThat is the people who were intellectual foolishness but under them which are called both Jews and Greeks without discrimination Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God it did not bother St Paul's that people could not seem to understand the simple fact of Christ cross\nOr did not even want to try to understand it\nHe did not modify his preaching a water it down because of this fact he just said this is what we preach we preach Christ crucified take it or leave it but when you don't even remember what you are leaving behind and what it is going to mean to you\nWe preach Christ crucified at St Paul's way of saying that sin or whatever other named you wanted to give to departure from God and his law\nIs a costly business it costs somebody crucifixion it costs us most of all those of us who are singers and all of us is not has sooner\nSoon makes cowards of us all and it makes us enemies as well you've heard him and say I'm In the doghouse these days what do you mean to say is that he made an appointment with his wife to select wallpaper for the living room and then forgot all about it\nA promise to bring home ice cream for dinner and failed to remember his promise he came in and out of the rain and track ... over the living room run\nIt takes a good case and maybe a bouquet of flowers the next day to get things straightened out all too often being in the doghouse is not only a matter of our having encouraged the anger if somebody else\nBut it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them and us through our own feeling of guilt we don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong it only makes things worse to know\nSo that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God\nThe meaning of Christ cross is that God took the initiative to break that wall down to get us out of their spiritual dog house\nAnd this was known me a tactical maneuver on his part he loved us he pity dies he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in a way of that love is even if it meant taking all our guild upon himself God so love the world that he sent his only be gotten son\nAll we like she had gone astray we turn to every one to his own way but the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all\nHe was wounded for our transgressions\nHe was bruised for our inequities upon him was laid the chest is meant that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified St Paul said that as if there is a connection between the cross and our seeing\nAnd there is a Saint Paul said to the collections God has forgiven you all your sins\nChrist tests utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which always hung over our heads and it's completely a noted by nailing it over his own head toward across\nAnd then having drawn this thing of all the powers ranged against us he exposed them shattered empty and defeated in his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the resurrection\nYou have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the annoying feeling at your soul that you want to everything that you should be\nAre you constantly irritated by your business associates your friends members have your family I bothered by temptations of one kind or another I keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking that cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give you got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which caused St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send me to see how many I could baptize but to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive ... of clever words but I have no desire to Rob the cross is power\nThe preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world whitewash who are being saved from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God it is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... of the prudent will I reject\nFucking city or what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world to show for all of their wisdom has not gone made the wisdom of this world look foolish", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "21"}
