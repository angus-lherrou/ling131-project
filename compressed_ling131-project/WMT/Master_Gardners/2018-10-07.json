{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "You they still need your help lord they still need you to give them that piece that you promised\nTo establish them so lord gives success send me Nehemiah your servant and gives me mercy in the site of the man\nThe king used need to do your will a man and a chapter ends\nChapter one at that time I was ... bears to the king\nThat says loads being a ... there was an important job speed the royal ... Baron means that you had had it made you you can trust to you you had a access to the king and influence are all kinds of benefits\nMe and my I was ... Persia\nAnd what happens next is amazing after three months of brain like that the king one day seemed to trouble look on the minus faced asked him why the sad face Nehemiah what's the matter and near my explains his sadness and his desire to\nGo back home and help his people and rebuild the wall of Jerusalem\nThe king thinks about that as a couple of more questions consults with his wife was sitting there with him\nAnd winds up saying yes to me and my last request to go back home he also gives him letters of passport for safe passage there and lumber and materials for the project and an armed escort as well [laughter]\nIsn't that something while the prayers been answered me and my aunt goes and when he gets very takes a night walk around the city people there don't know yet what he's up to\nAny of the few people with them and after he goes around examines the walls of the city that night he sits down with them and he gives them a vision division given in a testimony\nTo God answering his prayer to actually come home to do this and the leaders they buy into the plan\nAnd they begin to go to work to restore the walls of Jerusalem and that battered little community underneath their mind as leadership eagerly and passionately went to work to restore their holy city\nIs your eat on in this story we find it wasn't an easy task by any means some days it seemed like in him possible task one thing I've learned along the way as you probably have to is carried out God's mission never is an easy thing\nHe faced opposition from a three men named uh San ... to ...\nA a ... who was an amateur night and they they were fearful of losing political and economic control over the area so they tempted to stop this whole project by a variety of tactics\nThey didn't want to see this wall go up they tried first of all intimidation tactics telling my knee and my and the people were watching you you better be afraid\nThey tried to even having a planned attack on the wall workers but it was foiled and then they tried slander and lies about me and my aunt spreading the rumor that he's just declaring himself a king\nThey tried to fascination as I said come visit us Nehemiah\nAnd many of my refuses to get off the wall he says I'm doing a great work I cannot and will not come down and there was character assassination\nThey told him through a a an inner person to seek protection and the temple behind closed doors because he was about to come under attack they thought if he ran to the temple and hit himself that would ruin his reputation as a real leader nothing more than a big scare the cat they could say\nAnd finally the devils at work\nEven in their own ... there is greed causing some problems the rich nobles in officials\nAmong the juice worth taking advantage of the poor who are having to ... everything to pay their interest in taxes\nAnd try to keep food on their tables was almost impossible and they were working on the wall besides and the kids were being taken away from them as payment and they're they're just not making it so they're rightfully complain ...\nMe and my takes off after those rich people on their behalf and gets them to give back what they'd taken as well as promised to not take advantage of the poor any longer\nTurns out that even and all of this Nehemiah himself was doing this job for no pay\nAnd to top it all off he dug into his own pockets to fund the workers who are ready to give up the project and quit and the strike was averted and lo and behold the wall is done completed\nAfter only fifty two days miraculous\nAnd the surrounding nations scripture tells us in chapter six of Nehemiah were fearful\nFor they knew God had been at work\nHere these words and when all our enemies heard of this all the nations around us were afraid and felt greatly in their own esteem for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God\nGod was glorified before the nation's\nPretty amazing story isn't it I'm surprised at Hollywood hasn't made a movie of it yet what does it have to do with us though does it have anything to say to our time our day it does\nIt near my as the last of the history books in the Old Testament\nSo we must remember this is another chapter of God's redemptive history that began back in genesis three when God said that he would crush the head of the serpent and injustice twelve that he would make Abrahams descendants a blessing to the nations of the world\nThis was another chapter this was a time when God's people were disgraced in on the ropes and people wonder would God's Plan lay waste had he deserted them to make it on their own was this beyond his help and the good news is God did not desert them he sent someone\nA cup bearer of the king to put things back together again so that his great redemptive plans could move on\nGod is faithful to his people we see it in this story today as I said this was a chapter in a much bigger story or restoration project in the midst of a much bigger restoration project restoration of the world about four hundred years later a new ... bear will\nEnter the scene is restored Jerusalem and he will pray in a garden before his crucifixion father take this ... from me\nThe couple of God's wrath is what he's talking about for humanity's sin Jesus would step down from his heavenly court to save and restore his people he to one day when we over Jerusalem himself\nAnd face all kinds of opposition and enemies as he assured his rebuilding project into this world is fathers kingdom\nAnd on across he will build something All right a bridge between God and humanity restoring rescuing his last people and they mocked him and they invited him to come down to use them aside\nAnd he was tempted to give up buddy didn't I'm doing great work and I cannot come down just like me and my aunt\nAnd got raised him from the grave affirming the new government in his blood\nAnd the story moves on this God continues as restoration through the church you and me bringing others into his kingdom slowly but surely moving us towards that new Jerusalem that new heaven and earth at the end of creation totally restored\nGod's work finally completed and that my friends is one of the great reasons to pray God faithfulness\nThis story is not so much about ... leadership and power but we do learn some important things to his experiences it's more about gods faithfulness and grace that he has given us is valuable tool called prayer and that he answers prayer\nThis is a prayer and hard work story not just the prayer at the beginning of his memoirs but all the way through the project he's praying praying for help praying for strength praying for protection say remember oh lord\nHe accomplishes great things this God through obedient servant who answer is called to serve and who prey this story is for his workers meaning if you're in Christ you and me are God is on changing that same grace and stress\n\nI
