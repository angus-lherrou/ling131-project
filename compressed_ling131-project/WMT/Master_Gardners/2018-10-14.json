{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "That God has already done his work\nAs he responds to prayer God does answer prayer in his own time and in his own ways we need to simply keep praying and keep looking for those answers you see the big idea for them\nIs that the same God who heard the prayers and rescued Peter and sort of the spreading of the good news of Jesus to the ancient world\nIs still able to do the unimaginable and the possible he is the same yesterday the day and forever so people have God pray confidently pray boldly pray constantly\nYou know someone that's far from God that needs Jesus Christ in their life than pray\nFirst for an opportunity to witness or for an open door to have a relationship or for someone else to be able to witness no dark situation where evil seems to be winning pray\nFor the light of the gospel to shine in that situation for God's power to go to work\nAgainst evil you know of a church is struggling to keep its doors open pray first that God might revive that church with this Holy Spirit and bring it to life fanned the flames with the gospel\nYou have a pastor or a chaplain or another ministry that you want to see the drive for the cause of the kingdom of God pray for God to use that individual might really to his glory and his honor\nWanting God to use you to build his kingdom in some way pray first pray for opportunities and for insights on how God might want to use you\nRecently I I came across a story out of Christianity day magazine written by a lady named Brenda McNeil amazing story about the power of prayer\nShe writes I once met a brother from Ghana West Africa ... who is completely in his PHD in the school of world missions at full or seminary\nDuring one of his troops home he attempted to share the gospel with several people who lived in the community although they listen respectfully no one turned to Jesus Christ\nHe later learned that they were intimidated by a witch doctor who lived nearby the witch doctor kept a symbol of his authority hanging outside his home a lattice basket filled with water that never leaked\nMy friend decided to pray that God would empty the basket\nHe stayed outside the home of the witch doctor and prayed all night that God would demonstrate his power at some point he fell asleep the next morning and he was awakened by a commotion the basket was empty\nThat town saw amassed revival as people learned about the God who caused the water to come out of the basket there had been a power in counter and God had one just like our story today people of\nGod let us commit ourselves\nTo be people of prayer\nAs individuals as churches I Believe that the church could have so much more power to accomplish great things for God if we just for brain more we need to always be remembering those assuring words of another early Christian\nMan named the apostle Paul listen to these words that he wrote if God is for us who's against us he who did not withhold his own son but gave him up for all of us will he not with him also give us every thing\nElse could question people of God maybe we'd be known\nAs a brain people trusting are great and loving
