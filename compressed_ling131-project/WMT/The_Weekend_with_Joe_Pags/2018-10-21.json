T.\n\nI live in if you're not getting all three hours that came commando show joined Kim's club that's right head over to get Kim Dotcom\nAnd for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you

head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona so low there Tom\n... what's going on well I have a\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist and ah of ah a website that I have one son line right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website\nUh where people could ask questions before they came in and the the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you all you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of backup do I need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions and what have you\nYou know all of his yeah all really good questions by the way Tom\nYou know we breathed deployed shop dot ... dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone in place so I just recently was approached by a company that said what they would do is they would have a a a employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work as they would give me\nThirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask and then those are three questions I Would give them the interest as well so as I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have to ask the question of who she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd always send in ... she goes to one of those ... question\nYeah and I got here's the reason why I'm hesitating that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get in a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact to getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on but I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage\nBe people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building for you\nAh yes well the the we do have a website it's already been billed than we have another company building or another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters seem kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also list some of those questions under ... cues as the part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and box and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad and the staff here on the

jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine\nThat would be nuts\nThat would be absolutely nuts\nAre let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian\nWhy am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first\nWoman of color to be a professor at Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard she's been making this clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian\nSo the president like he's apt to has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid\nHe calls her Pocahontas I think it's funny as hell people were offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor you know like Rachel does all who's white like Sean King who's white\n\nYou know they're both pretending to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems as though I'm pretending to be an American Indian\nWhich are well because my cheekbones proves that no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nThe president been calling around and he said do a DNA test if you could prove to me that you're an Indian or give a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test\nGet to the test back and gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write those big story that you prove that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four it's Native American\n\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well\nThe most you could possibly because one sixty fourth\nNative American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison\nOf her DNA to DNA of American Indians in fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was with South American\nNative tribes\nAnd maybe she's got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBoth the probability is one in one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this proves that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's a fact some you making it up as a fact she's not America in American indian she's got benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved herself but it is\nShe is so not American in the end of the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now or what made that bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nA\nShared the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which we live\nGuy let that sink in that any time you go through this week figuring that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week an affront to yourselves while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story any ... any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start\nThis whole thing up again and you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again\nWhy I decided I had to do a a a package parity about the color Pocahontas I'll have that for you when we come back if you're not familiar

I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first\nI'm going to actually do this ... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day of Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour father in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of us down and said\nI Want to invest in two days before the famous ... first day during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell a lie about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up\nBut like I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is do smart when it comes to negotiating\nSeeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what parents with trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this for ... it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked all the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of this country and if we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally\nWorth it because I really think the country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents this country's ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president's ... back in twenty six team up because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media\nYou told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well just they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nShow when ... when was the realization for you in the family that\nThis was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually snow for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to work there because I Would see all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things and and say hey that's\nNot what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there\nFor for forever if you know he became president ... but um\nBut certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child needs to make this talk about it is it is so crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to McCain president that if he got in there\nThere was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end so um I have to say that it's just another sign that he's doing a great job\nI Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump ear because her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people go and vote\nIn Texas where I should go Ted Cruz the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by the guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist describe your work\nLook at places like Michigan or Debbie Stabenow it's been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get that show that Israel's seat this really is going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote I mean that's really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you're right now I'm In Minnesota\nNot traveling a campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be on your ironically in Michigan I miss it so so important that we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's a lot of people against and even people want and don't party sometimes money and get it right about what could happen if he had a ... a people behind him that voted on by\nPresident and and really pushing the younger forward we can do much more progress in this country and by the way\nI Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states and America if we let people like or or take over and and put him to get into foreign it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that\nShould shock everybody to agree that you know not only are going to get out and got in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go about it it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly what the fight isn't over\nYou and you can't get back can't relax we can't be like me to get out to vote and put people in\nCongress that we're going to vote with the president if Iraq\nIf anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk today because zoos are delicious who's his wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials will show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country it is horrific\nShort period of my ... my board up I've got my daughter who's the screener of the phone call Sam so we we have a good time and we

alleged blue wave going to happen although I truly believe that two or three Senate seats will will be added will be gained by the Republicans\nIn the house is now up for grabs everybody but everybody's been saying the house is going to go is going to go left is going to go blue I'm not so sure man the cabinet bounce is hurting Democrats big time a couple of days ago Dianne Feinstein who

and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there are a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really I mean we thought I'm born and raised in Florida we've seen a lot of storms that young when you're at home better Ninety to buy the worst damage I've seen\nI turned to Panama Sandy in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area so I'm a I'm an ... and was totally out um they're starting to get power back off\n\nOn a structural damage because you had basically a category five\nI'm Talking to some of this year they're um they're actually progress things a little bit at a schedule which is good I think uh\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end of the day it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's a certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know\nIt secondary obviously we're talking around to see if there is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might\nBe not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um are going to be out is that getting to handle a jacket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people you're still in the county but I think you're looking at having additional\nPolling locations and then I think there's going to be a consideration or if you are display or you can vote and other county uh your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by that that's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time\nThese are resilient people I don't you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very simple minded so I think a lot of them are even though they\nGot a lot of there's got to deal with I didn't get to the police showed up and walked the chain a gate at the cat's about\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor of the great state of Florida rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida was there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there my sisters were there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming and and the southern bureau Florida that it's very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but of a lot of like this\nLose drinks and school boards and and a lot of the the sheriff's officers do lean left or how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand the yours or your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida as for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism they don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country how we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this\nWay in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a\nPro Israel leaders in the country have been in Congress\nGillum and hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is a prominent in the ... movement against Israel say say Israel's genocidal apartheid say I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you don't want to pose this\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA tunnel indivisible capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about how we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas\nThat may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more anti Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew yellow who's really align with the radical\nLeft a which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table\nYou know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic\nVote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics sent in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California um and then of course in central Florida you know we had", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags",
