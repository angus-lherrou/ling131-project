I mean they would have been I mean how do you how do you have those are the guys you're probably talking about the change the game\nI'm saying that those guys would have with the rules in place been able to be as physical or more by lowering their shoulders putting it in your gut and wrapping up because their feet would've taken them there any way\nBut they were playing in the world they play them so they played that type of football to the best of their ability which is way higher than anybody could imagine\nWhat's also interesting to me about this if you're suggesting as quickly as the game happens that in this case a money Jones but athletes in general bank back play ... would have the ability to make that adjustment\nYes trust me you know what you do you do what you're going to do\nI Know whether I'm going to be for before I get there I don't know whether I Need to either use my forearm or get my hats and my two hands on I Know that just by the way your lined up or wait the way you're set up and ... and what I'm intending to do [noise]\nAnd you're about to have another targeting called come up right here in\nOrder to wire yeah but that that was helmet to helmet contact and he left the ground yeah mhm yeah but\nIt but it's but it's not different because it's still destructive to the other person is playing the game and that's what they're trying to get rid of if they want you tackling they want shoe making contact physically but not trying to Maine\nMhm or issuing hits that may end up with that result three six five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty four I Want to restore six hundred over here like and are showing this next on the altar for cat Hawkeye had all shot or do you think tonight [noise]\nBig as it was just wondering that people don't talk about up to survive and very often but ah we're a little biased we're up here in Mount Vernon so we've been watching just in the worst place for several years up here and he's just a he's a great kid he's huge he's athletic\nUm I didn't get to see the whole game today that he blocked on an outside zone play today took like three guys out handle those so last year in that Ohio State game\nReally well just interested to hear what you think of as a ... a lot of stuff for all that so far in his career and and what you think is a teacher my old for and both the rest of this pouch clear and maybe beyond that\nAlso maybe get Louis sandwiches mentioned our doughnuts and\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nHe's got his wings here that's why I was worried about every little bit ago reaching him and grabbing one [laughter]\nYou know on on within the way to nothing man I came in this afternoon and [laughter] I I was out the window was picked up a little bit man I rode across the street a couple of times diet is going to order I probably wouldn't recognize anymore or what I write [laughter]\nIf you believe what he's saying yeah you ever that might lead you to that conclusion but uh [laughter] All right John thanks so much for joining in here and a contributing editor for cat Hawkeye huddle tested worse\nGuys beast I'd like to get the first game yeah we took him a little bit [noise] gets I Would say to get back in there but [noise]\nYeah what is the um size was\nThree twenty six three six for once you once you get 'em over three ten doesn't really matter yeah it doesn't matter that is true that the other point\nI mean uh I like the kid because he's athletic I had to see him play a few times in high school I'm I'm just a great kid overall just as personality smart kid um\nAnd and he's just athletic can use a freak of a beast in terms of his of athleticism\nAnd it's hard to find a kid like that has the feet I think he was also a wrestler as well\nIn high school and um [noise] I I like the kid I still needs some developing obviously on this level but I I mean I have nothing but a great thing to say about in terms of its is athletic ... one of the tougher positions on that old line as well\nAnd for the record six five three twenty yeah right on the money [noise]\nOkay so from for me right versus a shot put her in a restaurant which means two things she as solid hips one solid hips the second thing would be his hips are ex most if he can use that [noise]\nOkay [noise] once you take that combination of seizing explosive miss ability to bend so that you can use your hips to power your body you get an ... you get a different level of athlete\nSitting in an NFL locker room everybody around you you just look around and everybody is freakish\nIn some way you have a super power of some sort or whatever it is you can read things faster you have better vision things show up in color to you you have a pinkie finger that works like a some I don't know what it is [laughter]\nI always said about Sean green that he could he recites the numbers of the different players coming at him and where they were after a play right to the point you're talking about that right not natural no\nIt's not you have some sort of heightened sense for ability or your body works that way right that propels you pass everyone else in this game and it just in worse exhibits those traits [noise]\nIn two ways his explosive is right and the ability to use his feet to produce at explosives in his second ways is punch you want to see a great tackle see a guy that could punch yeah deliver a blow\nRight I I got to hang out and be around Leon Searcy had his prime they aren't sure she was a right tackle from the Jackson\nWe'll jaguars the I'm sure she would literally stop a Mack truck with his punish [laughter] I don't it could become an sixty miles an hour that guy would just slam waste and that that that thing would ripper and run backwards [laughter]\nRussia is in some of the best bass rushes in the league we're on our team ... because we're here see we're in air sea like championship contending team won on a loss on a last second thing to go to the super bowl\nHe's shocking these guys stopping them in their tracks with one blow\nRight mhm people like that don't come along all the time Brian blogging you got to watch one developed mhm you know Marshall yawned than here in Iowa we get to see some of the best the best and I\nWe do have to get better at it in its a few areas but um marked improvement from week to week and that's what we've been seeing 'em\nAnd I just really hope that we peek at the right time where we can put this whole thing together um and we're still kind of you know there's just bits and pieces of us right now this bill in the lab right now under ... you know on the ...\nYou know look at the numbers for interceptions seven tackles for laws including five facts I mean that there are a lot of defense is that if you love to have that kind of production and they're not well as I catch him with his mouth [laughter]\nNo you're absolutely right I I'm\nNot being critical at all I I don't measure critical I just I just I just felt like\nThere were there were times where I thought uh maybe we could be a little bit better than\nWhat you're looking at ... I guess I I mean I thought we have been better choices what we were\nGoing to three hundred and twenty totally arts two hundred and thirty four of them through the air or let me ask you this Tom does this make a difference to you at all I was started to freshman quarterback for the first time since two thousand\nAnd do you care to take a guess who was starting as true freshmen quarterbacks in two thousand\nA couple of guys by the name of Benny sap and Bob Sanders [laughter] so I think I forgot about Benny but I I was thinking about Bob [noise]\nThat does that easier concern a little bit of time in literally I was not been as inexperienced in the defense of backfield as they work today since the early days of the ... Sarah okay\nThere you know one of them had to\nYeah while the other one I had one pick Brent are friends had one and a and bought him off to and I thought brands Twenty one a lot like Josh Jackson but thanks for checking in time it already six five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty four owners are six hundred over here like for true freshman quarterbacks will\nFirst time on the field basically for some of the field starting ... how did it go your first time on the field\n[laughter] I remember that I Do remember it really and\nAnd it was it was the it was an exciting experience for me so much that ah I didn't get much playing time afterwards in ... and here's what happened [laughter] I Know I Know know how much time with that but I Try to get through it really quick um I was a strict and screen full back\nFreshman year a freshman year got just came off my red shirts I was a freshman and I hadn't anticipated playing very much\nSo on the sideline I was I was paying attention to the game but I really wasn't paying attention because I really didn't think that I was going to get in the game so out of nowhere I'm\nRichard Bass was the was the starting pull back\nAnd um\nFor some reason he had to come out of the game so coach comes over and kinda coach fry a coach Jackson comes over all your accent if you ever have to say is Lou Montgomery\nI'm like oh what what what did I knew\nI was I was on the sidelines drinking all the Jews you know so I got my love your article I got a full belly full of like ... okay waving to the crowd wave into the crowd Hi mom everybody and everybody I so I called me and he says you got to get in the game\nSo close fried is it going to close fries locals Franco's fry a lotta times called the place so he sends me in to the game folks and it gives me probably the longest pull\nA ... I\nMean the entire plate okay [laughter]\nI'm standing there and it's like pro right Seventy five X Y Z and squirrels squirrel that wiggle that pay [laughter] and literally pushes me out\nTo about mid ... up to about the hash marks where the one the one hand and and I and the clock is ticking and I get about two and a half of march and remember and realize that I forgot everything costs fried just said [laughter]\nEvery single thing that was just said is gone okay so now I have to make a decision do\nI go back and ask for clarification or do I continue to the huddle and risk either a timeout probably or delay him you know I Am not having the best interest of the team in mind not worried to burn a U.S time out or or cost\nThe team five yards you I'm I'm On national TV I'm In front of Seventy thousand fans and I'm going to the huddle [noise] so I have no idea what no idea on what the ... [laughter]\nSo I Walk into this photo that I'm unfamiliar with because I never played on that stage before and are older guys are looking at me like okay are you going to say some or will and I'm sitting in a huddle literally like I'm\nOK guys and I'll listen real close okay\nI'm a pro right check with me and that was the best I had which was telling the quarterback that he can call it whatever you want ... Rogers lose Matt Rogers at a time and ah they looked at me like that doesn't sound like I'm like come on man we got to go [noise]\nSo then they make matters even worse\nI I'm a little break the huddle break Matt gets to the line and any checks to a different\nFormation formation auto hey yeah he was audible lies so now I'm In my stance I forgot the ... [noise]\nHe audible eyes as to what is this something that I knew only to realize that the color that he called the dummy call your [laughter]\nI had a felony color with W colors and then on top of that to make matters worse\nI got the snap count [laughter]\nAnd [laughter] yeah\nSo that the step count was too is not count was to I went on one now you're outside ... side and on line and a coach fried just shaking his head coach Jackson just is Leon himself and I am still literally standing there like okay this is\nSo so they wave to me just stay in the game right so I'm like wow [noise]\nYeah okay great [noise] stay in the game they bring in another player and uh I kinda got the groove of things after that but after we didn't pick up the first town\nSo the walk from where we were at to sideline was really to me felt like about Fifteen miles [noise]\nBecause that was the longest walk the ever had caused by someone standing there in\n... yeah so it was I was practice the next week oh Iran so many cross ills and stares and study that play book man I Know that play book to this day how bet you do ... to play go F rumble [laughter]\nForty one or two or three school already three pop out oh yeah I play right there forty ...\nSo that was my experience folks how was your first trip to the field job it\nWas very on glorious yeah yes you didn't forget to play I did not forget the play because I didn't know what to do when the play started because I was playing defense for the first time really yes at outside linebacker against Penn State cow Brady was just a man monster [noise]\nSo I'm standing up in front of him in there about the snap the ball and I'm like okay what did they say now I got to step forward and\nShoot my hands [laughter] and then shove him back [laughter] and then find the ball that sounds easy enough rice\nSimple step forward [noise] shoving back right [noise] and then find the ball I've got this I Am one bad freshmen from Canada yeah buddy and we're going to play outside linebacker huh\nWell you know I've been practicing it outside linebacker go that Sam backer and in the five to scheme where you stand up and so I've been practicing so I felt that was pretty confident and you know [noise]\nAnd you know but the thing was I didn't have to go against the senior tight end too often\nIn practice no because I was on the varsity side of the same so I was going against the freshman tight and believing that that's how it works out there and when you go you know you get out on the field and gain day new on game day against Penn State Lu\nI Know I it doesn't work that way no\nNo\nSee when you get against diversity tied into the nose thanks [laughter] you might not know yet\nBut the varsity defensive in a outside linebackers they know that stuff too so they can fight against each other for me I was like step forward for my hands on I'm driving back find the ball ... whatsoever I simply go wrong thing nothing\nNothing simple and yeah so ice ball snack I get grabbed [laughter]\nWait I'm not on the ground anymore\nSports fans of Sandy West and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in

these links show up ... who would've thought I Can't let that wins the waste though yeah you're on the Hudson it's outside to have okay bye week okay improvement I\nYou know this is one of the better by week that we've had historically it'd be perfectly honest with you that that come off of a by we we typically historically have not done real well this year I think we did much better job of ah getting our guys prepared so I I\nI like it I liked the improvement I liked the tenacity these guys came up with not only coming out the ... going on the road for the first time yeah that was different\nI thought that played a little bit into you know we were typically a third or fourth quarter kind of team that you know will kind of\nPlay around with you for the first second quarter is if we can\nCome in and make some judgments at half time and then the third fourth quarter at least this year we've been able to really kind of on and kind of where people down or teams down but um we did a nice job overall complete complete game today still some things that work on but\nFor the most part I'm I'm pleased Trevor by wake improvements impress well utilized as we've certainly that here before after ... weeks and thought just the opposite [noise]\nThe thing I think that we were able to do there were several things I noticed one there was times where ... and\nA map and that's what we're on the feel the same time which happened a little bit against Iowa State and mhm but I think I think it just became more of a thing mhm and I think they worked on it through this by we cook right um the other thing is I watch this uh\nI Hope it became a consistent thing\nWith this vertical passing game and utilizing the wide receivers and that that that marinating that happens\nYou know [noise] well see I mean as I said I mean well their seat post game microphones told us earlier that it's experienced it allowed us to click today so you don't forget that right\nWell that makes that type of experience has to be like given the time to flourish in ... and practiced\nLike vertical passing it has to be put in and you have to put those guys down the field at a bar and say quarterback your first read is this guy yeah down in the field [noise]\nAnd I think there was some opportunity even today that we didn't take advantage of even down in the field where a guy like easily there was a couple of places there why so easily was it it may go had made a movement was open ... in just Stanley dismissed him within a series of his progression so this is still some opportunities there but\nThe trips when I Love the fact that we're stretching people Berkeley I think that's been an open up some think intermediate leap or it's between the line back from the state each\nAnd uh I think that's going to be very beneficial going into a really\nExplosive\nOffense and defense with Indiana coming in next week\nI tell you that scene thorough easily that was incredible that's what I mean that was a heck of a throw it but it right on the money just in time before the defender coming across the field was able to get there an absolute picked a thing on [noise] yeah I was a big jump through\nWell that's one where you sort through him mhm right you got to get it there quickly 'cause it can hang out you know we don't want the floater over to the left let them do that yeah we saw what happened when you do that [laughter]\nNot good things that the drug regimen quarterback I'd even they're picking on him all day long and then it\nThrough one of those up there in March ... in the

you don't know what the difference is going to throw you into the game time [noise] um so what did I was running the ball we had read those games whether it was you know if you're on the ball is every possible and you know it's changed a\nYou know I think we're screw up\nSo they didn't plan to do it Minnesota kind of forced him to do it when they took away their own but I Will was capable of doing it\nAnd Stanley finishes the date twenty three thirty nine three hundred fourteen yard for touchdowns you did have a sack of course and he did have that nasty interception that really put I Want a bad spot down there on shadows his own goal line inside of two minutes and the first half which every single\nA person who thinks that one off to sit on the ball and never run the two minutes real will hold up forever if airport why didn't that in the end no I only ends up\nWith the forty eight thirty one victory to plug stuff happening here in fact Wisconsin is taking it to Nebraska and\nI kind of

you know the the programs in good hands\nI've just got to talk something out they were talking about can I Will go undefeated through the rest of the year what you mean they've finished Lebanon one right yeah they do that and don't end up in Indianapolis\nI write and yeah how do we accept that\nJust were talking about expectations [laughter]\nWell I mean that's what everybody was worried about two weeks ago and it you know you got to win or lose the west title of the first gave it a season well\nYeah which I live in Lebanon one no reality\nIs is that you don't know where that one or could help you or hurt you\nYou just got to go out and play the game to the best of your ability I think we did that you know the challenges that we're faced with some of them were random ... you know you can't say that this thing last us that game right you know and and that's that that's what's great about college football\nIt always reminds me of what are the great march cook told me years and years and years and years ago which is you know really winning or losing a football game is how the team deals with what you haven't planned for\nMe and like a downpour of rain like just lamb well and maybe a three hour and forty five minute wait time between three minutes to go to first quarter and three minutes and seconds you go into court\nRight [laughter] right that's right [laughter]\nRight 'cause he says they'll be a lot of things that happened in that you planned on\nYou know some of them will be things that you did someone would be things that are going to you that you expect but every game is going to be five or six things that there was no possible way to plant on to practice or to expect maybe even to think about it and how the team response to those situations will determine whether or not you win or lose the game\nAnd over the course of the season whether you're not you know you end up in the playoffs whether you know you end up in the title game and whether or not\nYou wind up

wouldn't go to her over the church where they would so the whole thing was is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who jak roaring which are home sided than\nI have all reviewed it they didn't know he did not have been refuted what'd you say you're in colder no more Mr White guy I'm going to I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is you have a trope hitting left last has lost its collective mind\nAnd we are we seeing that with ... we really are\nIn and I got to tell you I don't know I'm I'm kind of dumb in a mostly white although my skin is much more Italian all of a I'm a white guy and I'm watching it in Ford is white and blue sweat Nick is white\nAnd there are white men on the left or asking questions and they were really mad at Blumenthal good lawyers face off he was really mad at 'em all these people everybody involved with the story's what except for Deborah Ramirez and we can argue about whether Hispanics you're white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has been a cliche for some time hum I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the fact of um he has an odd funds for white\nAutocrats I Do remember that no I Know yeah so okay\nCast your mind once again we're going to think about actual fact your cats your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been white authoritarian rulers\nWell I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I Would move my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats authoritarian rulers in in in the far east\nUm I guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly style one he's even Khrushchev right but she throws and that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just\nIt's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um\nIt's really bad why\nIt's so bad because of his white news is getting colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left or media\nYou've got to understand they have all these white men would be questioning this woman the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to a woman there's been some discussion but you'll be centers who happened to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand why he's there is so much anger\nWhite men and so much guilt in white men themselves that this crap works in\nUh it hasn't worked on may nor me and I I go out as I Am I'm Still a white dude\n[laughter] um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean I at least understand the logic of saying it should be women women understand massage any and that should be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time um that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women wasn't when they pick the OJ jury\nRight because I remember that was Marsha Clark big idea\nI'm black white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson right on didn't work out for oh no oh I guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should they\nShould be questioning that actually don't you have all these rape laws as Janine bureau said right\nBless her soul she said but you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean\nI just don't feel when he wrote about America he wrote about how the ... the crime of rape in income ... even ... you know other European countries which was what he was familiar with\nThat the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds to murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is ally of\n'em and it has always been ... wow American women don't know what they're asking for if they want you to throw over the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nKnow it really has been in culture but even the book is resistance as you tell how the Trump painting left lost his collective mind she's written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors a pass and you see the blood evidence always showed that the troops that are being him or seven billion to one\nSo there is a it was it him go through on the\nBottom line is and I'm going to ask you about this before we run out of time I ask you about Jeff Flake look if you're in charge of this committee why is he still there when he says I'm not running for reelection when he says that I'm outta here what do you make so much noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad winds that guy that we still want to be a limit on the Judiciary Committee do you have any clue\nThat's a really great point Republicans do not think seeing these things out strategically Republicans are used to being over just going to you know the gentleman we're not going to say\nI'm strategize um and and and look I Love 'em this week but don't get too high on Lindsey Graham run he's the sort of Republican and takes the position well if I keep voting for Democrat nominees just even though I Know they're going to be total disasters on the court maybe maybe Democrats will reward my\nGood they never happened never\nMade it looks to hurry you know you got to start thinking about this and advance guys\nRuth Bader Ginsburg Ninety six to three she was confirmed think about that how radically left you use and you write these people like Lindsey Graham in in the late John McCain's vote that they were gonna get paid back\nThe pay back to screw you were not going to allow you to do it and it happens every single time it's colder get the book resistance as you tell how the Trump hitting left lost its collective mind last question does he get\nConfirmed or not because there was that about him being rapists any more about him being an angry drunk\nAnd ...\nExactly right and he's drawing and I used to be with somebody in\nYour holiday would go with anything that is so obvious that this is unfair I mean I Can't think about anything else I I I'm outside I get splashed with a puzzle I think I was going to affect cabinet\nI wake up and that must be how um you know Hillary\nSupporters felt the day off and you write our side is not going to let Republicans given this time I tend to say yes um I think he will be confirmed and I would
