media the legacy media in this country listens to what she has to say and it's like now given her greens if he hears the odds then\nThen the whole thing is odd but was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody is presented as an expert on something like I'll have an\nAuthor on are all have a geologist on are all have a an actor on it and I'll say this is an actor you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator\nUm the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for the parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking remembers getting paid too but they keep on presenting Alyssa mulatto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on USA Today I'm confused why are we doing a story and a list of a lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy for and what have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she's not an expert\nI talked about this while I've talked about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them a list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYou get the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me to buy you into this far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't up their side they think she does but she doesn't with Louis I'm a lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb ... the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThey don't misunderstand me and I said it's from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe it once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or you're you're ... you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we shouldn't believe or you should believe it wasn't a lot I'll be cause fill in the blank\nJust doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ...\nRobbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost\nAnd had to surrender to to us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod and their story and of course that's the only period and a story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kept his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you will know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised will Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes\nBut it's also a sin of omission or reliable mission they didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert The lead and left and waved to the crowd ... it's the best thing ever going to go to my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\nA better thing to say might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good vetting kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context but why tell

for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened\nAnd and I show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and or do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska but or lose gentlemen boys and girls who served Sarah how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday because the people know I was actually this was unfolding on me or live you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew\nWho said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and eliciting just want us to a good point they submitted you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise [laughter]\nSick\nAnd going back and forth now and I needed\nSomebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot in yeah Ali yeah thank you for doing that and it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Los Angeles and I don't know what I'm trying to verify me\nWell I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll is just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to think of the faith you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all trying to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the but you took my face time in ... well that's definitely her son Tina Fey that's her that's all I I Know you've got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day Sarah have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nMe I don't even\nWriting campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what your Senator Frank were kept you after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he gave his daughter that job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on charming and I ran against him into heated rhetoric that we've got and that's how we stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have a special interest from around the country right up funding you you know you\nHave to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding\nThat that that vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as you an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you know you or your wife wasn't up and I sort of a court of appeals at all ... opinion of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska\nAnd just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going to write of my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every week it would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that share um what her\nAction was with essentially bolstering the night circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous another thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is allowing Adam are only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nOkay we're going to do that as Sarah thanks a million alone with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate you reach out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much\nWe appreciate Sarah bail and taking the time you know it was interesting how we\nEnded up connecting she's riding around in Alaska and listens to

against Lisa Murkowski\nLisa Murkowski in my opinion do not represent the people of Alaska which he voted no on Brett Kavanaugh um the reason she gave was\nBecause he's not the right guy at the right

we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well uh ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know taxes but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa to be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back\nOver Indonesia where did you know that that was going to entail all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is\nThe energy revolution runners odd that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continents group\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs are obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and has a uh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied\nNatural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's ... he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nLeaky you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade them in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make it part of the bill how does it go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a\nA a role to play in that and\nAnd so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nAnd I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true but it's true\nAnd and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I have trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals or he comes with some really hard stuff made me think about with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs and retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know the heads blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese no they'll lose a trade war with us so yeah\nI Know because we're the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the guidance of a\nGreat job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it is these things were outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side that was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree\nUh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and\nNow I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so makes abundant good sense that the president would say you know what

didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson wrestle your last question on cabin on the moon to be on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their money for we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell is there an angry mob and ... they\nThey'd been they've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of hunting room there's some you know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure\nThat never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race did Wisconsin let's talk about the an Affordable Care act you supported the president as it all Republicans and I was doing all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and\nAnd this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helped people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that taxes are you an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations and\nGetting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care planning ...\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act reverse rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three sixty four days which is they weren't or a bomb you and then in addition to that allow companies to offer Reno ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right\nSo the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you could always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the Han care exchanges we're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay that no this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because Romney want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects aren't preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh

some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever the financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the managing director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams of associates or Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJoe I'm great thank you so all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market is a slot machine anyway so I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is things that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs it off and then suddenly it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested\nHere as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough a a photo if you will in in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have a video ... senior vice president over at the gym and associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation\nTarget of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was when President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they're they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of a I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational depicted politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger\nYou're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right except for things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay uh each they'll gambler he's managing director ... vice president of a investments are even dreamed of associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look how great I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubble bursting for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles gonna burst\nThis can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for its britches\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people either think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fats in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is that\nService so that's just simply what comes in and income or into a household and then what goes out for a ... student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because of the doubt drops eleven hundred points well it's not affecting my spouse\nThat's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat",
