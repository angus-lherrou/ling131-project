[laughter] we rented already said man yeah secluded Trevor Trevor wearing a dress which I was thinking of the back of my mind earlier this week with all of its Indianapolis talk I Wonder if Lew and I can talk them into that again if I were ends up back\nThere and it has to be man you know we already had a loss there in the end of the ten title game not oh are we already outlaws and ... that's that's a special thing going undefeated favorite [laughter]\nSee how he ... I Know and I noticed that I Am\nWilling if I got to be the right type of thing and when you go big time and get undefeated I'm good\nLet's got to be special is what you're saying ... million Cedar Rapids is next on the outside for cat Hawkeye holiday Billy what's up\n\nBill going once\nI mean hey what do you think well that sounds you guys doing a great job thank you\nUm you know I'm a big Hawkeye than but um I have to label this uh this part of the show a question will play calling um I have no idea why they'd be passing the ball and that play\nFirst down in the three three yard line now why would you pass the ball at all in that play 'em and I just said in a play written for half the time I don't really rent that crazy play why in the world when he put the ball and that like you know just a couple of questions I had you know I just don't think there's any way they should pass the ball Napoli go ahead\nMy question Billy is do we know what ... are are you a hundred percent sure what Stanley checked out of that passing play\nNo I I sure don't know\nYeah I don't I don't either and and we've kind of established I guess that the Iowa sideline was calling time out and\nAnd the fuel judge for whatever reason to follow through on it but I think that's what I heard you guys say earlier wasn't it that you were both thinking this is I Will football we're going to run it for ... and her own if we don't get in Trevor fine they're better than we are ...\nYou know what kind of funny the way coach parents you know when when when the running back home all the ball he's gone he's only ... you may not see the light of day the rest of the game right\nMhm yeah like where do you know\nWell yeah but who is going to pull let's say he thought about pulling Stanley and the fourth quarter after he Watchmen sell at the end of the first half not run the play\n[laughter] yeah well yeah that guy [laughter] guy he got a point there are you [laughter]\nSee there you go he already had his chance to gauge for us that he didn't gave him right yeah [laughter] sometimes are better off\nJust fallen down you know he's better off just falling down on that plane went down right [laughter]\nI hear you I Am [laughter]\nReally thinks of checking into three six five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty ... start six hundred I'll be here like this game couldn't give started any better for Iowa right\nI Will maybe take some more chances that they haven't taken to try and create a level or an atmosphere of being comfortable but [noise] if nobody's going to get mad\nLou then maybe you can yeah I mean I have a huge man oh well\nYou really don't want you don't really don't want salty Lou I've been trying\nTo normal after ...\n... yeah yeah well I you know as fans you know a certain level of expectation that and even as\nAn alumni I mean we we want you to come out we want you to play like a true ... and I know these guys are going out and they're competing every single week um and they're not going out deliberately doing that I just wants to be a little fire in your belly man\nYou know and [noise] I mean there's an acceptable I I just to play better than that type of thing yeah I think you've got to have a little bit\nMore you know um [noise]\nYou know be upset that you lost the game now I Will offer this from ... who may be gets a little closer on me Walter seated hunting post game microphone to what you're wanting to get ... to hear from him and from members of the same [noise]\nThey will [noise]\nSo we just got to pull together and bounced back [noise]\nOr maybe I won't that's okay because\nI think everybody's on the head of the right direction so hard but I think we have a really good team really good team chemistry so like you said we just got to pull together and ... well\n... well I don't I don't question that they don't that they're not playing together team now question whether or not this is a good football team I'm questioning the fact of\nYou just gotta be in the game that you really should have won and you're not giving me enough\nWell you know I'm I'm I'm I'm\nAngry I should be upset I disagree I mean I just don't I don't know this is a big deal we set out to do with the start of the season is it is not transforming why why why is that in and that would make me\nWork harder that would make me it would upset me I guess that's twice\nIn eight games where\nIt's been on the table and the fourth quarter and we haven't taken it we've got to get to the point where we can take these things and I don't agree something like that would be what you know yeah yeah\nI mean the team actually that would be\nThat would be actually refreshing um interesting enough like you know there there are times where you've got to play calm be cool\nBut there are there are also ways to express desire to be more than you currently are and to not have given up this game with out you know getting past the line\nAnd that's I think when we were looking for and that's what I'm looking for you know we had it in our hands we let it slip away that's frustrating\nThat flight yeah against teams that are of the level of caliber that we we are yeah well we think we we should be hoping to be ... your past the hope that was that that was our goal to be at that caliber\nIt was it still is I mean we can't go we've got no slouches right coming up well we've got no slouches coming up so unless we keep on thinking about hope and and all that other stuff we better go and figure out how we can get a little a little fired up\nAnd uh ... and go and put this ball in the end zone and and do the Little Rock\nAnd stop it oh Trevor with a motivational um and then but it's true I mean you gotta you gotta explosive producing I Know they got it today but they got us will suffer new thing coming up you've got to North western team is coming up yeah I think they're going to play in Indianapolis now [laughter]\nAnd then you've got to Illinois team that would love in Illinois in Nebraska tune that would love to knock off Iowa at the end so I mean at the ... we got to get fired up man and just\nStart knocking people in the mouth as there is I think they'll commit experience they can play fear ... are you guys his point of whether they are able to learn from mistakes\nYeah would certainly be nice to hear a little bit more of a of a level of disappointment I guess following another\nLoss that should've been a victory well it's five or six hundred and eight hundred three three two fifty for a one star six hundred on

the ground without you having some control over it and this is Rob but then I mean I think we spend too much time on this\n... yeah yeah it's it's really difficult because you got to find where that where do we draw the line at I mean and then you know\nWhen we're we're saying hey this particular play it may not have made a major difference in the ball game but maybe cut up so where does that

also about what is this new tax cut plans we keep hearing about Kevin appreciate you how are you\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on the uh what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to give it to the incredible succession the\nPositivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good\nPolice law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history of uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do you know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to drink much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nLike a low on right now he picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know ...\nBut we are in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and he said you know some ... stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin worried about House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him a demographer bomber they're calling ... ... people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSanders shooter or some yeah why why is there a double standard here have\nThere is and I would say a joke I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only a few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing so do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out Steve was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about\nFour minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here and and and I guess my frustration is\nWhile they blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often hum are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged incivility or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is that the year where frankly President Trump or can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished\nTo what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan\nPerhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and the United prosperity\nAnd rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nIt'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I mean up two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with\n'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no\nManufacturing stuff here again or promising yes to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that suggest as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou

should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nAre they are good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people and I said absolutely

drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked a disabled reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms worry I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or reported something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of been as he ended his similar fashion and made you know spoke at a at a certain kind of way well either guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter uh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he used that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research and independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter and then you make\nBut if you buy hook line and sinker went to fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squad an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact to do more than I Do\nWhat you failed any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in his business Fifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics were\nSo bringing next time I get a little bit you better bring it better than\nAll right let me get to John Hi bushy who's the guy that runs the or the Reagan pursued the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate ...\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I'm really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind you just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on could
