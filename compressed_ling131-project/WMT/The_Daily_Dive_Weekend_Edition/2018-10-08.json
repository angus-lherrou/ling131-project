{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "I Know sometimes people will run with those but really we need people to be able to hear what's going on around them especially if they're out walking or riding their bikes and again be aware of their surroundings so\nUh we say to you know put those devices down keep them in the pockets and just to keep your head up and pay attention when you're walking especially when you're crossing streets I'm you know you should be watching traffic around you because a lot of times you know cars could be driving and the son could be in the driver's eyes and they might not\nSee a person that's trying to cross even though you're in the crosswalk and you're doing the right things so I always say you know when you don't when you're on a bike or when you're walking you don't have that extra protection around you like the people inside cars and other vehicles do so you have to be extra careful\nDo you ever get the question what to do ... bullied or do they come to primarily maybe after your discussion or a does the topic of being void ever come up\nYes we do talk about bullies in third grade and the fall so we watch a video we talk about what bullying is we talk about different ways to deal with bullies and I really try to\nExplain to the kids that you know someone comes to them and says I have a secret I don't want you to tell anybody but I'm getting bullied that that is really not a secret to keep because that's not helping to person at all and that bullying needs to be addressed and they need to talk to an adult immediately and if the bullying continues after that and they need to continue talking to adults until the bullying stops\nSo you know we talk about basic bullying in third grade when we get to the end of the fifth grade classrooms of talk a little more about cyber bullying and then you know and middle schools were actually developing a new anti bullying program with the Cedar Rapids rough riders that we're going to be rolling out later on this month so we're really excited about that and so that'll be a middle school program\nI put a bench and things change so quickly now that to you have to take a look at what you're addressing a year to year basis and make some modifications in your presentation the classrooms and kids\nWe do yes we have had to change our presentations and you know take some out it's very hard to [noise]\nYou know replace presentations but we feel like we need to keep up with the times and make sure recovering what what the kids need to know and what the kids are being exposed to and so that's why we added this Internet\nSafety presentation and fifth grade a few years ago we added a gun safety lesson and second grade or in the spring we also moved around a few classes but yeah we really do try to keep up with what what the kids need to know and what we should be teaching out there to keep them safe\nOr start a little bit of on Halloween is coming up a trick or treat ... ... are going to be the end part of the month of water or some of the general safety rules that you like to pass along this is good for parents and kids\nYes so first of all with trick or treating we do want kids to go out before dark and families of course we never want kids along we want them to go with an adult again\nAnd you know stay in their own neighborhoods are neighborhoods they know make sure they're only going up the houses of people they know are people that have lights on or have those um [noise]\nHad those signs that they are giving out candy if it's totally dark in the house then that's not a a house that should be trick or treat it out and staff have shown on average children more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year\nAnd that's because so many kids are out and about and they're running all over they're excited about candy a trick or treating and sometimes they get out into the street and so we want drivers to be extra careful as well and have their devices put down have no distractions they need to be paying attention at all times like they should be\nWhen driving anyway but you know even the radio turned down so they can hear if kids are now yelling or screaming or laughing close by and just be prepared for the unknown sometimes\nAnd costumes on and polar costumes I Would imagine ready to her deal especially at this time of day\nYes so we really increased\nThe kids to instead of wearing a mask to use face makeup instead and that way say the mask on that's really going to limit their vision and so they're going to turn their heads the chat for cars before they cross streets\nAnd saw a lot of those masks do not allow for that so yeah we want them to have reflective tape anything that will make them stand out bright colors\nTake a flashlight but really they should be out and hopefully back home before it gets dark out anyway so if they can play on their out and and make their Halloween plan so that they're back home before dark that safest [noise]\nUm we say they can also take low sticks with them just we just want them to be lit up and be seen whether even if it's not dark out yeah just anything extra can help 'em make themselves more visible for the people who are driving and vehicles\nIs a good idea to put on the couch through my head of Halloween because then you you mentioned some safety features and I'm like not having a mask and that really\nInhibits their vision and field of vision but it is it a good idea to put the past month before the night of Halloween because then you could see if there's a safety factor or two in the particular ...\nDefinitely yet and if they put it on and on now with say the cost him as too long because they don't want them cutting over you know the bottom they're if they're wearing a skirt or long pants so yes definitely that's a good idea to try it all on first and make sure they have everything they need but also make sure that they're going to be safe when they're out on Halloween\nOkay parental guidance or at least a going out with an adult very crucial especially the younger the kids are\nYes definitely so we always want kids out with at least a parent or some adult you know if you have a neighbor that's taking a group of kids out that's better than\nAgainst somebody just going by themself in that same thing goes for kids on Halloween just like any other day of the year if you're by yourself you know a stranger is more likely to pick on you then if you're in a group or with an adult so yes we definitely wants to adult supervision\nAnd um for people who are handing out candy we don't want them to invite kids into their houses they should either be standing right out their door outside their door or even some people put a a bucket or a tub of candy on the porch and just say said please take one\nSo we don't want any any adults inviting kids into their houses during Halloween or trick or treating time\nOkay ah if anybody has any ah information uh obviously it's a something that you want to make sure gets a\nA distributed to the entire community ah what's a good reference point for them if there's something up on line or do you recommend that the uh uh give us a call they have a question to the police officer at the regular number not the emergency number\nRight yeah they have any issues are suspicions or you know anything that make them feel uncomfortable on Halloween they can call our non emergency number three one nine to eight six five four nine one\nWe also have a Facebook page however that's not monitored twenty four seven but people can send messages to that um that Cedar Rapids police department on Facebook\nBut again like I said that's not monitor twenty four seven so if it's something that needs to be addressed right away we want them to call the dispatch number so that dispatch can send an officer out right away\nOkay and and definitely leave nine one one for the true emergency that needs to be responded to immediately\nYes yes exactly\nOkay well thank you Shannon we really appreciate your time and here's where a a safe for school year as well as a Halloween\nI think you're anti have a good day okay you do the same officer Shannon Sampson she's with the Cedar Rapids police department this has been ...\nSuccess Joe\nHere's Kris wedding\nFolks who knew Marvin knew he was quite particular about his food and drink\nThe Washington man worked hard all day in a paper factory\nSo when he found time to relax everything had to be just right for example he ordered his drinks with ice but he hated handling the glass since that maybe I smelled\nSo large tried using a hollow strand of wheat grass to suck up the cold drink but the grass had a funny taste\nThe next day at the paper factory Marvin created a hollow tube of paper the world's first disposable straw when other people saw him using it they all

card bills no student loans no car payments or if you've never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless or overwhelm from living paycheck to paycheck\nBut you can take control of your money you just need to ride plan financial piece universities to step by step guide that teaches you how to never worry about money again you'll learn how to make a budget that actually works save for emergencies get out of debt\nSo we're still nothing on fire ... ways away from having to worry about this year you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at the job and find out you have that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in here might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the how you've been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through his you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head\nFrom the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly and out of all rushed out of almost a desperation and emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail here\nOkay and so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and\n... good and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't learn that yeah that's probably about twenty twenty thousand\nKind that has not bankrupt all\nRight okay and do you have any IRS debt no just the um foreclosure on the house okay and what type of a home loan did you have F ha VA or conventional\n[noise] um I ... it was started off fresh Fannie Mae but then it got I'm told in finance and I'm at this point I don't even remember what it was okay\nIt's possible that they're not going to trace you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand and it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy\nTo see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again\nRight starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay if I Am able to start paying off but that we do the best way to go from ... to largest where\nI Would love to swim smallest the largest and I would call the smallest one of the subtle with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and then I Would set of what the next one for ten to twenty cents on the dollar ... meanwhile I'd get my student loans going on a basic payment plan that's all after you're back to work and feeding your kids and have lights and water and my life to live
