I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where did you get your values are those private sale values are wholesaler a dealer offer what\nAre those are trading values okay so you could sell them for more than that possibly yes how's your credit oh no you definitely ... you saw it for more than ... ...\nValue I mean you saw it for ... on on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nI heard your oh this money to these these two Carlin's where the loans\n\nUm I Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit for a show you've not got any easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all in her name then\nYes uh-huh okay [noise]\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nAnd so if you sold the Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty\n... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the er the deal and the Eighteenth probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two shows problem walking around in the hole if those were trading values I'm not a ... year only about six and the whole here\nUm that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had of value of a hundred ten thousand dollars\nOkay\nAnd when you're in the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd by our by you try to sell it for ... I'm going to guess and say let's say for instance it would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless spot three thousand dollar car with\nThat OK okay\nAnd um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrowed the difference\nFrom the credit union in your wife's name\nWas her credits and I get your three thousand or a car and I hope the but she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with a student loans but you're making one twenty six so you can do that and\nWithin a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up and car once we're out of debt and have your emergency fund in place\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years of time\nOkay and that gets you clear but you know your car poor\nYou have a car mess on your hands you're right to observe that and um\nYou know had a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though\nYou're going to make a little hot last on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run ... Carmichael profit they don't they're not in the break even business there and the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this\nDiscussion easy if not more the difference in trade in value improv a sale on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nDoing very good um I Am here I did buy your book here in the whole program with them by it currently Iran I've got a way I look at you by I bought at you and then that total moneymaker\nFinancial piece book and the total panic over book okay\nAnd I am Seventy thousand American mhm at night and cutting and cutting out right now and I felt I work at night crave a I have great now thinking about Seventy I like to be I'm a ... thirty and then I think it's fair to say yes\nI'm right now I failed I kind of at minimum payments but I Do not have a thousand dollar phased out\nMy name cry air it's um I had like go out for ... and I should have if I had an ally ... not not getting any money or anything like that it back and forth\nI had like a ... quite a thousand dollars and I I live in a category\nI now now it's time to read the books that you bought\nThe book the book the total money make over will explain to you exactly how to take your baby steps\nAnd I'm the first thing we're going to get current with everyone and get on a written budget you don't have a detailed budget yet you've just got a little got a little list that you've made but you don't even got car gas on your list yet so you don't have an adult budget yet you need to do that it's an easy way to do that is go to\nEvery dollar dot com and download the app for your iPhone or your eye pad or I'm Sorry your iPhone or your Android or you can put it on your desktop and it's free to use every dollar\nAnd every dollar will help you put together your budget and about ten minutes so the first thing is to get a detailed written budget that you do a new one every single month\nThe second thing you've got to do as a part of doing that budget you have to have your husband involved you have to be an agreement if you're not an agreement and both of you pulling this wagging the gather you're going to get really tired of pulling the wagon by yourself\nYou have to have unity you have to have agreement in order to win with money it's almost impossible to do it with one spouse by themselves\nSo a budget that your spouse and you both have looked at and you both agree to on every dollar dot com now when you've got that and your current with your bills the first goal\nIs to save a thousand dollars lost sight of thousand dollars and pay extra on that\nJust save a thousand dollars but all the money you can squeeze out of your budget into that baby steps on until you get a thousand dollars then maybe step to you'll read all of this when you read the total money make over\nIs you start lifting your debt smallest largest and you attack them in that order and that was this hour today Ramsey showing the bugs will\nBe back with you know in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's why I'm daily and Jesus\nWe use the phrase heart of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorse agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a Yale be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E.

intermittent or hell has sixty thousand dollars and what we would call her retirement\nFund and then about six thousand at a checking account and that retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay a rental house maybe basically been given her all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that's become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not as focused though it go it often goes without a tenant\n... steady money coming in [noise]\nI've been wondering you know if you have a recommendation oh maybe a better um consider an investment may be a limit in pain or just a mutual fund or get your thoughts on her\nAnd her financial um situation as her net monthly is about two fifty and the whole when she gets her Social Security I'm after she pay their rent which includes an independent living with meal that three hundred two to three hundred a month and we've been chipping away at her checking account\nOver the past few years now five pound only six thousand ... that's about to start hitting a sixty [noise]\nOkay so the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah for about eight years okay now you've got that\nAnd that's invested in want\nIn my brother's one of my brothers rental property\nHow would you want and moms money it's not employ\nAided liquidated he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving our all the rental income\n\nOh I see okay and so her investment that she has made in this rental property is not doing well because there's not being managed well\nCorrect okay um and where is the property\nIt then it around jak Tennessee So she lives in Memphis with me and you know it's there and my brother is in his home town but it's still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think the ban and thought\nIt would be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent right\nAnd that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in paying five she think that\nMore no ... no I\nDon't think it's more secure safer because you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks in the grip and I wouldn't get into that um I Would like to take a growth in income mutual fund\nAnd a balanced mutual fund put about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and just drained the growth off of it and they should run in perpetuation in to the tune of about five hundred bucks a month then\nAssuming you sixty out of the sale of the house but yeah sit down with a good mutual fund advisor to you work with one\nOf my company uses fidelity so they've been\nPretty you know they don't work out with a financial advisor then your company is\nYou're talking about your right one K. and stuff okay All right yeah not just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's are just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income\nThan have to generate a lot she's only couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this house is really poorly managed\nYoung don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in ... but the last year and get fed and\nWhat kind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um are checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained are checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah then let's cash it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds and let's walk through a child wouldn't do it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition",
