getting checked out for dementia or if she's in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying stuff so I put her on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff\nWhat is your income um she makes ... about twenty eight thousand a year\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it now and she's kind of destroyed it I'm sure\nI'm where's your mother and my own apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house yeah so\nWhat's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\n... can't drill [laughter] she's on a date I Can't for\n\nAre you on the deed\nMore phone line how did she get on the deed [noise] um my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to live so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying the is your mother paying the mortgage\nShe's not any more I was it yeah I told my sister I was not any more you know everything everything's in my mom's mom all the utilities everything as\nTake 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell utilities off because we're coming your indirect in the ... and her name [noise] um she has says that she can't because her deposits too high mhm\n'cause she doesn't have to pay her bills so they raised her deposit too you know compensate for that\nBut you can see ... to pay the bill right yes okay just to pay the bill that and that's it\nAnd she used to pay the mortgage today Yucca rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes\nAway yep guy so we don't worry about those ... paying all she did that we're paying the students that equipment in student loans so now I got eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nDoes the rest of it we're just not paying\nYour mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dimensions you're most twenty eight thousand dollars a year she sixty three years old you're living in an apartment we have to make sure she's cared for first and that is food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say a car and here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I say no you're the power when you're earning yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollar car 'cause fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right she can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the problem she forgot how to get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes before she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee\nFrom Wisconsin and we'd have one of those silver alert sure whatever they call them right yeah yeah\nI think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\n\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to\nDo your job as the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care\nIt's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOK\nSo all the student loan people they get ... up nothing nada\nOkay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what why ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he had ... pounds on it in her security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nI was I was in the high paid fifty on laugh on each one\nAnd it's okay if you won't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks settles a whole dad or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to\nSue her do you know what they're going to get nothing because you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attaching annuity\nAnd so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr and Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets and are only income his pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that on the atomic bomb and agile coach and he said they are judgment proof okay\nAnd uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by of I'm not trying to hurt him by I'm trying to protect your mom and the last\nThing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rant and she is taking care of only then that we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying that's real kind of like\n'cause I Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you\nYeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay that way you can do it\nYou can do it if you need some help you call me back but just just play hardball with um Tom ... oh my goodness for the story [noise]\nThere's a reason to save
