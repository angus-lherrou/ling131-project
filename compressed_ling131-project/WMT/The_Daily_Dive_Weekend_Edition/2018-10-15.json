premiums\nAre right\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nExactly I\nSo there's no also or they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nBut they're taking ended up getting\nYou know it's hot sorry is my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight and I like to know what the candidate you know policy the rates are low and you know\nI Know and when you die you know what happens to those rebels in dollars they're going to keep\nIt now they are going to keep\nIt so how is this good idea there is no way this was a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those qualities are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles I'm Matt how are you\nA fabulous ... thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage and my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were I did not include the property taxes on modern association and the insurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away\nThe property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance that your way no but most people as you know we're paying that as one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there's no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house\nOr okay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but at the council twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinance your hair long one\nOr you can ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nNot sure we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape right now you gotta clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a six thousand\nDollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke\nYou know Hitler the whole the whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the uh in our senior splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be\nHouse pour that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in Jackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off really quick I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that I or\nI found that a day or that including my mortgage and out of access that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house or to save and buy\n'em all at least have further down or if it would be ideal pet save a container KKK say their life weights country every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I now I Want to ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house\nNo ads on for this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical need a base getting what I what I have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just didn't have to add on an expert brown and check on kids I work with children I Am that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part is a\nModeling as somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYeah and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are and how much of that his mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAh there's only three thousand in that and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nAnd you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead for a you have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't wrap myself by and I know that we plan on eliminating the access that like a sex line yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying about falling out plus I'm an extra fall now me clean alone was like\nI mean I actually felt my eggs if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's where I'm kinda ... I just I Want to do with that\nNow that's under such a simple question if it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from\nToday is that an okay ... plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I led\nGood yeah I think you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid off\nEverything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become debt free and then I Would save up an add on to my house so more than twenty thousand I'd sure you get contractor beds and\nI'd everything down and you know what you're getting into that puts this hour that I Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know in the meantime remember\nThere's really only one way to financial peace and that's the woman daily with the prince of these crises of\n...\nHey Sallie Mae than we have the same as the force\nHas to be here thank you for\nHelping friend the way [noise]\n\nWe use the phrase part of a teacher to describe our real estate ... because we only endorse agents who care more about helping their clients that are earning a commission\nBut you don't have to take my word for it here's what Paul one of our listeners from Boise had to say about is a Yale be part of a teacher is the perfect description for Matthew the E. L. P. I used to sell my home\nHe helped me through the frustrations of working with an uncooperative bank and addressed all of my concerns in a respectful and compassionate man or a display great integrity and did what he promised when he promised he would do it is positive attitude and infectious spirit\nLifts everyone interacts with your E. L. P. far exceeded my all ready high expectations about can we take our endorsements seriously\nAnd we only recommend the real estate agents who will far exceed your expectations go to Dave Ramsey dot com and find a real estate he'll be in your area\n\nAnother debt payment that means no credit card bills no student loans no car payments or if you've never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless are overwhelmed from living paycheck to paycheck\nYou would be a renter was an option to purchase the house for the loan balance for a number of years until you get your other debts paid off now much all the data you got\nOnly got fifty four thousand left on their own\nOkay right\nOkay so she moves out you move in and run it you sell your house oh how much you're much equity we'd go your house\nUm maybe Fifteen thousand not very much at all\n... up to a little bit ... the payments not too high that doesn't bother me a when you ... what's the ... you have any idea what they're afraid is on the loan\nUnless her she writes refinanced about um two years ago I Would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to show me you could get a mortgage that was a version more rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on embed restrict three but it's going to get a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions but this was not a bad\nAnd you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nBecause if you say no now she needs to just sell the house right\nNow thank God so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nBut you don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to win it for the payment and we want a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\nUm there is a brother\nIn and get on a by going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this equity given to you\nKnow you sure as far as I understand that now there\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pile and talking about this this is how families end up not speaking to each other generationally okay so yeah we're all going to talk about it and we're going to do this in writing I Want you to lease it with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance\nOkay\nLisa for the payment with an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like your rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just show it then and that's no different to her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\n\nDoesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if there's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe I'm probably given Iran at\nThis and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay personal finances\nPersonal and that doesn't mean it's situational e ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item you know that a car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not so in that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway about three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I was about the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference in the both of them are car both of them are sitting in the driveway both of them are transaction that needs to occur\nBut we're going to factor in you know that there's something real ... about the connectivity to the item and its reason reasonable people would acknowledge that can activity you cannot do personal finance without it also being person\nThat's why people don't get out there who don't get mad enough and you got to get ... getting mad person I'm sick and tired of being sort of Darwin makes so much money how stupid or we were about to change our lives and see that's partially\nJust real stuff\nThis is today
