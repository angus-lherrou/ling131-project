{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "You know the ... some things that I've noticed about team Dr remember we probably take for granted when you're being driven every place where they are before they get their permit her license\nThen they may not be aware of just the street way out and how to get certain places it's amazing amount GPS is the technology that could be utilized but\nThat I've heard stories of parents with tea and saying you don't know how do I get to the mall where have you been to the mall so many times I've driven you there but they're not paying attention to roads and you know what in each road\nIn a highway across the city have different uh kinda wane reductions are driving restrictions that type of thing it just seems from a geographical standpoint that teams have to kind of get that at a kitchen when they are also learning to drive is that correct\nThat that is and that's a really good point you know we we used to say that your kids really start learning to drive as soon as you turn the car seat around because they're observing you and they're they're watching what's going on a that's not always the case anymore and you know if they have their tablet or smartphone there they're looking down there listening to music they're not really paying attention\nSometimes that may be a plus especially if you're you as a parent are setting the best example of of how to be a driver but we really do encourage parents to to set a good example for you know and drive the way you want your team to drive\nA and then even before they get their permit to begin engaging what we call commentary driving where you make sure your king is is\nPaying attention and you start explaining what you're doing and why as you're driving in the road if you're changing lanes if you you know begin breaking or something like that explain you know what it is that you saw or observed\nUm that that made you take that that staff or or you know use extra caution so that your teen is is already getting into their heads space of scanning what to look out for and what kind of a new version they would need to do in different situations\nAnd they also have to learn about the car itself to and and I it changes I mean adults need to do this too because there's always this new technology that\nReally in some ways it it really increases the safety when the vehicles on the road but there's you you got to know I'm OK here's my emergency break what do I do and these kinds of situations\nAnd everything from the breaks to uh in having just the insurance card in the glove compartment there's so many things that you have to learn about the car itself when you're not even on the road for teens\nThat that is important to any you know we recommend everyone have some basic knowledge of how their vehicle\nWorks um you know the different features in their vehicle and even from a mechanical standpoint or so that they could you know address the simple issues on their own\nUm when it comes to break down on the side of the road though we still always do encourage of course you know our members you know they have their car to they can call for assistance\nAnd it's important to remember that that assistance doesn't just help them address the mechanical issue in the car it also does help create a safer environment on the roadway because more and more we hear about really tragic incidents of\nOf people that are struck by distracted drivers or impaired drivers on because they're they're pulled off on the side of the road I'm trying to address an issue with their vehicle and someone else coming down the road doesn't see them you know because they're distracted and and we have injuries or in some cases fatalities and so having a ...\nYou know our service vehicles come up or even you know contacting law enforcement if you are out off on the side of the road and letting them know where you are so that they can come and help set up a safer perimeter or or safety zone for you on the side of the road by putting on their lights and creating more visibility for you\nAnd just as simple as knowing where the pleasures are if you do have to pull off so you are a ton of alerting other drivers that you have a a cart issue and you are are off to the son wrote let's talk a little bit about distracted driving this is almost a given\nBut the teams love their technology in it here again another area where adults don't really shine all the time either I mean and there's so much technology in there with\nThe actual phone itself and then there's also the technology that's maybe they're utilizing as GPS or something like that up but you really need to keep the focus on the road especially if you're going at a higher speed because things come up also politically it doesn't take much distraction time before it can become an issue\nThat is scary yeah I mean that I got setting a good example\nAs a parent is critical but also talking to your teen about the importance of of not utilizing their phone\nBehind the wheel um and then setting up some guidelines and there are some more resources coming online most ah cell service providers are as well as even some of the the platform on makers like apple and Android have set up apps um that\nAnd restrict the ability of the phone to send and receive messages are calls while its sense of the vehicles in motion are we a AAA have a great resource for our members are called triple a drive that they can actually use to sign up to get an insurance discount but or they could just use it as a way to track\nI'm driving a ability and for their teams they can also use it to track\n'em you know how well as their team doing in terms of uh excessive speed heartbreaking on one of the things that the ... it's it's a ... platform on their phone and it can also monitor is the phone being utilized while they're driving as well and that's another way\nThat parents can really monitor and again it's something we as parents we struggle with giving your teens the freedom but also keeping them as safe as possible but again remembering that it's not even just about their safety it's about the safety of everyone that sharing the road\nWith them and if you want to have that conversation with your teen a good place to start as a resource you know where the parents can share some information\nWith the teen teen driving dot ... dot com or that your website correct\nAbsolutely there's a lot of great resources and it's\nUm and research and and the site is actually set up so that there's a version of it for the parents are there's also a version of it for the teams and we're we tried to present the information or in a way that that you know it's a little easier for for each of those groups kinda specifically targeted to the different preferences and and\nWays that are those groups use the Internet and and receive information\nThank you for your time we really appreciate it it's been a good information and it just to really if you had to take away one thing from this particular interview you would say teens connect with your parents parents connect with your teams because\nAh it it's their safety it could mean their life\nAbsolutely and we thank you so much for for giving us the opportunity to spread the word on this\nOkay ... who is director of
