a ... distribution that is mainly in your middle and your waistline as opposed and your hips and dies for women and for men that conveys an increased risk\nAnd so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens as we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important is activity especially post metropolitan\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if there are smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is this such\nUm deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and for osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong\nSo physical activity is great [noise] the other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out and walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduce the risk of heart disease from the nurses how study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise as some of my patients do do you feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life so I think\nWomen are so busy and one of the things so the the answer is yes but okay but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture ate it to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there was a mom's at work and and so often when we ask women even who had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthier exercise\nI don't have time 'cause I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time because none of us have enough time to do this thing's its priorities and\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention\nOr there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day what's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually greater or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefits at one hats\nAnd the stomach bleeding mainly endemic\nAnd other types of bleeding because it it tastes the stomach but also you can get bleeding into your brain and women and everything we do and every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women alright fish oil\nA fish oil is very popular hum a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office and they're on fish will ask why are you taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell them to stop it is yet because it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefit or really even secondary prevent what if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish so I'll just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help okay so the recommendations is he finished a couple of times a week\nIt's not harmful but people who are also on blood dinners it ... if you take high dose fish oil it actually can than your blood more than I Am a less is more I go through every patient list I say why are taking it while you're taking it while you're taking it and they say I don't know I said then asked the doctor who prescribed it for why are you buying it and spending your money out of its over the counter\n[noise]
