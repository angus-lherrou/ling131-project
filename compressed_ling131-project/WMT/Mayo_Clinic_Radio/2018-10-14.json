it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and we did that\nAnd so it's kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for

need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine\nMonths we did not do it\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone
