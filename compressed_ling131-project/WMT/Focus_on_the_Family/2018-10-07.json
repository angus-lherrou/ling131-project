denied\nRight and kids are feeling more pressure than they ever what's\nA good thing for a mom and dad to think about that a little healthier perspective that way that it's healthy to have idle time\nIt is absolutely healthy to have I ever growing up ... times ... times horrible but actually some downtime is really critical\nYes and to pay attention I mean that's what you were saying what are you noticing in your child and they're going to tell you that there ever stimulated but it's often get to be and that's one of the things I was kind of going towards the things out of it comes out of anger\nTypically for girls and boys and so you will see they're going to respond in a bigger weight in the situation warrants and that's when you know something was happening and how can I kinda doubt down and figure out what it is\nThat's good advice I liked the boys and girls develop differently obviously the culture especially the elite culture wants to kind of dumb that down that we're all the same that it's just a matter of inputs in society that cast those kind of but science is pretty straight on this our brain chemistry is different\nThe processes in which our brain a sinks in response to outside stimulation is different [noise] describe for us those differences between boy and girl development\nIn terms of emotional development a great example would be that she will have a more expansive vocabulary period so she's going to have a more expensive\nThan it is\nTrue yeah and I'll take them out or we can pick on the females\nThat she has more words she has more vocabulary so her ability to express to articulate hurts me which is going to be advanced because she's got more words to work with\nAnd in addition to that one of the things we know to be true as she is advanced abilities in terms of reading the emotions on others so she's habitable you going to be ahead of him oftentimes not always are certainly exceptions to the rule\nBut ahead of him in terms of empathy because she has advanced skills in terms of understanding what's going on inside of another person yeah there are two examples right there with\nA different method to girls being a verbal more verbal typically the voice struggle with the expression and when you talk about an emotional vocabulary how do you help boy what age should a parent begin to help a boy\nBecome more capable in their vocabulary to express their emotions\nWe recommend early on from one year on be using a feelings chart and and it's the starting point that when we're using emotional words with them were referencing a chart and just pointing I felt sad today and I because I think I heard a friend's feeling I felt embarrassed today that dads are talking in front of boys to say\nI felt embarrassed today I had to give a presentation to the board of directors and I didn't feel prepared\nThat those words are landing on kids and I would say for boys they're seeing that\nEmotions reside in the life of a man that is what it looks like\nAnd for the listener who may not be grabbing what we're talking about social typical charts that have a happy face and angry face and you have your child points\nThat they're feeling if they can verbal express Edmund hopefully down the line they'll be able to verbalize it like you said that's what we're talking about\nAn end to understand accurately what's going on left to his own devices you on this with teenage boys you know their feelings chart would include boarding annoyed\nThat it's pretty much if we get out and figure out what's underneath what's really going on and so they knew and figure out where there are so many cultural influences that seemed to say guys don't feel or guys are angry with kind of two extremes right yes and we are quick to push into\nThat meant to say it's not that girls have more feelings she just has more vocabulary she is a\nBetter ability to articulate those things so that's why we have to labor a little longer I Love your work concentration concentrate on that space with boys that\nWe've got a labor longer in that space so that he develops an emotional vocabulary and\nWe talk about how these milestones build on each other parents are so quick to want to go to I Want my kids to figure out how not to melt down I Want them to figure out how to work through frustration better and that's an important objective but if they don't even know what they're feeling like that's the foundational building block that's why we start with vocabulary we've got to figure out\nWhy does it then I'm feeling so that I can and figure out what to do with it\nSo you have all these um obstacles and the culture in in the home and in your make up your personality or gender plays a role in that\nHow do you begin to counteract those to um work with it I guess would be a better way to say it and provide building blocks\nOr that the child like the emotional chart you know how are you feeling today let's move that up to five years old when they are a little more capable of expressing themselves a sissy with a little five year old girl what are we going to do well\nAnd it's interesting 'cause boys have a hard time expressing which is our first mouse that in perspective as a second one which would really be regulating and that's where they struggle with it more as in the regulating of their mission because there's so much more aware of it and and I've started one of our building blocks that we talk about that\nActually born out of counseling with girls I started doing something called a scale where you know we think about um lessons on the one to ten scale and you know having children yourself some of them just lean toward ten on everything\nSadness anger embarrassment worried that they live at ten and and because I work primarily with girls I call it a ... on the monitor yeah I I could use one of those yet\nAnd so what I Will do with families is\nIn a calmer moment for a child who live that tend to have the parents say to them tell me what a ten with the on your scale you know what's the saddest are the worst or the scariest thing you can imagine happening and said they name that early on just like we're talking about naming our feelings and then when the child gets in the car and says this is the worst thing I've ever had in my whole life\nYou can say gosh that sounds really hard 'cause we always want to start with empathy that sounds really hard to tell me what number you think it was on your scale and then that some automatic perspective that that John in particular doesn't have\nTo say I don't want to let go of this because again in your book the stumbling blocks that you identify a for girls in addition to the one you just mentioned like the pressure to please yes that's a big one at a the pressure to perform and the need for control\nI mean I I most women listening right now are going yes I still struggle struggle with those things 'cause that and again it's not to this merger demeaned this is just wiring issues you know and this happens\nAnd that's such a big part of it because I think as we talk about net it components that from the earliest stages girls are kind of defined themselves against this backdrop of relationship and said that need to please comes out of that is born how do we\nEquip our daughters and at what age and again I Want to move kind of the age continue if you can carry it all the way through from a three or four year old up to sixteen Seventeen year old\nHow do we give our girls equip them to avoid the pressure to please that if you can achieve that as a parent in your girls that is a milestone in a city that is an incredible achievement how would you go about that just take us all the way through\nOne of the things I talk with parents of girls of all ages about is a combination of kindness and strength\nAnd how often we lean towards one or the other that we either just don't have a voice at all and so we don't ever stand up for them to ourselves themselves or were really strong and yet these strong boundaries and were unkind intimate step that and so\nTeaching girls from the earliest stages to say things like I Want to play with you but not when you treat me like that\nYou know how different for a woman that in my adult relationships would be if I learned that at night or at ten or at fourteen what that looks like in a friendship I Want to be your friend but I'm not going to continue to hang out with you when you're posting like that about me on social media are when you're relating to me and\nThat really is the strength to be able to say that they feel safe going on there and wait to adult express how give me a practical example of how you would do that at age eight are you taking your daughter's side if you observe something and say hunting here's a better way to handle that\nOr if she comes June tears because she was overrun by a friend gave me an example of how the players are\nMagic formula we get you over and over our empathy and questions that sounds really hard what do you want to do about that what do you think would help where it's her voice starting to say this is what's going to make a difference and were empowering her rather than when we say\nI Want you to go right back after and you tell her she doesn't get to tell you then all of a sudden we're saying you can't figure it out\nI'm going to tell you what you need to say if you don't have it inside of you that's really credit we want her to feel like she's got it\nAnd that really is true all the way along that continuum I talked to an age was at the same question let me let me ask you this day but when it comes to the boy side of that you know these things that we just expressed the pressure to please the pressure to perform the need for control\nWhat's early in the boys' development that would be similar to those things but more boyish one\nOf the first and biggest obstacles for boys is going to be\nHis hardware and we're kind of back to those differences and I talk early on about how emotions for a boy have a lot of physicality to them so it's white toddler age boys are so prone to\nBiding kicking screaming teenage boys are so prone to punch in a hole through a wall yelling moving toward disrespect and so part of what I Love to do with boys and parents are boys is helping them understand that's a normal part of how got hardwired you like you need an outlet to channel that intensity that physicality so with\nToddler age voice for example I have twin boys when my sons were\nThree years of age we we purchased one of those Bozo Bopp it's like an inflatable something was saying in the bottom where you could punch ... felt that it was going to the ground and springs bad yes and it would bounce right back up and\nEmotions charges well all of this that focus some family dot com slash radio or you can donate and get resource\nThis is when you call the eight hundred a letter a and the word family on

I'd rather not talk about a gym I have to answer the question I have it in and says the welcome back thanked me what you got to be that now David Thomas you're not the guy that invented the Wendy's hamburger I Wish I had that in here and I just want a better connection\nUm we uh ended last time talking about uh you know the impact of data and the daughter we talked about boys and how they respond to mom and some of those basic things identifying the stumbling blocks as you called them\nI'm In ... talked about a control of a little girl what she's developing their kind of the insecurities of that wanting to be perfect that idea of perfection\nAnd again if you miss that get it I Want to come back to that briefly on the anxiety side um and this can be both a mom or dad but when you see an anxiety and a child what do you normally see in the parrot\nWell there's a lot of research that sad things out of your childhood epidemic in America today I think from are counting as we would say anxiety is panning epidemic in America today\nIs the parenting epidemic his parents are the ones who are anxious and we're transferring it to our cat\nYeah yeah and some of it I think is really ever compensating that I think we all are kind of near the same age and we grew up in a generation where we weren't talking feelings\nAnd our parents were often asking us about our feelings and so maybe we had anxiety no one ever name and so we're seeing parents who are over talking with their kids and\nAnd really trying to step in and fix it like you said and basically what experts will say is with anxiety to work through it they just ... scary thing and so when we don't ... them or in effect preventing them from working day but they need to do it in a gradual lame but they still got a deal sure\nGive me a handle I'm a mom or dad David you can jump in on the bad side here what does that handle for a quick self assessment that I'm dipping toward anxiety how do I see it in myself with my child\nOr what would be some of those uh experiences if you're doing this then you may be um in forming your child and an unhealthy way\nAre you doing it for them or are you stepping in and written new thing whatever it costs and anxiety and if like if it's track are you letting her quit the track team immediately without pushing through and having to work to it a little harder\nDoing homework do and how we're going to school out of family recently had a lot of kids in school or are these are where they're worried about going to school and\nAnd there are ways that you can help them work to do that without just pulling I'm In a family who completely pulled their daughter from school and by the time I got with her it was obvious she was in complete control of our house huh\nAnd that's part of that if they've got to know that we're Baker that makes them feel safe like\nYeah David what about boys in that same way do they suffer from some insecurity or\nOh absolutely they do and I was even thinking when you were asking that question my parents where I mentioned earlier with boys I'll do a lot of training around listening to your body and figuring out when your body signaling an alarm and I have to do a lot of that with parents\nLike we laugh about how often what here in our office who will say things like he so worried and I don't know where that comes from\n[laughter] really challenge\nParents hopefully in a respectful way to just say like are you where even right now like your voices elevated your hands or clinched at this point you're yelling as we talk like not listening to signals your own body is giving\nYou the reason for my questions that are self awareness can be really diminished in this area of parity because it's so close and we're going to be far more self aware in a social setting in a workplace but at home we're kind of just two we are oh that's where we're relaxing at least in terms of facades when\nWe talk a lot in the book about panning out alive and not out of fear and I kind of the bottom line yeah\nThat is so true and I think the key thing there is what I'm trying to pull out he has had as a parent do a quick self assessment that I Am a fear based parents and I've got to change and I know there's no quick way to do that but I'm just thinking of the poor mom or the poor dead listening who's saying okay I think I'd do parents out of fear\nHow do we confirmed that for them ... what would you say\nIn the chapter on awareness we do talk with parents about the importance of not only knowing your stuff checking your baggage but talking openly obviously age appropriately with our kids to to be able to say things to them like you know what\nI have a tendency to bent toward catastrophic thinking\nI go quickly to worst case scenarios and so being able to say those things telling ourselves in that way and understanding what do I need in response to that like we've talked about empathy and questions and coffee and case though the third kind of magical question we talk a lot with parents about his time and space and to be able to say the kids we love you know what\nI'm amped up right now like I'm flooded with worry right now like in this moment\nI don't feel like I'm In my ... with boys that caught your dinosaur brain or you're thinking brain you know your emotional brain you're thinking brain for us as parents to be able to say I'm not I'm not thinking brain right now I Love you too much to argue so I'm going to go take Fifteen minutes to walk the dog\nDo whatever I Need to do at this point and we'll come back together and talk so that I'm not parenting out of fear so that I'm not parenting out of emotion when we're emotionally charged kids or adults in those moments it's like what happens when I go to the grocery store and an empty stomach I just I don't make an awful decision\nLet's move to empathy talk about the importance of empathy what empathy is in teaching your child how to uh express empathy kind of a big question there but we either one or just kick it off\nMaybe a short definition would be a vocabulary demonstrative vocabulary reading emotions empathy is responding to emotions
