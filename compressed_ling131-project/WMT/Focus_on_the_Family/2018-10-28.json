M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nSunrise soon on a city that saw little sleep I'm Del Walters Fox News day one on one of the deadliest days in Pittsburgh history a little more than twenty four hours ago Robert Bauer as a lone gunman opening fire inside a synagogue killing eleven and wounding sick [laughter]\nAnd I took that was a hard choice and it took more time and Roger it'd be a little upset 'cause she thought she then something great and I had to say like you know you did do it but that's really not the standard and it really is just in that moment got really taught me like\nThis is going to be the case we're always going to have to teach them to raise the standards like you know short cuts and know like just because I got it done but did you do it the right way because you had to take away\nIn terms of the culture today yeah\nDid you grow up flipping the puzzle over yeah I mean that's the metaphor for life parents that make it easier too easy for their kids they don't challenge their kids to think differently or to do the tough stuff so that was a lesson she remembers that\nShe remembers that yet and socialize because I was like me and this was supposed\nTo be a quick look and instead it was a half hour but Johnson you\nOr you saw your daughter may be a different daughter I'm not sure but uh in the book you mentioned how you could see her moving from knowledge of God to a relationship with God yeah every parent raising a boy or girl a we're interested in that what was that experience and how did you see that in your daughter\nYeah it's actually my oldest girl who's now fourteen and um there was a neat experience because I prayed for you know all of my life and then even as we got married before we were pregnant I prayed for my children and just pray that God would just\nDoing what he did me and um it was neat to watch my daughter she had actually just come back from camp and just share with us uh that should give it a left a crisis how old was she ... she was probably eight I'm guessing and uh\nSo we are actually a church service and um they did alter called she'd already told us should go to Christ and you know if you go for the Christian home and you really like for me is I don't remember ever a day not knowing the lord like I gave Melissa Christ on several occasions several different church services and all that right like\nThere was this clear um I think broken is I think in her where she was realizing what God has actually done for like she knew it knowledge wise but there was a clear broken and she had on the Sunday and service just as we worship at some yeah and I was just shocked at I'm just the vulnerability that she had that moment and she was in tears tears just cry and\nThose are real heart exchange not just a a a knowledge sharing\nAnd I asked her I said is everything okay and she said yeah and I said to or your tears happy tears are setters and she says happy tears\nAnd I mean it's been really since that day she was baptized shortly after that but it was really since that day that we've I mean she's not a perfect world by any stretch but the reality is I've watched you have a heart for the lord of the cost her I'm just a ... to see come in relationship to see can with all over too\nWell and that's what's so critical and I think as a parent that's what we want to see in our children is ... how are they responding to the gospel we take 'em to church now if you had boys you'd quickly learn the church is boring\nDad I mean really we've got to go to church I guess so that's usually the not enough action figures version of that from the girl so yeah but it ... Kennedy's principles that I really\nAppreciate it in your book she is yours um what are some practical ways to bring God's word to the heart of your family yeah well\nI Would say first it's just getting them into God's presence so for us often times of the family\nWhat are the things we've really tried to do and um I mean I learned this as a as a kid myself listening to focus on the family but just the reality of just spending time in God's word together as a family so whether it be the dinner table or before bed or in the mornings\nI mean we start our days every day with prayer and we're always intentionally trying to get our girls into proximity we can't really get them in the relationship with God but we can get them in the proximity\nAnd it's their choice to choose the relationship but\nI'm just spending as much time as we can intentionally bringing them into the proximity of God's let me ask you this question\n'cause again and John jump in here with three girls have your own uh for me you Jean and I will often have this discussion about raising boys and\nYou know instilling in them a spiritual lesson in a moment usually means you're actively doing something with them you're on a hike you're driving somewhere and you just start talking about a spiritual application\nIt's rare I think being a father boys to actually be able to sit down after dinner and say okay we're going to have a thirty minute study and don't fidget in you know Boyce just they have a lot of energy physically and they've got to be moving usually in order to hang with you\nHave you found that different raising girls do they set for you do they are they a little less ...\nNot at all\nAnd we said I'll you know like you know family devotion and I'll have to clarify like it's not like this pretty\nSit down search service you know where John ... a little message and we got a scripture written up ... ... it's not that at all any it's chaos and it's you know so it's the end of the day they had used to get you know had to sit still most of the day right actually did it they are wired\nAnd so it's not pretty and it it it's not fun and sometimes it causes us to you know we read the script you only like a week I did you talk you actually try to teach us something right now but it's just something that we still feel that um the importance of\nDealing in our prayers that grows will see the ... that it is for our family and that that becomes a priority for them because of the one that's why\nThe focus on family broadcast will continue in just a moment\nFocus on the

online part when you stop with that marriage as parents and families fries you can learn\nOn the family dot com slash store\n[noise] thanks for listening to focus on the family\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program\nJonathan being a father of four girls\nUm how do you express heavenly father loved to them\nTo help them identify with their life in Christ so often we hear about absent fathers or know fathers at all and the detrimental impact that has on girls particularly I think both boys and girls obviously but girls seem to struggle with a healthy identity then and we so often here\nWhen they grow up to be teens they will look for love and all the wrong places looking for that father affection\nDescribe how that can really\nCommunicate a heavenly father image to his girls yeah well first I Would say\nThis really what what I Try to practice is just presence I think president is more important than anything else to literally being there being there in the moments when they're happy being there in the moments when they're sad being there just as many moments as you can be there you'd be there and what I said be there it's not just be there like you're in the room but it's intentionally\nLetting them know that you hear them that you see them that you value them and it's difficult for all of us I mean I talk about I think in the book a little bit on this reality like for me I Love listening to radio talk radio conservative talk radio liberal talker I just love listening and just hearing people's perspectives and\nSo it's easy for me to put my ear buds in his own cleaning the house from moving around and just literally to ignore everything that's going on around me and I had to make it intentional or effort to take that your buds out and just be there in my home you know what I'm doing dishes or when I'm sleeping a floor are just\nThey're just being around so I can hear what's going on their lives and aside from presidents and just being intentional I think it's tailor made a depending on because all of our girls are different having four daughters I Know that\nEvery girl is different 'cause my four are absolutely different from each other every one of them\nAnd they all received of different ways so just being aware enough about what sparks them what makes them tick\nUm you know from my oldest daughter she really doesn't need a lot of conversation she likes to be in the room she likes to sit in my lap she likes to you know it's really just being there for my second daughter it's a lot of interaction she's very talkative she wants to tell me about her next genetics moves and she'll be the gymnastics move them at me help on that next to ... so\nThere's just this reality that there are different so like if you have more than one daughter it's really you know telling making what you're doing with each of them based on their personalities and based on what you learned because you are there and you are aware of what's going\nOn again the point being that critical love connection so they see a father's love and they can understand it and we hear so many of the negative stories where it didn't happen and it causes a a young girl to go off the rails you know and that's a good thing for dads to respond\nSmall for an eye on it and I'm not done it perfect by any stretch and one of the things I really love is having not been a perfect for fourteen years are just recently just this week I was looking at um article that somebody did on my twins at their school and they said who is your hero and they said my dad something like All right I'm not doing it perfectly but I'm Still they're heroes\nThat is\nNow once you're on the mom's side you were a little girl [laughter] so you can share the struggles with them how do you approach in cultivating kind of a spiritual attitude with your daughter's as the mom\nYou know it's interesting because even just going back a little bit to what a Johnson was just saying about\nGrowing up as a little girl without a dad that was my story I grew up as a little girl without a dad in the home and so even as um\nMothering my girls I'm seeing guy do child like I owe all over again and so that has been on a neat experience and so when it causes me\nIt's just it's the same thing just being president\nI'm a little more understanding what the emotions and some things 'cause I remember being fourteen our number just you know being ten and eleven and and all those things but really being president listening to them knowing it that like letting them know that they're hurt\nTime nice to have your long today I Want to start by sending a big thank you out to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural they're one of the best sources of high quality nutritional supplements at
