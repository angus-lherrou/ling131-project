has to do with the new helicopter parents of twenty Eighteen they're called lawnmower parents because they mowed down all the diversity\nThat your children could go through and it makes you ill equipped to be a a really good adult so to talk about this story we talked to Justin wash them he's the host of the dead podcast we started off talking about what he does on the dad podcast and then get it all into the lawnmower parents\nTo adapt podcast is a Internet radio show for parents who feel like the art of the mindset of where everything is puppies kittens rainbows we talk about the struggles we talk about the pain I have commuted guests on who talk about their struggles his parents\nAnd then I also have experts who come on an informed the listeners and let them feel a little bit better about their parental struggles\nThat's great so it's not just you rambling off about how much your kids are rational it's Ninety\nPercent that but we also throw some you know yeah it's a fair split\nLawnmower parents there's all sorts of classifications or you can be a helicopter parent a free range parents tiger parents but the lawnmower one is the new one what is that\nBuild on it from the helicopter reference because that's what they did a helicopter parents are parents who were just always there right there always around they're involved in everything that their kid is\nDoing the difference between a lawnmower parrot and a helicopter parents is that a lawnmower parent is their and their entire purpose is to try to clear a path and make things easy for their kids to do\nThis came from a viral post that was made by a teacher group we are teachers dot com they somebody made a post and describe a scene that happened she said she was doing prep work for her class she got a call from the front office said he'd pick something up for someone so students\nWhich is like All right it's probably lunch money and inhaler something that they critically need and ended up being a water bottle that the dad said my daughter kept texting me like I Need this bottle I Need this bottle he's dressed in a suit ready to go to work assembly and he had to drop it off so the daughter had her special water\nDespite their being water towns all over the school\nRight and then they started getting comments from other people my favorite story was it somebody that shared a story that a parrot asked somebody at the school to be made available to blow on their child hot lunch so that it would cool off faster\nThat's something that you should be teaching your kids when you're sitting down to dinner\nIt's very easy that were breaking it down right you think well this is how you do it because\nThen I remember my parents doing that right yeah but it's it shouldn't even be a topic of conversation oh here's the thing I Will be the first to admit that I understand the intuitive nature of trying to make things easier to protect your kids the thing that I Am learning from not only just my own experiences but the experts that I talked to on my show\nIs that for some reason I don't understand why yet the more you work to make things easier for your kids the harder adulthood becomes for them but they don't understand what it takes to deal with negative they're already finding their studies have found that\nIn fits better exposed to tablets struggle as they get older with dealing with a negative experiences and negative emotions because they've constantly been pacify\nThat when you look at it from just a purely biological take psychology out of a biological standpoint when your\nBrain does not know how to deal with just being bored\nThere's always something available in our technological world to distract me from whatever negative experience I may be experiencing that how can you learn to those neurons do fire they don't strengthen it to me it's the same thing is why we had to do a hundred multiplication problems right to learn your multiplication like you had to get the reps of doing that\nNow it's as easy as flipping your phone open and your calculators there and corrected so with ... mom more parents just to kind of in this part of the conversation\nWhat advice would you give to a parent who feels like they're doing it's like I Want to give my kid everything I Want them to have a happy life I don't want them to feel struggles and pains what would you say to them if they're struggling with it's like I Do this too much and I don't want to do that\nIf their kid is like it below four or five is you could just start to make a shift and just reset boundaries because they're just going to follow along\nIf you're dealing with a kid who's a closer to like eight ten maybe pre teen\nThen you need to have a sit down with him and say listen things are changing because I don't like the way that this is going and just shoot straight with them because they get it the kids are very adaptable in fact I've talked to a therapist on my show where he said the children are adaptable to a flaw like even children that exist in abuse they just adapt to that and accept it\nAnd we think that kids can't handle things and it's just not true especially when you're calm and cool and collected and you sit down and go listen to this is how it's going to be but when you set that expectation don't move at bar it has to stay there because their whole wiring is going to be to try to move it for to see how far past\nThat they can go and the more you to stay there and you're going to lose it right you're going to lose your your temper that happens to even the experts say it happens to the best of us it's all about how you deal with it afterwards you don't always have to apologize you're not always in the wrong if they did something wrong tell them what they did wrong\nAnd if you're dealing with the teenager it's got to be a bigger struggle but it's to me it's that much more important because they're about to leave the nets hold rally and build their own life and so you got to say listen\nYou need to start doing your own laundry you're going to make your own plate and you're going to start doing the dishes and started helping out around the house being a part of this community and they're going to push back but you just say if you don't like it then you're going to lose these privileges that's that's my advice yeah anyway I Would\nDo it with them and be very communicative All right that's great adjusting with the dad podcast dot com thank you very much for joining us thank you\nThat's a really good advice coming from Justin and I tend to agree with it a lot I'm not a parent yet but I often imagine what I Would do in that situation Miranda and my producer you're joining us again here and it's your turn right now you have a young daughter what do you think of this whole notion of lawnmower parents\nShe's almost to sell a lot of the staff he was saying it seems like it applies to older kids that I was able to recognize some patterns in my parenting style and behavior that I didn't like\nOnce I heard how they can potentially affect the kids and they get older 'cause it's so easy to hand to the phones that she can look at pictures of dogs when we're in the restaurant right you know or so since we heard this interview earlier in the week I have changed my parenting style and I do limit her I had time and I switched her off the bottles already ... now\nYeah I think that's one of the biggest problems that parents face across time right how to control your kid in a public setting you don't want to be embarrassing you don't want to\nHave your kid or you know to take the ire of other people you know it's a complicated thing me when you need to discipline a child in public and giving them these phones I patches is like a thing to smooth out a way so I Know that's one of the things that\nIs a vaccine for a lot of parents but do you see yourself possibly becoming a lawnmower parent where you're taking all these challenges away from her\nI really don't because outside of handed the phone to keep her quiet in a public place I really do let her be her own percent we'll\nCheck back with you next year and see what kind of a parent you are that thinks that's ...\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nThat's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily diet every Monday through friday

M. S. guidelines\nThose that are reimbursed by medical insurance those things that are recommended by people across the nation and yes we should only be screening people who've smoked within the past twenty five Twenty years\nOn some program say within the past Fifteen Years people who are older than fifty five\nPeople who would still go for treatment so if you're eighty nine years old and you would never want to have any kind of treatment there's not much point in getting screened\nSo what are the surgical options if you get screened and you get diagnosed with an early lung cancer you are very likely to have a lot of options out there that you could have if you have a really bad lungs you have COPD smoked your whole life he still might be a surgery candidate because we could do mentally invasive surgery\nWe could just take a segment of your lung out which is only five\nPercent of your lung function and you could do quite well\nIf you're younger like fifty or sixty years old you have good lung function the standard of care has to take a whole load of the lung out us three lobes on the right to lobes on the left removing a whole lot with all the lymph nodes as what we call the standard of care or the gold standard\nAnd if we do that now we don't have to cut the chest open we don't have to cut the chest wall the muscle and spread the ribs and break ribbon anymore now I'd say about\nSeventy five in Ninety percent of the time we can go in with a tiny cameras the size of my index finger in three different little ports between the ribs and do most of the surgery for patients who have lung cancer sometimes even if it's growing into the chest wall sometimes even if it's gone to the lymph nodes\nWe can still offer patients mentally they have lung surgery that makes a huge difference and the amount of time they spend in the hospital yeah dies we actually just did a study that's just been submitted to one of our big academic groups called the society of drastic surgeons and that said he showed that patients who get mentally invasive lung surgery\nUse less opioids when they're in the hospital which is a really hot topic right now people are concerned about getting addicted to opioids they go home on less treatment they don't require as much pain medicine and they tend to do a little bit better and there are tons of studies out there that say that\nThe more patients go for chemotherapy if they need it\nThat you can do it in older patients who are traditionally considered\nNot really good surgery candidate that there's a ton of patience and we can now offer surgery that maybe traditionally would not have been offered surgery just because it's less invasive and people can\nTolerate it better [noise] we've been talking about lung cancer

another news skin rashes are common soaps detergents plants and other substances can trigger red itchy skin Dr Don Davis the Mayo Clinic dermatologist says these types of rashes can be the result of an allergic reaction or an irritation knowing the difference is key to getting the right treatment\nDr Davis says it's important to differentiate allergic contact during the tide is from irritating contact during the tightest now allergic dermatologist means of substance is causing an allergic reaction on your skin but irritant contact German Titus means your skin is inflamed from repeated exposure to something\nFor example if you use lice open your skin over and over again you may develop an irritant contact during the tightest simply from eroding away the natural barrier of your skin with the repetitive washing\nIt's not always easy to tell the difference between an allergy or irritant so it's very helpful to go to the health care provider especially a dermatologist or allergist to help differentiate between irritant contact dermatologist and an allergy that way you can properly treat the rash and prevent it from happening again\nAnd they're kind of network TV and William [noise] walking back to the Mayo Clinic radio I'm Dr John ... and I'm Tracy McCray\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurologic conditions affecting about three million Americans two thirds of epilepsy patients get some relief from medications but that leaves a million people who continue to suffer from seizures\nAt Mayo Clinic a new approaches being tried for those patients high tech brain stimulation that was developed an approved for treating conditions such as chronic pain and Parkinson's disease is showing promise for epilepsy patients to\nAnd here to explain his male clinic neurosurgeon Dr James and gospel welcome to the program Dr van ... thanks for having us\nWhat causes epileptic seizures\nThere's an awful lot of different causes sometimes or genetic causes um most of the common causes that make it to a neurosurgeon nor causes and have a spot in the brain that's just acting radically and um and ... and a lot of patients we can actually treat that spot but we're here to talk about his patients that were not very good at finding that spot\nAnd as we think about the different types of seizures that people can have you talked about there's different areas either the whole brain or part of the brain we can address both those with non medication therapies are\nSo so years ago you would've said no okay um and there were some palliative options but this this particular therapy this deep brain stimulation for epilepsy kind of starts to fill in the cracks of that uh the way medications worked to ... to kind of control seizures are called the seizures\nIs that they just changed whether the how the electrical storm happens in the brain right doesn't happen if we slow hauled electricity goes around or if we make it go faster that changes whether or not the likelihood of a seizure occurring right\nThis particular therapy brings electricity to the brain and the same way as medication is due to try to either slow or quicken\nThe the way the circuits work in an attempt to try to reduce the number of seizures and hopefully with a reduction in seizures for ah reduce the chance that one could die from the seizure which is called screwed up\nHow do you identify which part of the brain needs that deep brain stimulation\nSo there's a standard area that we treat it and the elements for those and um we've been doing this for a very very long time here at the Mayo Clinic we'd been treated in one part of the thalamus for patients that have generalize onset seizures which\nAre some of us believe actually come from a film is itself this particular therapies for patients that have a spot in the brain that's causing the seizures\nOr multiple spots that we're just not good enough to find at this point in time or they wonder why multiple therapies and\nI always say you know is is the juice worth the squeeze on these patients who are you [noise] they went through so much to try to find a spot and we don't know well fortunately this type of therapy actually fills role for those patients to to have some success and potential procedure freedom\nHow is this similar to um using deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease\nIs exactly the same the the electrodes everything has been going into people for for over two decades or so there is no safety if in terms of difference in safety there is no different devices that have been going in for that for dystonia or or\nTremor what's dystonia\nThe stone is a part of the body that's acting Beth so it's constantly either contorted and sometimes painful\nA treat a lot of patience with epilepsy in my practice and you know one of the things they struggle with is what should really be the goal um when we think about the brain stimulation and some more advanced interventions are they looking for no seizures are what are reasonable goals to for patients to expect in terms of outcomes from any kind of therapy we provide\nYeah and that's a really important to understand the expectation that procedure up front to 'em for this particular procedure the a large randomized controlled trial was performed for it\nThat showed that in patients that underwent this therapy that were resistant to multiple other therapies between five and ten percent became seizure free for periods of over six months which doesn't sound like a lot but for the five to ... percent of patients that's quite a a I'm a big deal\nHowever we think of this more of us a palliative therapy in terms of ... patients that we\nDon't think realistically they can get to meet a seizure freedom we think we can reduce seizures overtime so fifty percent or more that looks like between fifty and sixty percent of patients will respond to this therapy and those that respond to it the interesting thing is if we follow them over time they continually get better by having less seizures\nAnd that's something that we're just starting to understand what these narrow stimulation therapies is that they may be narrow restaurateurs and that over time if we can just stop some of the seizures\nWe may be able to get better and better seizure control of medications\nIs it true that when we look at kids who children for example who have seizures long term that it's more damaging for the brain you talk about this sort of neurodegenerative thing we always we always think about the reason why you don't want to have seizures all the time is because it can actually cause some level of them is that true for kids and adults\nThat's the prevailing theory is now is that one seizure maybe get another\nAnd it's probably true that this isn't really a static state it's more of a dynamic state meaning that as you have more seizures maybe the seizure onset area grows over time because of that damage that's created by either local lack of oxygen to the brain are just too much electrical activity there's a couple of theories are on that but I think it's true that\nThere's damage that extreme drinkers\nWhat our risks for epileptic patients using deep brain stimulation\nThe risk of having a major problem from the procedure is very very low it's\nThan one percent chance of having to bleed or something like that and the good news is is that if it doesn't work it's actually reversible procedure with removable and the intention is not to hurt something with it\nIn enough patients wind up for the east and the patients are provided this device do they have to worry about things like travel and metal detectors and CAT scans and memorize\nYet you could still go through the Fisher the metal detectors at the airport do you do have to carry a card like you're doing some of the pacemakers um but I I think you know for some patients that depends on their their lifestyle so\nA lot of patience choose a battery that's not rechargeable because they don't want to think about having to you know get to that energy source once a week and and and and they actually feels overcharging the battery which is an option with some of these\nReminds them of their problem the batteries typically are replaced around five to seven years um and return to a better as we don't know\nThe really interesting thing about it is that the frequencies we use are much much less than the common therapies use right now for movement disorders which they stimulate about two hundred and ten sometimes a hundred and eighty times a second\nFor this war between five and forty so you can see the battery life we expect to be probably two or three times and you said that right I I personally don't show it was more than others so but right now you know like all things that may or it's a very collaborative practitioner them\nAnd it's true that sometimes those programs can mix seizures worse and some do better\nAnd it's it's really an a collaborative experience with the patient and the doctor trying to improve things\nAnd it's a lot like medications I Know a lot of the epilepsy patients that are probably listening out there they they've had probably the experience of taking medication as well that's worse than their seizures\nAnd it's it's a following that seizure diarrhea and in in those types of interactions with the position here the nice part is that the the stimulation itself doesn't have affects over the rest of the body I tell the patient said the stimulation is trying to do the same thing medications are doing what you're not getting that tremor those other problems that you have because it's ... it's directed\nAt one particular spot in a if you could give us much medication to control the seizures unfortunately they would have substantial side effects from soliciting says all the all the seizure medications probably work full time\nWe've been talking about deep brain stimulation being used to treat epilepsy with Mayo Clinic in ... thanks for joining us off if you were going to take a short break and when we come back Dr ... switched to the expert chair and we'll
