{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Right okay so if you came a\nYou know you'd be at about a five year plan if you were a little under two hundred thousand right thirty thousand divided into two hundred thousand right rather than it would be um six years roughly if you do the full two hundred a little over two hundred but\nSomewhere between one fifty and two hundred you can do it and about five years not counting getting raises not counting saving even more that's\nThe most I Would want to go okay I don't want to wait much more than five years or to buy and I don't want to wait much more than five years\nOut of your retirement system so I mean whatever you're going to do I would try to do it in under that ah but then so the point is you're sitting with a paid for property no payment in the world at that point right and you're making really good money and you're thirty something thirty one thirty two years old\nRight and so can you can you become a multi millionaire doing that absolutely you can\nOkay so now we're just pay yourself a house payment from age thirty page sixty you'd be a multi millionaire\nRight okay okay great so we'll we'll\nGo ahead and get when you're that maybe if we did you think it'd be it might be a good idea to do maybe I tend to retirement and say maybe a little bit less\nIt's up to you if you're gonna go longer than five years I'm starting to get pretty nervous about it okay okay if you're going to be under five years and you want to do zero in your case you're still going to be very young and without a house payment when you pay cash for this house\nRight thirty one years old is very young with zero house payment and you got the income for the rest of your life to build wealth with I mean if you will just keep paying attention again by yourself or house payment plus or minus a little you can be a multi millionaire\nOkay great thank you so much they create your vice\nVery well done good job you're thinking Deborah's whether it's in Tampa, Florida Hi Deborah how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nWell I'm I Am working on that you know a a financial peace university and I have paid off forty thousand dollars and twelve month good for you\nAnd yes and I'm Down to just one dead which is a hospital bill that we've been paying for many years now mhm ah with very small payments mhm and uh it's been ... collections and we've been looking at our credit report is making sure that all these debts have fallen off\nAnd um\nIt it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report and because of that my husband in a morning with the idea of just not adding that to the debt no ball and just continuing the minimum payments or\nEven not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you're actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a Brad ...\nNot just a mark but a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted this is a bad bill it's not a current bill 'cause they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered your payments because you couldn't pay them right and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than a thousand that point okay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a\nYou know a lump sum up three or four thousand an offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing okay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bail move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA lot of thank you for taking my phone call sure what I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for not actually out there anyway [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option is [noise] I went out to a lady out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit mhm [noise] and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nI'm going to the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd ready monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [noise] I neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care on policy and or\nOr another option but to take a tenure certain like what should be lower premiums and on your own life and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um and ah\nSo ah [laughter] the anytime you start weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages notice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call that his bundling\nAnd there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that smelled a rat and you have a good you have a good nose on your kid out [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving new to less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value we're down in value either one no no insurance ... backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk\nWhy because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility as I was with your home at Seventy years old or\nSomething like a growth in income Fonda balance fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money if I'm us Seventy 'em and they wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smarter faster as Dave Ramsey dot com put in your in following drop down a

of buying a vacation home with cash and renting it out when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with it at all with\nCash and your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else is paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start building somewhere else but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rent it out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to\nYou pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a hot season where the ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know run or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever and I know that\nThe pause it and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed and you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not but he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broken English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\nAnd we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second homeless or vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that and that's the price you pay the rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've gotta a lake house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a higher income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to be on a condo over knocks when when the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine", "show_name": "Focus on the Family", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar
