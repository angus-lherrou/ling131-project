{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was a pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh by just because he you know he surpassed the average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine\nBack then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in the seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching this stuff and you know after we are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my plan is the\nIdea that pont originally made their money to the ... trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out lighting houses with kerosene that fly that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct than that cannot days ran up and down these guys\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\nWell I Know that I I yeah I Do actually\nAnd the tour guide at the Roosevelt mentioned mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar in South America so that's where allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it\nThat's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you handle money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be that as well yeah I haven't heard\nThat about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book\nLet me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky\nBy the time you research and dig in\nBecause if you look at your name 'til you want to be a special can you know of course as far as I did\nI I still get

Tony Saturday near ... Georgia\nWho have had a pretty good go of it they really haven't experienced dips per se and they might have been married quite a while we get mail like that especially when we talk about difficulties I say we just haven't experienced that that probably is like the eighty twenty ... you might have a\nTwenty percent of couples who are sailing along pretty well um\nBut it's the eighty percent we want to talk about\nRace and and my guess is that those couples winning pretty well prepared\nRight they knew it was coming like that's why it was great to\nHave wonderful training you know bill and I went to seminary and Bible college and a part of that was learning about the seasons every couple of life and you know you jumped into God's word any ... at the time and the season for everything so God's word prepares you for CNN\nAnd so when you have mentors and when you have some good training like listening to focus on the family then you're not surprised\nAnd so some of the natural transitions I don't have to become storms or obstacles because you know what you're dealing with and you know what to do 'cause you have ... box\nWhich are helpful or you talk about a woman's midlife re evaluation somewhere around twenty eight to thirty eight I was a bit shocked by that because in today's culture a lot of twenty eight to thirty eight some things aren't even married yet\nRe right that it has to keep adjusting um but the stage of life will happen no matter what age you are and\nThis stage will happen and how I hit is if this is one that we don't talk about a lot\nAnd it typically heads and after you've been married for a few years some people ... like the seven year itch um fill it hits it after a few years and usually you're you're kind of in a mommy mode see kind of have the new motherhood thing down all back\nAnd maybe losing launched one of those kids into kindergarten or sell see let me just enough time to think huh\nWhy am I on the face at this club is it just and\nLaundry is that why I'm here you know or how do I balance it all career family ... age I feel like I'm just spinning plates like what is the meaning of life that is the big question\nBut it happens where it was shocking ... happens earlier for a woman than it does a man and a man is the forty forty five fifty midlife crisis and for us it's easy it's the gold medallion\n[laughter] I've never once did you ever where one of that yet yeah probably not ... but I'm\nIn pain will have it confirmed this but it it seems to me that it did the woman said kicks off his one for one of two reasons either I Know I'm done having kids so now what's next in my life or I put off having kids and how I get adjust to that\nIt might get a hurry up and have children or am I just can't let it go and be ...\nTimes it is connected to our biology\nWhen speak to the woman who is choosing career right now I'm you know her and her husband and made that decision here gene and gene did biochemistry she loved learning and she was teaching labs at a local university and really enjoyed that\nAnd that was in her mid thirties and then you know it was like wow we've got to have children the biological clock is going\nIn and boom you know thankfully the lord blessed us with two boys rather quickly\nAnd uh but a lot of women are struggling with that that's a phenomenon that is today um it's not just should I be at home it's work it's home it's balancing all of it does that put pressure on for that midlife reevaluate\nWhat it does put pressure on is what a woman is really asking she ... you know you might have this myth transition going on if you like walk into the living in like a cup at a place and you say I\nAm I on the Nazis or ... you know you go and take the ... to the kitchen you need loudly put away the dishes and some ... would you like some help [laughter]\nI don't want to put anybody out or anything yeah you gotta like overstated emotions and that's a little bit of assigned that's overstated [laughter]\nI Know you're having a midlife [laughter]\nYeah you find yourself being more emotional menu normally whatever your norm is you find yourself being a little bit more edgy and the reason why you have this question your heart and that is why am I on the face of this club and what am I supposed to do here now next that will make the best impact\nIt's important because this is the number one time in a woman's life when she's statistically most vulnerable to an affair and remember like what and fair like how am I supposed to work another sport person into my life in our busy enough\nBut women don't mean to the reason they don't mean to spend much time with a co worker you know easy Mrs sounding like I don't mean to spend my time with their boss late hour than just ... they don't mean to get a you know face but in ... you know the Internet's one to number one ways now\nI'm for people to reconnect 'em and blow their life apart in a second\nAnd then I don't mean to 'em but the dissent guarding their heart and the reason why they're so longing for this connection with their spouse and is that they had that question you know what is my value right now why am I here\nAnd what's my unique contribution that's what's on the heartbeat of that one man in that in midlife evaluation time wise woman instead drifting off and making emotional connection that will undermine her whole life wise woman grabbed her busy has been by the house and say I love us too much to just apart\nHey let's set some date nights I Need you for sounding board she'll grab a mentor and she'll say have you ever felt this way at mental can help blockers three and finding her unique ...\nShould get some girlfriends around like let's do Bible study together and figure out what's going on in the season of life and ... that we all mean\nAnd the big challenge during this time is that most people on earth their desires are bigger than their abilities so you mentioned your wife she was effective in her career but then she also wants to have a family\nAnd so she has these desires that all take up time and all take up focusing all require energy and it it comes down to I just don't have enough hours in the day of energy and my soul to do everything that's on my heart to do\nWell upset yeah and I said for women particularly the that the need to be two people yeah it is a stressful thing it's impossible to cheat but the demand for being to people or three people is always there let me ask you to respond to a listener\nWho wrote into focus and I think as a very specific question that puts this into context\nOr she wrote to us and said I feel like I made a mistake by marrying the man I did were not the same people we were when we got married we want different things have different morals and values and disagree on how to raise our kids\nAre we ever do any more fight am I supposed to continue in this miserable relationship\nUm what would you say to her what is her hope\nBut first of all I Would say to her\nEvery relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship ... and when things get out of kilter things get us out of sync\nPeople start to think oh it's a tragedy it's never going to turn we disagree on everything and it starts this downward spiral that begin starts to feed on itself ... and so now everything is evidence that this is a bad relationship\nAnd in reality all it takes in marriages one decision can turn everything because obviously this couple used to be in sync and they they loved each other and they had the agreements that they were moving forward on and now probably my guess is the stress of life has pushed them to a different\nPlace this focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment [noise]\nSix

we all can learn to when we hear about those experiences or it just goes to show not every\nMarriage is perfect I don't think there is a perfect marriage or you may have a really good marriage\nBut I don't know that it's perfect if it is called us let us know perfect marriage or many couples indeed I think all couples need a boost from time to time\nTo allow them to get back on a healthier path and that's why I focused on the family is here it's why we do what we do a for instance we recently received a comment from a listener to show how your investment is taking root and the hearts of people\nAre this woman is from Virginia here's what she said about one year ago I heard your guest speak about harmful nature of sexual relationships outside of marriage\nI was actually having an
