Gary you're holding your club ... I'm listening I mean that knows what he's talking about and so to be an agent of influence has to be someone who is receiving from God on a daily basis because you won't take the risk\nIf your happiness your sense of security your sense of wellbeing depends on what your husband thinks about you at any given moment your husband's a fallen man\nAnd he might be angry with you when you shouldn't be angry with you you might be impatient with you when you didn't do anything wrong and so I I Would say his desire is for the the woman to become God centered first so that she could really be an agent of his love torture has when they get it sounds\nStraight forward this is the right thing to do this is what we talked about in terms of the Christian to be rooted in Christ and have a foundation of him for our identity you've said that very clearly but it's really tough to put into practical oh you know everyday life\nAnd how do we prevent ourselves both husbands and wives for making marriage an idle particularly women I think emotionally they're expecting a lot out of this relationship at times more than husbands can deliver I'm not letting husband's off the hook\nAnd I'm just saying this is reality yeah\nIt it's a great point Jim and here's how I've avoided the idol well ... how it pushed back against the making marriage an idol I Try to love my wife out of worship to her heavenly father\nOne of my goals I fall so far short of this every day but it's a goal on aiming toward it is it I Want God said was angels I Wish other husbands would love their wives away my son Gary loves my daughter Lisa\nI Want to please God with how I treat lease and so the way I keep for making it an idle the way to keep from trying to turn ... into a love Gary like he wants to be loved machine is to please first my heavenly father got to you happy with how I handled my wife in that situation if she's having a bad day\nDid I give her grace sometimes you just gotta let somebody have a bad day it's a great work I mean ... or does she need encouragement because maybe she's being taken for granted by her kids are her friends\nMaybe I really see a way that God can use her and she's letting fear hold her back and she just needs loads of affirmation maybe she's going through a sickness and I want her to know it's not a burden to care for you it's my greatest joy\nI I'm here I Want you to focus on just getting well you've spent your whole life serving others let us serve you at this point but it really is at the end of the day lord are you happy with how I loved\nYour daughter and and I think that's the adage I don't know how it could ever be an idle because you're serving the one true God by loving your spouse ...\nGary in your book loving him well you have a a observation of Napoleon Bonaparte which when you think about it I think a lot of military academies probably lean on him for military strategy ingenious not so much for marriage advice um how did his relationship with his wife catcher notice\n[noise] well you know Jim having read through it the bowling Bonaparte can teach us what not to do as much as what he was a nurse assist of the highest order and he was vicious at times to his wife when she showed weakness he said I Need you to be strong the\n... and British needs to show her strength\nBut what we can learn from that is that the husbands need really is for the strongest wife possible\nThat that's the best way to bless your husband to become strong in the lord become strong in your character the only thing you can absolutely changing your marriage we talked earlier about influence the one person you can change is yourself and if you change yourself\nYou bring blessings into your marriage and you can learn you know what how do I learn to respond\nTo an impatient has been in a holy way how do I learn to dissipate my husband's anger you're not excusing his impatience you're not excusing as anger but you're learning how do I become stronger myself so that I can handle it would amaze me\nThat no one's ever been as wholly is Jesus\nAnd yet no one was ever let down or taken for granted or assaulted or attacked or maligned more than Jesus was\nAnd yet he never had this poor me attitude\nHe never said to his disciples it what are you going to do for me you know I'm I I Would you want to do is I I I and it's just amazing how because he was so centered in who got is that um he was trying to do so again the platform for influence is strength\nAnd that's what I think husbands look at I don't\nKnow I hate to talk in stereotypes because every marriage is its own story but since I get together with guys a lot they love to brag about their wives\nThey look they look up to that and and it might be different things you might be a great athlete you might be great with money she might be a great ... lawyer\nShe might newer Bible backwards and forwards you just might be so social you know and if the husband particularly is a big ... that that can be a big thing but ultimately I I think that's what you're looking at\nAs you seek to influence your husband say\nWhat am I bring into the equation here because it's never you don't want to get to the point of our marriage will be better when you get your act together it's always got to be the both than all improve my marriage when I improve me\nBut let's highlight that because that's an easy way for a flush to take us when you get your act together then will be a better couple 'cause my act as already together what about for that woman and I'm I'm sensitive to this for the woman who is trying hard she's the wife that has been doing some of these fundamentals that we've talked about in the first part of the program here\nBut there is that feeling like I'm the only one putting effort into this so to speak to that woman who says okay you're hear what you're saying you know I got to be the best me I can be in Christ\nBut man I've been doing that and it's still in their excuse the grammar\n... let me make a distinction here gym because I think it's important I Do believe as painful as it is for me to say this\nThat they're rather than trying to save some marriages or some marriages that women need to be safe from in the case of real abuse or dangerous situations of I don't want a woman to hear this and say okay I just need to to focus on myself so\nLet ... good ice diction I interviewed a number of women one of them was a woman that I think is similar type of woman you're describing\nHer husband was so uninvolved at home it was so frustrated he was always fishing and then she kept talking I says well fishing season is almost over\nForgetting to tell her that hunting season comes right after fishing season and then he was so involved in war and she was so disappointed she said I I'm ashamed to admit this but I found myself praying lord I Hope you'll have an affair or die so there's a biblical way out she saw her way for her marriage\nTo be improved you're saying and she was just miserable but as a committed believers she felt like well I don't have a reason to leave he's not abusing me he hasn't been unfaithful\nAnd she prayed through it and this will seem severe to some so I just want to know is that as we go in she came up with what she called the magic question and it was a shock she went he came home and she said\nWhat do you want me to do for you that I'm not doing ... she hated asking that question she pushed back with the lord saying he should be asking me that question there are a dozen things he should be doing that he's not\nAnd his answer mate or even angrier he said I Want you to be in a better mood when you get home\nAnd she asked me to do more laundry asked me to paint the house asked me to replace the route don't ask me to be in a better mood if you had in my life you wouldn't be in a better mood either but she realized you know what I make him pay for my frustration every time he comes home I let them know how unhappy I Am how frustrated I Am with everybody\nAnd so she said okay I just got put this in my mind I'm just going to try to do it and she did it\nAnd then she asked them again and and he gave her something else that had to do with the kids and at first again she was you're the absent father and you're telling me how to be a better mother\nBut what he said was true and it renewed her relationship with one of her daughters in particular she had a blind spot and that's just what we always have to remember just because their spouse is wrong doesn't make us right you can be wrong in a hundred different direction you can miss a target north south east or west\nBut that doesn't mean because somebody sitting at north you're not missing itself\nAnd then what happened\nWhen she began to make those changes her husband came along and he began to change as well I actually just heard from her last week they're celebrating their forty fourth wedding anniversary\n[noise] she said it's never been better and so it's going back to this year the easiest person to change\nThis focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a

I Believe the difference is that when you think about changing your husband you're only going to be happy based on something he does influence focuses on what you do partnering with God to be a positive influence\nTo be a nurturing influence and by example calling your husband to become the man that God created them to be as a husband as a father as the sun is a friend as a worker and got to can in fact\nYou're there's so much great content in your book loving them well I I didn't get to this last time and I want it to its quote I hate quoting back to the author of bug but let me do it on page thirty six you said this what if your husband's faults are God's tools to shape you\nWhat if the very thing that most bugs you about your spouse constitutes God's Plan to teach you something new\nOh seriously that is so stinking convicting [laughter] I mean you had to come up with that huh\nWell and it goes beyond marriage to how God can give you the perfect kid that knows exactly what button to push and in law or somebody at work and and the main thing is learning again I Can't change those around me\nBut I can be changed by interacting with those around me now I Do think they're destructive relations I Need to walk away from but often the ones that most frustrate me point out one of my own weaknesses because\nI'm contributing to the problem and I I Want to be stronger I Want to be wiser I Want to be a redemptive influence but I look at relationships sort of like practicing none of us have arrived none of us are completely mature none of us are completely Christ like\nAnd so when we interacting with the typical person's something their spouse saying OK\nI give myself a B minus there but here's what I did I think next time I can get a B plus and so you're just looking at that God is growing you as you learn to deal with your spouse and those\nAre such a great a lens to view it through it it takes you out of bitterness which is not healthy and it puts you in a different position is okay what is the Lord's teaching in this tough moment\nIn fact ... again you mentioned a scripture that you know we breeze through and you have captured it to say no focus the light on this uh James three to where it says we all stumble in many ways and you mentioned book have that kind of revolutionized how you thought about this\nWhy how did it revolutionize you're thinking\nI have probably talked about that verse forty hours in my lifetime if I were to add up all the marriage seminars and the\nBooks I put that in it it's been in every marriage book and in blockbuster and what not\nAnd it's still I forget\nEveryone was stumble in many ways it says all of us stumble in many ways there is no exception nobody gets to marry the fourth member of the trinity that person doesn't exist and we know that intellectually but sometimes in our hearts we resent it\nWas okay lord I Know my spouse has to stumble why does he have to stumble in that way or why can't she stumbled in this way and so we think how much easier it would be\nAnd I just point out if you're married someone else they may not symbol and this way but they're going to find another way to stumble\nThe Bible says we'll stumble in many ways one thing the Bible is so clear about we have to get it there's only one hero in scripture\nAnd that's Jesus I mean every major character David he wouldn't qualify as an elder in any Baptist church that I Know when people read his history and history and Moses I mean every one of them\nPeter ... every one of them has these things that just make us cringe and God is bold enough to say\nHe's still a man after my own heart yeah and I would say the wives can you look at a man who stumbles as David stumbled and have God's hard to say man he blew it here he blew it there he stumbles here\nHe's still a man has my heart you know that's the tough thing but that's the supernatural grace of God we need to realize that we need to receive that grace the more that I Know how God gives me grace I can give grace to others if I haven't got it\nThat I live by grace that I make myself the euro God loves me because I don't do that got accepts me because I've learned not to do that then I asked the same of other people but when I accept that Jesus is the only here on the Bible Jesus only hero today\nI've received grace I'm just so much more likely to give grace and Jim I Know people it was what people expect to pass or to say but for me I Can't love my wife and others well if I'm not spending time at the beginning of the day receive an affirmation from God when\nThat really does a point test toward the disciplines that allow us to do that in one of the things you encourage women to do is to form their heart towards their husbands through prayer\nThat can be hard to do when you're feeling this emotional separation when you're feeling\nAntagonistic toward your husband I mean really how do I prefer a guy and I really don't like I Know I got to love them but I don't like him right now so speak through that how that is so fundamentally important that you have a time of prayer for your husband just you\nDoesn't have to be with your husband um probably better if he's not there but they speak to that discipline and what has gained through prayer for your husband\nFirst let me talk about the danger of prayer\nIf you go into prayer with a list of your husband's weaknesses and spend twenty minutes or ringing God about how this has to change and he's making you miserably you're going to come out of that prayer sick in your heart
