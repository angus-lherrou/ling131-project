that was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just pay them off with the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch flip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right um other one's going out and we decided to bang for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we won and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was in we are just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future ... so we just we won ... intensity and your term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church and start racing center and so we uh\nGot that started right about the time we started we got everything in line to start\nA few in January at our church and we did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of things from what drew me to it because they believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Moore's caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out\nI mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened but it's not but on the show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nTheir show up for financial peace and they're not game on because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole peasant kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine\nMonths we did not do it\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell they got a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of the main\nThings that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell let's
