town home on the market and my sister who has my tenant by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place it's currently sitting empty the entire complex that it and that was gone down in value from my unit is we're Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm so therefore the unit of the same style and land is mine and I know the lowest\nPrice as like a thousand dollars good uh yesterday\nKen Lay and it came on the market I haven't had one Ninety Ninety I asked him [noise]\nI didn't get the ... how they have it hitting nprmontagne kind of you know I was thinking I've kept my price you pay right Ninety for an adult and ... got out of their pay six months way of kind of got\nOut there for a long time it pay five to seven out of pocket on the market is [noise] like I saw and how\nWould you how much we shoot out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nObviously you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland on it I don't know\nWhat I'm going to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping overall and you know that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five of them on the market [noise] I've got to be the lowest one on the market\nUm this is not looking good you know so I'm a without dropping another fifty thousand no I wouldn't [noise] you know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's\nThat's so ah but the but five thousand out of pocket to be done with those two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah that'd be done with that in a heartbeat I Do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case county and when I have not a place to move in and take time out really\nWell but I mean not only does this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worse three hundred thousand two years from now exactly\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's it's time to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMy put a tenant and wait on
