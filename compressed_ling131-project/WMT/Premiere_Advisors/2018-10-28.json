dad and gotten that far you know it's the only time yeah that's good\nAll right we've got plenty of time to do that let's see if we got time to do this we'll talk to another wonderful listener here on the Iowa excuse me not to I went on a garden journal snuff the ice you extension and outreach master garden there you go a good morning you're on with the master gardeners what's your first name where are you calling from\nAh my name in her and I'm from Kay what do we look for you\nWell raspberries I planted some live here and I don't\nKnow if I Need to trim 'em down or what I Do with them\nHow do you know world do you know which variety you planted\nWell one red and one for blacks oh man okay I've never\nReally not sure and the red one very pretty nice sized very than they had berry you know pretty much hurt yourself\nOK ... you get a crop in June or July and one later on to\nKnow about your age so you had to cry and cry or to crop variety yeah okay so you're on the red anyway\nOkay well what people yeah the black ones don't they are two craps so well with a with either one you want to cut down the branches that have little little caps on it where you had berries are cut those all the way to the ground because they're not going to marry again\nAnd it's going to be all the little ones that are coming up from the base that are going to give you your berries next spring and fall\nHere I I I did I did notice that that here but dry summer with anything\nYou can put some ... some good clean straw or some grass clippings are ... if you'd like to but he really is they're very hardy you don't need to do any of that if you don't want to just say just cut down the ones that had cats on them because they won't they won't bare again\nOkay you're there for a lesser I very much\nYou're welcome thanks for calling All right well they tell you what I Know I had raspberries at my old house I kinda wish I would've brought with better to\nGet a new variety yeah because a lot of the older varieties have diseases though that you don't want to move from one house to another I just wish I had my new plants in the spring is a good idea\nOkay well I still have to decide if whether or not I'm going to do [noise]\nA gardener or whatever I guess I Need to go to will ... little race garden raise Garry Harrison thing here raised ... yeah [noise]\nWell uh we ... that there thank you so much everyone for listening to the show again today are the highest shoe extensive outreach master gardener program for my issue extension Linn county\nBut what's really important you know the short term things in relation to like race prep or retirement prep as debt management okay good point if if you don't want to just come in and you'll have a full retirement so she just wanted to kind of pieces of the show and apply it to your daily life first and foremost where's your debt\nThat can be a real killer is what people don't realize is like for a marathon runner it's almost like drinking salt water\nYou know you'd say well why would you drink salt water will eventually the salt is going to dry out it as a reverse effect of\nNot really hydrated and he was going to dehydration over time and that's what that does is it the hydrate your portfolio over time because the interest rate that you have on debt is a permanent loss you know you can put money in the market and it may go up and may go down at me stay the same\nBut that is going to have an interest rate that is permanently losing money sure you have\nA certain kinds of debt like whole mortgage you know or a better form of debt because hopefully you're also building equity in your home your kind of putting money away towards that dry but other debt credit card student loans or things that really kill people and\nYou know you need to make sure that when you're doing these planning you're not making haphazard choices with investments and ignoring the debt side of it what do you think Jason\nYeah I agree with Tony another kind of analogy use are kind of a taking a look at what a marathon is versus retirement planning as you also want to get that feel the course that you're running same thing with retirement playing you know there's a lotta hills and the marathon or downhill or a lotta turns\nYou want to make sure that you're planning for that when it comes to your preparation it's the same thing with your retirement planning\nAnd that's why we run the retirement analysis for our clients and for him by the walk through our door\nBecause basically what we want to do is get a good picture of what that course it's going to look like for you through retirement\nFind out where the hills are where the valleys are where the corners are so that we can set up your expectations and investments to make sure that you're getting the highest chance of achieving your goals finishing the race\nIt's twofold like Jason said the retirement analysis you know comes in different levels it's not just a one size fits all\nBut it's there to help you know prospective clients and current clients but it's also there to help us it makes us better planners when we have a better picture of what you're going through and that's why if you are looking at the planning and preparation side of things\nYou know let us know in our office will send out to you it's not just a hey come in and we'll sit down and who knows what's gonna happen will send you a package of preparation materials some questions in there and also include a checklist of items to bring in and so if you're in the planning and preparation phase you just don't know where to start\nJust call in and ask for one of our preparation packets and will be more than happy to get that sent out to you\nKnow that some great points that you guys make especially even helping your own selves get through that you know planning and perhaps obviously a huge key to just about anything in life and of course we're just kind of using it from an athletic standpoint here today\nBut I think Tony brings up a great point so let me go ahead and just do this if you'd like to go ahead and get started and you do need some planning and ... and as Tony mentioned they've got some resources to help you with that reach out to them a day for for for two for playing and told me if they want to come in and do that what's that whole process going to look like\nSure it's gonna be reaching out and leaving us a message for us to contact you so leave us a phone number or you could even leave us an address if you want us to send the material to earn the email\nAnd we'll reach out to you to send you that preparatory information that packet of questions and kind of a checklist of items and you bring that in in the first meeting Israeli women considered almost like a first date you know\nMade us we're getting to meet you [laughter] you know we want to make sure that we're right fit for you and your right fit for us so it's a lot of questions and answers there isn't really a wrong answer you can give us\nA your answer might be I don't know I don't care you know these are\nAll sound like my date [laughter]\nAnd these are legitimate things because when we are putting together our recommendations we have a fiduciary duty to put our clients best interests first or a perspective points best interests first so we need to know a little bit more vouchers and just the numbers\nYou know it's more than just investments and so in that point in preparation that first meeting is getting to know a little bit better getting a new U.S us taking down some information and then it takes us I don't know roughly a week sometimes a little less sometimes a little more depending on the complexity of the case and we put together an analysis of written review of what the\nRest of your life is looking like based upon what we know today and then they give us some recommendations maybe to leave things alone or it may be to tweak a couple of things where we think it would be an advantage by making some changes\nWell if you'd like to get started a day with this process it's pretty easy to do folks were got much more to come today on the program before we take a break let me remind your job this number down pen pencil crayon\nOn line or whatever it is that you have the right with ketchup packing I don't care but right down eight four four four to four plan get yourself on the counter no cost relegated to get started telling you just laid out a really simple process and how\nEasy it is to kind of go through these pieces\nTo get started with your own planning and preparation for your own retirement marathon if you will aid for for for two for planned to talk of the teen premier advisors today a four four forty or plants much more to come on the program we're going to continue on with our analogy for going to get to Jason here and just a second I Know a tiny dominated that one but we'll be right back with\nOn the conversation here on the other side don't go anywhere [noise]\nGetting the right retirement plan is important to make sure that the person designing your planted by by the three sees your plans should be comprehensive and then it leaves no stone unturned\nEvery angle of the retirement world should be considered from estate planning to tax planning and risk versus safety all of it is important to consider your plans should also be customized cookie cutter plans are no no\nYour plans should be unique to your situation and any true financial analysis will reflect that finally ended visor she put that plan together for you complimentary at no cost or obligation to you\nIt should be a fact finding mission not a sales pitch out of the gate so remember the three sees comprehensive customized and complimentary\nIf you're struggling to find that kind of plant called the team at premier advisors aid for for for two for plan that's eight for for for two four seven five to six called today for that three sees analysis eight four four four to four plan\nAnd are from we have the client and only the lions in mind [noise] our mission is to get to know and understand your needs blondes and long term goals we want to help you develop implement in monitor a strategy that's designed to address your individual situation\nSo keep listening to the new retirement ... to find out more\nHere with us on new retirement reality it's more than just investments with Tony gave certified financial\nPlanner and Jason ... financial advisor both of those fellows can be found at for me are advisers along with Todd and Marty who have had the last couple of weeks off we're going to have to get those guys [laughter]\nThat's very sewer but anyway they're having a good time for for forty four plan your number to call if you are in the listening area and you can hear our voice and you'd like to get some help but get yourself on account of the team will certainly give you a hand in any way they can do travel out to see if need be so give him a jingle eight four four four to four plan\nFellows we were talking about marathon prep training things of that nature how you know retirement is more like a marathon than a sprint so let's go back to our analogy and kind of have some more fun with is really good at conversation a good information to first go around a proper diet which would write their kill me forever being a marathon runner\nBut a proper diet is really important for those people who do run and Jason you know use the sprint and I think he played baseball as well right\nYeah yeah that is a long long time ago [laughter]\nBut still the idea is you know what you gotta do to get ready for an athletic event and so let's see if we can do also correlations to proper diet when it comes to the financial side sure well it's just like when you're ...\nPlanning for the race and you're setting out the course and taking a look at everything that\nIs going to go into that marathon the one thing that you want to do is he on also prepare your body for doing that and you do the same thing with your portfolio when it comes to your retirement planning\nYou know in those years before you are planning on retiring you want to make sure that you're taking a look at what your risk tolerance truly is for your investments in may be shaving off some additional risk terms of fat right exactly germs and that from the portfolio before you get to retirement because again\nLike maybe eating a big pizza and before you go on a maritime probably wouldn't be wise well they well they do carbo load but I don't know if it's a pizza right [laughter]\nBut something that's going to you know fill you up to the point where you feel heavy and weighted down while the same thing can be kind of said with your portfolio\nYou don't want to take a lot of risk rights when you're going to stop the accumulation phase of your life which is retirement and into the distribution phase of your life where you start maybe pulling money out of those accounts to supplement your income because if we have a big downturn in the market and you're heavily invested in the market at that time\nYou could potentially be looking at you know to put it in with this analogy maybe starting the marathon a couple of miles behind everybody else\nSo you want to make sure that before you get to retirement you're taking a look at how diversified you are what types of assets you have indefinitely what types of risks are associated with their investments\nYeah I couldn't agree with Marjorie some you know just like the marathon runners going to have a\nBalanced meal you know maybe a certain amount of carbs wean foods the things that you know fuel your body same thing with a proper diet with your portfolio checking your equities you know your stocks versus bombs knowing the risks with changes to interest rates how that's going to impact\nYou also want to make sure you have an emergency fund you know you've got a reserve in place just like runners might deeper Joe pack of electrolytes fluid or something like that give them a boost if they're running a little low\nGreat offer from the team here from premier advisors on the show eight four four four to four plan to take advantage of it\nEight four four four to four plan called that number leave your name and phone number they'll get back with you there team will call you back and schedule a time it's convenient for you\nAnd of course you don't have to worry about scheduling that they'll take care of that when they call back all we need you to do right now is simply call in and say yeah I like what I heard on the show this week I really want to talk to somebody about my own retirement journey aid for for for two for plan if it is golf like Jason mentioned like me or you want to see how many balls you can put in\nThe water and just to keep the manufacturers in business that's what I Do [laughter] it's it's certainly something you can

advisors Jason will and board and Tony gave on the program here with me today having a great conversation as we always do on the radio talking about the world of investing finance and retirement and if you got questions they hopefully have some answers and they can try to provide those answers as\nBad as we do you do have well I didn't want to pigeon hole you just sitting there you know if somebody came in with something crazy you know if we don't have it\nWe will research it and we will find\nThere you go to put me in my place a four four four to four plan to get some of those answers from the guy's a four four\nFour to four plan and get yourself on the counter come and have a conversation obviously good guys to talk to as well so gentlemen let's talk about major life events to round out the program for this week we're all going to encounter these there's some significant changes that we all hit\nIn our life's journey and of course and fortunately it's no different when we're heading in towards retirement and maybe it's in the pre retirement stage maybe it is even in retirement but these\nThings can happen so let's talk about a few of these and some ideas to look out for Tony let's kick it off with the job changed significant life event that can be especially if it's a major career change\nOh absolutely and you know the first thing to distinguish there is whether it's when you say job change it kinda brings to mind is it a forced job change or a voluntary job change you know what I make some pretty big difference from a financial standpoint a force job change could have come out of the blue if you were laid off or something like that\nWhile a voluntary one hopefully you've been taking steps to prepare yourself\nThat's really where an emergency fund comes into play\nYou know why it's really important in the financial planning process to have an emergency fund just in case it is not a voluntary job change it to force job change that way you get some pushing to get you through it a little less stressful and allows you to focus on you know is is the point of retirement or is this the point that you need to get another job\nNext you really want to consider any four one K. or pension that you have make sure you explore the options make sure you're not being forced out of the plan\nOr any fees are changed or you know there is on the issues there and then you start planning on well what's this job change going to look like is there any income changes do you need to adjust your spending do closed you need new transportation is your commute change and you have to move\nYou know all these things can be some of the financial aspects that come along with the job change so\nIf you're thinking one might be in the near future either forced or voluntary you know start putting together a checklist of those things you know yeah tournament playing income spending those are the three things that you really start focusing on\nYeah definitely some good points there to think about it for a job changes on the horizon what about a divorce case and now you know more and more of it is what it is in our society right the rate is but I don't know fifty percent or something like that but it does happen as well for pre retirees and retirees sometimes yeah unfortunately\nIt does occur much more frequently than it did in the past and when a divorce happened taking really upheaval whole retirement plan just in general you're finding\nAnd says are all topsy turvy during that time and especially when it comes to your retirement planning all of a sudden\nSome things that you may be having for expectations have completely changed and one thing that you have to do look at is if you have a four one K. potentially there'd be acquired you're on that where your spouse gets half of yours you get half of your spouse's same thing with a pension any IRAs for that regard as well\nSo you're basically looking at really completely changing what you had for expectations financially moving forward\nAnd the other thing that you want to think about when something like this occurs is beneficiary information on a lot of your accounts\nYou know I don't know depending on how the divorce goes I'm assuming that you don't want to have your life savings go to your ex spouse after a divorce or ... [laughter] yeah I'd say about a hundred percent of the time that I actually come into encounter with that it's not been that way but\nThe way to take a look at your beneficiaries because that's one easy thing to kind of mess because so much focus is on how the assets gets split up and what goes into that you're going through proceedings for the divorce that\nThat one little thing about who do you want this money to go to in case of your death\nCan sometimes get nasty and you want to make sure that you're setting that up accordingly when something like a divorce happened so that you're taking care of any children that are potentially from the marriage and making sure that you get the assets that you get to keep\nGoing to the people that you want it to go to so again basically it's a really tough time it's really great to sit down with an advisor during this time to look at your different options that you have available what kind of laws are in place you might have to speak to an attorney of course\nFor that but we can help get that beneficiary information change for you and help kinda guide you financially through your investments during that time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Premiere Advisors", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "28"}
