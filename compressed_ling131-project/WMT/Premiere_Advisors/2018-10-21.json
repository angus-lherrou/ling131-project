{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "You know the one percenters out there and I'm not saying that everybody has to be that but that's how that really wealthy stay wealthy and keep their families wealthy is they do it in a tax efficient manner so they're they're very in tune with what's going on with taxes and you know in a completely legal way of course\nBut or him make make their money as as tax efficient as possible and the second thing I see from legacy standpoint is making sure people have updated their beneficiary information so that if they do pass on\nYou know there there isn't a issue where the money's going to somebody they did not intend to or somebody's passed away and therefore it falls down into a maybe a contingent beneficiary they didn't didn't necessarily want in place\nI think some of the things to mark as far as a mistake every now and then as they just don't review it enough\nWe maintain everybody around here sit down once a year in review their state plan\nAt a minimum so we know that it's on pace and doing exactly what they want it to be there are a lot of changes in a person's life and families all the time so\nThere are some adjustments that have to be made to that to make sure that we're maximizing everything Tony talked about passing a legacy on I mean when you think about it I mean everybody has got some kind of legacy or state plan\nWhere does it really depends on how much money it's just that you do different things if you have more money with it or you really only have four buckets with all your money I mean the first bucket would be you and if you're married you and your spouse\nIf you want and you say Mardi uh we're just going to spend everything we worked hard for their kids are doing good well then you're probably not going to have much I'm an estate planning need but if there's any kind of money you'd like to leave on to somebody else then there's really only three bucks for that\nThat's your heirs charity and the IRS and mark or I'll let our listeners out there ... two of them right back if you look at it you know you have heirs charity and the IRS well nobody really wants to give it to the IRS so\nWe dig deep to see how much you want to leave your heirs are if you have any charitable inclinations to leave it to charity I mean the United states is one of the most charitable countries in the world so we really promote that a lot to around here to help leave an ice legacy for charities not certainly a grand yeah\nMark a lot of people what they don't understand this kind of falls into the mistakes type of thing that you talked about as they don't really understand the difference between a designated direct beneficiary\nIf it goes by will or if it goes by trust and what the pros and cons of each of those different strategies are so we would put a lot of emphasis on education so that people know what their choices are and what the\nCost would be but also what the advantages and disadvantages are some aren't you know when we look at what a person's legacy is it it's really what they want to make of it they they go through a checklist of is it do they want to leave money is it that they want to leave a sense of purpose of what they've done you know we've had people leave\nLand farms cabins ... uh you know not just investments as part of their legacy some people do it through life insurance some people do it through other means\nBut you really want to go through that checklist of what you want your legacy to be what your goals are and we can help you to do that as long as you come in and sit down and talk with us we can go over those items with you and that's why we liked to extend the following offer\nWe'd like to give you the ability to take advantage of an

hundred thousand dollars in assets that we can help you to work with what the review is going to make sure that you have\nAll of your retirement planning bases covered so for instance Social Security which age should you start taking the benefits and it's very important 'cause they only give you one year after you start taking it to change your mind\nAnd how does it fit into your overall income picture how much risk are you taking in your portfolio and is inappropriate how much are you paying and fees and commissions with your current plan and what about the tax implications of your savings is there a way to save money\nIn taxes down the road by being proactive now in planning now so you know these are a lot of the things that we look at we also want to look at do you have an income plan in place to be sure you are in danger running out of money if you do end up\nLiving thirty or more years in retirement do you have a plan to address inflation what about long term care or legacy planning obviously there's a lot of things that we need to discuss and we don't have to tackle everything all at once we can address them in pieces\nWe just found that most people just haven't even begun thinking about all the pieces that we do in our everyday job this is what we do this and what we have a passion for and this is why we're in this business is to think of those details and to help people come up with solutions\nSylvia realizing that your current plan doesn't have all the answers to these questions this is your chance now to correct that and get truly a comprehensive plan

standard now we're going to switch over to this we spend a little time on legacy planting the guys first of all I think a lot of people have heard about the need to work within visor who's a fiduciary maybe some habit\nSo real fast let's what is it and why is it important\nWell I think the biggest thing mark as you're hearing more and more about the fiduciary standard out there the department of labor came out with something that talked about that about a year ago [noise] but anyway I think the definition is really when it comes to produce Sherrie is taking care of someone else's money in a suitable way\nSo and if you're doing that I mean there's a lot of key components and they're taking care of someone's money naturally but you have to do it in a suitable way and I think the biggest thing that we work on around here is that you have to cement\nThat relationship in on trust I mean that's a basis for all these relationships is that you have to trust someone if you came in and saw and all we want to do is find out where all your money is and then move it over here do this and that\nI don't know I'd be leery myself because you do you want to sit down and really feel comfortable with somebody\nThat you get some kind of a trust factor going on with them if that takes an interviewer too well then go ahead and do it but I'm more curious and I know Tony as to when we talk to folks is just I'm finding out exactly what they want to do and how we can help him\nA lot of times you might just be sitting there listening to folks for twenty thirty minutes or getting to know them a little better and they get to know us but that really helped I think a and Tony I think you'd agree to that that really helps to build that trust basis correct\nI don't know we should have passed a law to make a responsible that people put their clients needs ahead of their own so that's just me I think that's something that all people probably want to work with someone in that similar situation\nSo if you've got questions concerns you'd like to reach out to the team and have that conversation go ahead eight four four four to four plant a four four four to\nFour plan to talk with
