butterflies\nOkay no I mean what's really nice about these library talks or if you come out to see the master gardeners you do also get the opportunity McEwen air for each one of these drugs are\nDefinitely will and will answer more questions or grass questions or anything you know if it's not part of the ... right\nOr you don't have to stay on topic I mean you'll address the top but it's part of the presentation right or if you are from early and make a lot easier to answer those uh-huh you\nKnow and it's in their free ... um were and we all of these that are from six or seven thirty so you got time to get home from work maybe grab a neat and an income and dumped a male nurse come is really quite exciting to be able to do this because that's what we do is that we are we educate\nOur way we want to let people know what's going on and and educated\nWell it's good to have a free resource because uh gardening as a hobby for so many people but uh I Would imagine they feel like\nA little awkward about I'm asking a question or something like that not just a it's one of those things that people may be a little bit bashful for I Am going to take a call here but we're down to just a minute left so good morning you're on with one county master gardeners you have a minute to go right ahead\nGood morning I've got a twenty foot or excuse me twenty year old hearts\nOh absolutely the preparation is key and I guess to answer your question marks you to take the buyout or stay with the job I guess the most straight for the answer is well it depends on what to buy out is a true originally yeah how how good or bad it is\nYou know some considerations if you're in that spot is just as Todd said I don't need to reiterate everything he said you know but but a good plan and preparation is key because you got to consider things such as health insurance how old are you before baby you reach sixty five or Medicare can help you out with health insurance\nAnd also do you have any kind of emergency fund in place so if you don't take a buyout offer we have seen in the office where\nThey will rescind the buyout offer it's not that it stays out there forever it's kinda I take it or leave it\nAnd if you stick with your job your job may be eliminated in the future it may not you know there's a risk there so if you are going to not take a buyout offer and stay with your job just to make sure you kind of change your mind set in and change your mindset to say well if my job's eliminated tomorrow am I prepared for that and if you're not\nThen you should develop a little bit better plans for again health insurance emergency fund that type of thing but\nThat's certainly something that you could talk to us about a game we have experienced some people may be experiencing this for their first time you know ever getting a buyout offer or a severance offer we've dealt with it a lot so we've seen all the different ah iterations that can take in or we could probably offers some pretty helpful advice on that we're\nTalking with the guys here on the overtime that reality that's what you're listening to as a talking about just early retirement options and some questions that come up when these things arrive so let me ask you then let's play devil's advocate and say we've\nGone away from the taking the chances of the job we're going to accept the retirement buy out now the next question is should I accept the pension buyout and received that lump sum or do we do the pension as that monthly lifetime payout that becomes the next big point\nOh absolutely mark and that's something that you know in our office again we do a lot of modeling what ifs scenarios and that's one of the big ones is do I take a lump sum what does that look like in the future do I take the monthly pay out\nPart of it is also establishing what type of lifestyle you're able to do and to to give you an example some people want to have their bank account fill up each month and they can spend the entire bank account and knowing that next month and I'll feel back up again and they stick pretty good it's kind of a self discipline they're having a monthly payment\nOther people would rather have the lump sum and take some from when they need but they also have to have the discipline\nNot having run out early you know that it may not last year your entire life so\nWhen looking at these options it's best to model out pros and cons and some of it also depends on the size of the lump sum relative to the monthly pay out we've seen some lump sum of equal maybe only two or three years of monthly payments and in that case would be relatively healthy probably makes sense to do those monthly payments\nOther times I've seen it where the lump sum is equal to Fifteen Seventeen years a monthly payments and in that case you may be able to manage that money for a greater return or a greater security of income by taking that lump sum would you agree to\nHigh definitely agree I think when you're looking at either scenario there are advantages and disadvantages to both options\nThe biggest advantage for the lump sum buyout as as you now have full control of how the money's invested and you can spend the money at will so if you want to spend more than what the monthly check would be that option is yours\nUm if something were to happen to you and your spouse the funds are then going to pass down to your children where if you choose the monthly option and some have the to you in most pensions that pension dies with you and there's nothing left\nSo if you haven't had a chance to get all the money out of it uh the pension plan keeps it and that's what funds future options you know it's interesting Tony talked about you know how the decision can be a tough decision to make a I've been sitting down with couples talking about the lump sum option or the monthly\nAnd in some cases one may decide that you know I think I'd rather have the lump sum option and then the spouse looked at them and says I seen how you invest money and\nI'm not going [laughter] [laughter]\nSo they want to make sure that might be their jails or sometimes a monthly option\nIt does provide that peace of mind knowing that there is going to be a check just like Tony talked about every month or your bank account fills up with a chunk of money and you've got thirty days and then another check comes in some people that peace of mind and that's more important to them\nThan having the flexibility with the money so it's not really a decision and that's why we sit down and will run a plan for you looking at both options what does it look like if you take a lump sum option what does it look like if you take a monthly pension and then we'll clearly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each option\nAnd try and help make the decision that's best for you\nYeah absolutely Todd and you know a couple of other things are considered mark is some people will take a lump sum option if there at all in fear that the company may declare bankruptcy not necessarily go into business but to declare bankruptcy to offload pensions because\nPensions originally were created when people were only living sixty sixty five years of age on average and now people are living in eighty eighty five years on an average and so some of these pension companies say well you know what we're not going to be able to sustain this we need to offload this on a pension guarantee border find some way to get rid of it\nAnd the other thing to consider is if they give you different options you know they may give you a one time payment as an option or they may allow you to pay it out over several months and that may also turn into a tax decision it was closer to the end of the year maybe you want to spread out those payments\nAnd push taxes into two tax years but all of these things should be under a checklist of things that you want to go through you know lump sum versus monthly payment water the payment options are there survivor benefits\nAnd if you have that checklist together that's something that you could bring into as we can analyze for you whether it's just answering some questions are putting together an entire analysis of what your future retirement would look like just as Todd said those what if scenarios\nYou know were thrown a lot of information out at you over these phases or these years coming up to retirement so this is something that we would like to do we'd like to give you the ability to take advantage of an opportunity to get a complete financial review\nAnd offer it to you for free again in order to put together a plan there are some assets that we need to work with so we do ask if you have at least a hundred thousand dollars in assets that we can help you to work with but the review is going to make sure that you have\nAll of your retirement planning bases covered so for instance Social Security which said should you start taking the benefits and it's very important because they only give you one year after you start taking it to change your mind\nAnd how does it fit into your overall income picture how much risk are you taking in your portfolio and is it appropriate how much repaying and fees and commissions with your current plan\nAnd what about the tax implications or your savings is there a way to save money\nIn taxes down the road by being proactive now in planning now so you know these are a lot of the things that we look at we also want to look at do you have an income plan in place to be sure you are in danger of running out of money if you do end up\nLiving thirty or more years in retirement do you have a plan to address inflation what about long term care or legacy planning obviously there's a lot of things that we need to discuss and we don't have to tackle everything all at once we can address them in pieces\nWe just found that most people just haven't even begun thinking about\nBut all the pieces that we do in our everyday job this is what we do this and what we have a passion for and this is why we're in this business is to think of those details and to help people come up with solutions\nSo if you're realizing that your current plan doesn't have all the answers to these questions this is your chance now to correct that and get truly a comprehensive plan in place all you have to do is call us and we'll set time I saw it on the calendar to meet with you\nAnd that number is eight for for for to for a plan to take advantage of the offer\nFrom Tony here on the program come on and I have a

and that's one of the reasons that we feel it's important to sit down and have a plan you know if you are presented with a situation where you you might have a buyout offer\nBut it's really good to to have a plan in place to see is that going to fit into winter all objective is and I think one of the other hard decisions is is should I take it as a lump sum are so they take a monthly\nBy sitting

come into play here\nAnd then when we talk about do I need to get another job well there's a need to be a full time job or can't it'd be a part time maybe we're at a position where financially are

the counter aid for for for two for playing eight four four four to four plan\nOr they service all along the quarter as I say all the time Cedar Falls Iowa City Waterloo Cedar Rapids all points in between a lot of times they might even come out and see you Tony loves to drive as he's mentioned many times on this program if you are not new to the show so I gave them a jingle and get on the counter eight four four four to four plan\nAnd speaking of driving Tony ... so when you get out of that car ride around your we've all had experiences at one time or another but we've got all those little warning lights right we all that stuff on the dashboard little show if something's going on I used to have this jalopy back in the day that forever in a day would have a like come on for something it seems like a fix one thing and it'd be another\nYou know and so I was thinking about financial warning lights I was thinking about you really when we were talking about the show notes and that was like well Tony drives a lot let's see if we can do something with cars so that's where they came up with financial warning lights\nVery well I tried to maintain my current none of those lights come on\nI Do I Know we all do but it was a it's an allergy right is real with it but just thinking about it right you get different you know leaking oil low tire pressure whatever so it'd be kinda cool if we had some financial warning lights and I'll give you a few things for you guys to to expound on a little bit but\nLet's start with having no idea what it actually costs to fund your lifestyle I don't know if that would equate to like the check engine or not but that's a pretty big one having no clue what it's going to cost you\nOh that's the entire dashboard light\nOn where you are okay if you don't have a budget I mean most people might have a guess but it's usually way off okay to give an example uh as you're sitting here right now thinking about it\nI Want to pose your question and you need to tell me in five seconds ten seconds what your monthly expenditures are and you have to be within a hundred dollars\nOh wow yeah I imagine most people will be failing right about now\nSo think about that you know most people while you're working they don't have a budget they know roughly input max amount away if there's a little extra at the end of each month I might put it away or maybe it will take a trip or do something with it\nBut think of all the things that you may not have factored in a lot of people were going to factor in All right ballpark ah here's what my mortgage payment is\nBallpark a water gas electric maybe throw in a couple of hundred bucks or if you've got kids maybe a higher amount for food but have you thought about any healthcare costs cell phone Internet property taxes homeowner's insurance\nNewspaper costs I mean all the little things that add up\nYou really need to know what's in your budget for your lifestyle in any type of retirement plan I mean that's one of the key things we do when we sit down with somebody for the first time as we ask them to go through and come up with a budget doesn't have to be to the penny 'cause each month is going to vary but you do have to have a good sense of\nWhat you want to do in retirement because most people don't want to lower their lifestyle they want to keep it relatively close to what they're doing now at least in the first couple of years retirement and if you don't know what you're actually spending you can actually plan for what you're going to spend in the future also having an idea of what\nYou what your lifestyle looks like we do in our in our says we'll look at what all the influence or that that you have coming in\nWill look at the outflow is that you tell us about when we give you a a a checklist you know when when somebody makes us for the first time we send them a either in the mail or email a checklist of things you should consider put together budgeting items that type of stuff\nAnd what we look at is where is the linkage between the money coming in versus the money you're telling us is going out and in some cases we found tens of thousands of dollars of leakage you know each year where somebody says I Can't believe I've got thirty thousand dollars on accounted for in a given year well\nThat's what the numbers you told us are saying and then that causes them to go back in further refined their information so we can put together more solid plan yeah that's what I say lights up the whole dash it's yeah it's kind of the core your budget is the core of what makes things weren't while you're working or not working\nYeah absolutely so we're kind of talking here today about indicators dislike you think about on your car right you get indicators if something's going wrong with the vehicle while there are indicators in your financial life that may point out you have a problem that needs to be addressed and\nSo title me ask you may be focusing on that certain dollar amount we've covered this before everybody thinks of those commercials what's your number but some people do get overly obsessed with saying I've got to get to this network or this account balance", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Premiere Advisors", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "14"}
