its bruising partisan battle leading up to the Supreme Court confirmation Brett Kavanaugh who faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd uh you need to talk to somebody that works with it every day whether it be a Social Security officer or somebody like us that can sit there and look at all the different options that are available to you to make sure that it's fitting what you want it to do and I'm making sure that your maximizing your benefit at the most\nRecent he made some good points and you actually sparked a in my head something that ah neither of us covered that may be important to our listeners out there\nIs that you know starting your Social Security there may be as Jason mentioned some tax ramifications there's what's called a provisional income calculation\nThat if somebody doesn't know what that is it's something we can go through in our office or or you may be able to look it up online as well but also what people don't realize is that if you start Social Security and you're still working Social Security may reduce your benefit depending on how much money you make if you go over some ... threshold so that may play into the decision as well\nYeah and obviously you know Jason mentioned as well you know consider this for just you're not just yourself with yourself and your spouse sometimes I think we get so wrapped up and getting things going that we kind of forget to look at the the whole team picture if you will and of course as a couple\nYou know when you're hitting retirement you want to make sure you're having those conversations with your advisor about what's going to be best for both of you a short long term sometimes there's a strategy of\nOn the person who maybe makes less trying to hold off as long as they can things of that nature so always have a conversation with your financial advice and if you'd like a second opinion and that's one of the reasons we do the show to give you some things to think about the team can certainly help you out there\nAnother place guys for the decision that I really can't undo is electing the spousal benefits if you're lucky enough to have a pension whether you take it or not you've got to make sure that it's going to be the right choice before you get it done\nYeah you're absolutely right mark this is one of those irrevocably things and I'll give you an unfortunate event that occurred that I had to deal with and that is I had a client who previous before I met them actually had their pension on and and they're working and he passed away and\nThe wife was expecting that income to continue and it didn't and\nWe really had to make some adjustments and it was all because you know they thought the flashy biggest number for for the single life benefit and that's one thing that you got to look at when you do go into her time if you're fortunate enough to have a pension\nThat sometimes that you'll see that per se benefit and you'll see that larger amount of a monthly benefit and you won't even think twice about it\nAnd you have this she's that one when again you have to kind of considered the whole team and that would be your spouse as well especially if you're spouses younger and has maybe a better history of health and their family there's a lot of different factors that go into it again\nBut once you turn that on a it's permanent and so you want to make sure that again what you want to achieve it set up correctly the first time and again can't reiterate there's enough\nSit down with somebody that deals with this every day knows the different options that are available how it's going to affect your overall outcome and then choose the plan that's going to fit your needs\nYeah Mark I'm also like to point out you know every pensions a little bit different than the next in terms of the options they offer they may offer similar calculations but a lot of times they'll explain it or have a\nName listed for it's a little bit different when you look at a pension some will offer a lump sum option also uh outside of just electing a spouse will benefit\nMost pensions oh we'll have a single life calculation just on the the one employee and the other calculations that they'll have if there is a spouse will benefit will either be\nAnywhere between fifty to a hundred percent spouse will benefit usually in twenty five percent increments and Jason pointed out you want to look at your pension statement to find out what are the options and what are you really need for your family and what do you want to have covered in the event something happens you your your spouse's is taking care of so\nGoing through that checklist understanding what options are they're individuals have ... for example there are some spouse benefits there but they come with\nSome life insurance carriers on on some of the options you know and so there's a lot of different variables there sometimes I Will also offer a lump sum benefit and it may or may not be the best option for you to maximize what you can get out of the system\nSome people will need a lump sum of cash that they can manage other people will need for lack of better term a couple of gifts filled up each month and that they can spend that know that it'll get refills each month and that's what keeps them on budget but really going through the checklist of things that you need goals income wise when you're doing retirement planning\nPension options really factor in as well and if Jason mentioned you really should look into finding a professional that help you manage through all those choices and make the best one for you\nKnow were thrown a lot of information out at you over these phases or these years coming up to retirement so this is something that we would like to do we'd like to give you the ability to take advantage of an opportunity to get a complete financial review\nAnd offer it to you for free again in order to put together a plan there some assets that we need to work with shall we do ask if you have at least a hundred thousand dollars in assets that we can help you to work with what the review is going to make sure that you have\nAll of your retirement planning bases covered so for instance Social Security which said should you start taking the benefits and it's very important 'cause they only give you one year after you start taking it to change your mind\nAnd how does it fit into your overall income picture how much risk are you taking in your portfolio and is inappropriate how much are we paying and fees and commissions with your current plan\nAnd what about the tax implications of your savings is there a way to save money in taxes down the road by being proactive now in planning now so you know these are a lot of things that we look at we also want to look at do you have an income plan in place to be sure you are in danger running out of money if you do end up\nLiving thirty or more years in retirement do you have a plan to address inflation what about long term care or legacy planning obviously there's a lot of things that we need to discuss and we don't have to tackle everything all at once we can address them in pieces\nWe just found that most people just haven't even begun thinking about all the pieces that we do in our everyday job this is what we do this and what we have a passion for and this is why we're in this business is to think of those details in to help people come up with solutions\nSo if you're realizing that your current plan doesn't have all the answers to these questions this is your chance now to correct that and get truly a comprehensive plan in place all you have to do is call us and we'll set time aside on the calendar to meet with you\nAnd that number is eight four four four to four plan\nTo get

Waterloo, Iowa city or a Cedar Falls\nAll points in between Tony loves to drive so you'll see mountains to you as well so you can get yourself on a calendar for a no cause no obligation consultation as we mentioned before eight four four four to four plan their offices located in Cedar Rapids so if you're in Cedar Rapids hearing us it makes it pretty easy as well\nAll right guy so let's play a little fine print fiasco if you will [laughter]\nVia the old saying you know you guys have heard this is that the the sales brochure can give us\nAnd the fine print can take it the way so let's talk about a few things that we hear from people that we've heard in the past\nWhere you know just the fine but they didn't pay enough attention and maybe they got bit by the fine print and that's why it's such a good idea to have a coach and some and a team on your side help\nKind of help you avoid some of these pitfalls so we'll start with long term care insurance um a lot of times people get pretty frustrated because they'll get a big rate increase and they just didn't realize that that's possible because they didn't read through the fine print or weren't talked to a throat properly\nOr absolutely mark you know and it's it's very critical before you set up anything insurance wise that you know\nGrandmother pros and cons of what can potentially happen in the future just when you look at what insurance is whether it's long term care or a life insurance its contract between you and the insurance company they're going to base your costs um their mortality people's basically age and health\nAnd what may happen is the way it can be structured\nNew could have a variable benefit in other words the benefit may decrease over time it may stay the same or may increase it but I have some sort of inflation feature to it but along those terms if they're going to give you more of a benefit but he also have to look at what am I going to\nYeah a little bit of extra you know at the top as it is going to be a little bit more expensive than other policies but that expense is going to stay level for my entire life or my premiums going to go up based upon the increase in benefits that I'm expected to have\nAnd then last part is your benefits may state level but your premiums go up they may turn to give you a low price up front\nWith the expectation that you're going to pay higher and higher costs as you get older you are going to absorb some of that higher cost of insurance that the company the insurance companies looking to build into it so\nYou got to really look at it and compare apples to apples or you could begin to integrate very low rate without realizing ten Fifteen Twenty years down the line that rate's gonna increase and that's really where the fine print on these types of things comes into play\nOkay so definitely want to make sure that you're having those conversations understanding and having those expectations set as this hold true Jason as well for maybe the annuity side where the fees wind up being altered I guess it's probably not an all types of annuities maybe more the variable\nWell yeah you're absolutely correct in that that variable annuity typically have higher fees than any other types of annuities that are out there but it can go across the spectrum of investments as well for higher fees than what you're anticipating you know perception doesn't quite always meet expectations and that's\nOne of the things that kind of irks me when when we sit down with people and uh they have other investments somewhere else and they didn't fully understand how those invest and worked\nOr what the expense is worth to it or what the the ease of where to a certain rider on certain things because what you want to do is you don't want to just show the flashy parts of what an investments going to do you want to work through the good and bad because there is not one golden egg investment out there\nEvery time you get a benefit from an investment you're taking away something else and so\nYou got to set up expectations to understand what the fees are going to be inside of the investment because there might be a really good reason why you're using something that has a little bit higher fees\nBut typically when it comes to annuities the variable annuities you will have higher expenses inside of there because you have a mortality expense ratio\nThat's in there that kind of protects the the principle that you put into the variable annuity contract but you also might have some additional riders that you didn't or were unaware of when you first set it up and those can add to those fees that you're going to be paying every single year\nOn top of that variable annuity typically use what are called sub accounts which basically come down to being mutual funds and those mutual funds will also have\nExpenses involved with them as well and so if you're going to use a variable annuity you want to make sure that your understanding what those expenses are and having a financial advisor talked through each and every level of the to see if you're comfortable with it for the benefits that you're going to receive",
