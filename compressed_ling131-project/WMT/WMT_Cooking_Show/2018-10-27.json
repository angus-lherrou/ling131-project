sooner or later well\nIt's a little too soon yet because roses are generally the last thing ever drop their leaves yeah do you notice that grade yeah they'll be green clear up until Thanksgiving sometime\nSo that makes it kind of hard to cover them about what you need to do a ... if you've got ... on top of the soil you need to pull that away Iraq's of whatever pole and right away and then make a mound\nOf soil about a foot and a half up on the plant and I know this is a lot of work but if you did it arose is adamant essential part of do it so\nYou had to step out you're making amount or soil up around the stems and then the next thing you do is either open leaves or straw tucked in tightly around the rest of the plant okay\nAnd you can you know ... is secure that by using a a soldier made out of chicken wire or if you don't get a lot of when you can just package around there [noise]\nDon't ever use anything that is solid like a bucket or the rose ... the worst thing you

seriously where I was like\nOh I'm going to make these potatoes and I didn't think about I don't even potatoes that was and it took me like an hour and a half to clean them and slice the Oh yes and so I ended up making a ball for oil I mean it was huge [laughter]\nI was it was John norm is this thing was it was like a big ball of potatoes just rolling along ... ... the big thing though is is when you get the potatoes and onions and they're together oh man it is so\nGood oh God yeah so for breakfast you can do that if you went to another thing you can do is right before cooking if you want it before putting it in there\nWhat are you can do is you could take some scrambled eggs and you could put it in there well sure now the thing is is that you got to be very judicious about that because you don't want the extra completely overcook 'cause you know out last it smells when\nThey get the soul free over over cooked eggs so um\nYeah that's good stuff that is good stuff but big camper when you were kids did you go go camping and all we all went camping I mean\nBecause what do you do is seven kids yeah um that's that's almost free yeah [laughter] and it was just always funny because of course we always had a station wagon and we would back out of the driveway and\nWe'll be so loaded on just you know down and scrape and it was shocking and but it was fun and I ... I managed at that time to find a curling iron that didn't require electricity was back up to allow because you know you're kind of getting to the age where it's like oh I\nGot to do my hair I'm Out in the middle of yeah the but yeah we had some fun times camping and all that we had one time where it it rained overnight and we ended up kind of he woke up floating somewhat that was that flying squirrel I think tank and ready yeah but one of the things that we always made and then we even made\nThem at home I'm\nNot necessarily eat over a campfire but we take the foil packet and care point kind of spray down yeah and then you would um just chop up sites have some carrots and potatoes and onions\nAnd then um put a hamburger Patty on and and then um I'll just put a big\nChunk of butter on there which you know there's no healthy their photo but um\nAnd then you put that on you'd make the little packet and put it on the grill or the campfire and cook it that way and the flavors just blend together so nicely and it was so\nEasy were seems it's never been telling my mom did that with a she turned the maverick er Patty into like a little bowl and then the frozen vegetables I Love that and then you try gravy mix on top of that that's something that area yeah that was that was very good that was like a regular for when I was a kid that was a regular\nOr something we would have all the time it was it was not bad at all now\nI'm reading to go camping much effect we didn't go camping at all the closest we ever got I mean I Can't maybe one time with a buddy ...\nBut I it wasn't until I was an adult then I went camping because really yeah I wasn't in scouts and uh I just I it was like it was something it was very foreign to me it\nWas strange though 'cause we had caught some IEDs sleeping bags but it wasn't for that was just like if you if you know sleep downstairs\nI don't know that we never had caught we always just had tents and yeah but\nBut the camping this time of year is to me I like it because you've got those temperatures like right now mid forties ... have you got a good sleeping bag it's perfect perfect weather if you've got a horrible sleeping bag you're going to measure paint all got to be paying a but the breakfast in the morning that is something that is always great pay off\nOh yes and then a lot of people now are getting into the thing where you boil the pot of water and you make your little um letting the bag and just throw it in there what where you take I've never\nHeard of them are you serious they used to do it kind of at camp courageous uh where you would go through um you have your like plastic bag right like zip line as it block and then you would put in their ... I'm like you are one or two eggs you know just kinda ... up a little bit\nAnd then you would take whatever you wanted like if you wanted sausage probably wanted you would peppers yeah mushrooms and you would then put that in the bag seal it and then drop it in the pan of water and it just cooks like that\n... if I did not know that yeah I wasn't aware of that's really it's really good idea yeah I was just a little mini ... drop in the water huh I'm gonna have to I'm going to check that out because that's something that for years the problem is like a jury that morning I mean\nI don't have time to read so typically now over most recently it's been um [noise] just cereal for breakfast cereal but in a granola bar chicks healthy though it is healthy but it's like man I Want that protein I'm just crave protein all the time what kinds of um I don't know it's a it was um\nCostco surreal it's in there but like a granola puff okay ... not sweet it's not like sugar donated no it's not crazy sweet it's a it's an older pop rice and strawberries for the phone and I tend not to like the sweet ones anyway I don't either grape nuts but I like rape that's\nThe thing I noticed in the ... the more the the older I get\n... my palate is does taste things differently like for example\nI put a couple of package sugar on it\nWas just no big deal\nBut then the va later it gets in the ... gets more it takes on a like a salty flavor almost\n... the great great nuts is\nI don't know it's I've tried it several times and it it's just different John one ... I Want to like it yeah but and and then you know they have great nuts flakes but like what's the point exactly yeah those are gold salt flakes fight and yeah\nI I ... minutes for the challenge yeah kind of because you think that you should like um if you're an adult I get a ... on these [laughter] another say there it's the texture\nAnd that's one of the series we can eat hot and cold as well yeah ... which is good what would happen in Cedar Rapids put into cereal bar\nYou know I've heard of those yeah this is a bigger city yeah leisure you go by and they have how many cereals yeah you just dispense into your bowl whatever you want and\nYou know you twenty bucks it's all you can eat cereal and they ... they've got whole milk two percent one percent ... they've got goat milk they've got all ... they've got lactose free milk\nIn cars you know didn't why we didn't end up on the bottom of the river right\nNo I visited that I did is becoming a strange things when you think about it [laughter] so ah last night it was a New York strip on a New York strip was sauteed vegetables and um roasted the sweet potatoes\nNice so good loves sweets so that it was delicious and I did that they'll tell you the sweet potato thing coming up here in the second let's go to the phones\nAnd uh say good morning walk them to the open line your first caller today which first name where are you calling from\n[noise] Hi this is Nancy calling from Lansing direct hey Nancy how are you today\nWhere good a good and I and right now just carry how much I enjoyed Christine any uh every Saturday for many years you've been listening W.
