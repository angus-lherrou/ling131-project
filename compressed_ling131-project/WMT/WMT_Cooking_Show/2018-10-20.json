passing games a hundred and twenty fifth in the country it's not good on a perfect day they're going to be going into a an incredible when twice today in this game\nLate Stanley I last couple of games is passing game it looks like it's really come into its own but now you come into ... you've got that kind of ... we all know what the wind does it can it can just kinda swirls around a bit how does that change what's gonna happen how does that change in eight Stanley's game how does that change the Iowa game overall\nI think a ... when they go into the wind I think it will adapt it a little bit but one thing is he has such a strong arm you know you don't want to have a pass hanging out there if you're joining the say you know from the left hash marks the right out you don't want any of those where you're going into the wind that that pick six city but you know other than that\nI think I can handle it Maryland can't\nNow one of the most fascinating things is no team in the country has its most as much they're down passing or does Iowa right now and they you know in Stanley leads it\nBy a hundred and Fifteen yards he has five hundred Seventy three on third down and he has the most twenty plus touched a twenty five yards at Fifteen plus yards ... a ...\nAnd he's the best parallel park or in the Big Ten African\n[laughter] I guess I didn't ask that I think I'd like to go next week they make that I mean these are now twenty dollars an hour by you want to give people read it [laughter] I just got back\nFrom the athletic speaking or even working we read your work at\nYeah at the athletic dot com I mean we have a you know all kinds of\nCollege football coverage in this week a was a lot of fun writing some of the story so I'm looking into those numbers I mean it's just incredible to see what I was able to do and author down considering two years ago\nThere were a hundred and twenty third that four hundred thirty two yards on third out all year they have a daily by itself has five Seventy three and six games so it's been fun looking those numbers up writing about it\nYards on third now and you'd never thought he'd been told her six weeks ago that we'd be talking about that\nAnd in Iowa and get it that we're not going to visit with the voice of doc I often hear coming up here to the uh Freddy frozen custard if they were here where it's a quarter mile rows and rows of folks in the Iowa barbecue company or here on a friday town trailer state's getting ready for Iowa in Maryland here more in just a moment\nOf friday's original double with cheap too and it's

eight hundred K. excise see news radio six hundred WMD T\nO L high atop the press box here ... stadium just down the road from where we are check in with the voice of the ... guys Gary Dolphin rocky by\nFriday's will tell you all about them in just a little bit ... we find you well in warm and out of the wind is cool Saturday morning well we'll see adjusted\nIt's you know a couple of hours before game time the wind is starting to pick up I'm looking at the flags across the way a\nIn front of children's hospital on top of those he stands in their weapon up pretty good the good news is there is no rain skies as you know beautiful clear the sun is up and that'll keep things as toasty as they need to be that was one of those games where you where maybe two or three layers\nAnd then you start peeling them off maybe by half time everybody gets in here sitting next to each other and cozy uncomfortable and hopefully the hawks are have a nice lead by the intermission but the other one's going to be a factor of how big of a factor I think there's\nToo much made of that are only because that's what the coaches and players say now the wind a skirt parents should\nOn his radio show the other night uh the wind affects the football game more than anything else including snow ice rain sleet it doesn't matter he said the wind\nAnd when you think about it uh it it really a cripples the passion game or limits the passing game if it's gusting to forty or forty five let's hope it's not a if it's nice and breezy okay a can a stadium as you know seems to get taller and taller with the north end zone\nEnclosure now that although it isn't quite finished a that will knock down that northwest when considerably this afternoon for teams either heading into it or thinking they have it at their back\nAnd see they've got the big jumbo Tron up there now to since last time we got together maybe that'll help break down some of the ...\nYeah that hallway that open air space is now covered up ah now I don't think the jumbo Tron will be working today they haven't plugged it in yet but they've got the screen up\nYou know in the old days when you use to head out to the drive in movie theater out in the middle of a field that's what it looks like right now just added should be it should be helpful because that thing goes another story or to above the top layer of stance\nThat's just my personality although most of them will a person you know I Love being a ... whenever like I'm In the ... real real good movie notice on its own sons who everybody that's how I Am\nSo it's like a fun guy this team looks like they're having a lot of fun after scoring forty plus points\nTo road games in a row by the way that's the first time that's ever happened to finish second of road games forty plus voice in the same season with Justin and it's got documents from the athletic here on the friday on trailer staged I mean in the course like comfort care bumper brigade seem just looks like it's having fun and it's got they've\nGot great chemistry you could see that in the way they interact with one another and\nAnd uh you know they they do have big personalities at different spots and then not forced on anybody and at times in the past you could see that where somebody's maybe they're not comfortable in that role or just doesn't have that kind of personality is forced to take it on and it hasn't worked\nBut when you have you know guys like uh have you ever since we're setting money Jones who are the life of the party who can really uh live in things up\nIt keeps everybody loops and what do you have an office that's most I you know multi layered here you know we got it in a passing game that is right now I'll pass basing the running gain and that's only because the other teams are trying to take the run away I think you're seeing a team that's enjoying themselves because they're having a lot of success\nHere finally forcing other teams to decide okay if we go nine in the box these guys had actually beat us with the passing game\nYeah and that's what's happened the last two weeks two weeks ago Minnesota went there going eight no matter what and I was wide receivers beat him last week Indiana blessed and left the titans and single coverage in both men were not or George receiving\nMhm and as far as the big picture\nEntered your favorite on just because the\nThe work so hard you know the guys just a guy when he's on the field energizes your to and it just makes things happen I'm only ... says the same thing on special teams\nSo you know you might just caught the steps and you don't appreciate the value of of what they do for a football team uh employers like those two guys that have such positive attitude and they're they're tough physical players are by nature to me they just kind of picked everybody up and\nYou know ... the most vivid example I'm going to be on this program ... last Twenty years history of a guy who just you know energize the football team and that that's certain players have that ability ... degree\nOr if he's not big on physical but he's he's reckless lots you don't know do float in their life is big and ... a physical and there's not to\nDo those guys really I think just self help energize the team and and give them a little bit of extra drive\nNow get a three a bit of a curve ball is that white joined young he was in coming into the second half to bring that energy or no and he last week obviously start started with the with the injury to Kelly Mart\nYeah the Kelley Martin is the most complete running back on the team I mean he's able to do so many different things um you know catch the ball back he's got a good person explosive ... but the thing is what he comes in it's instant energy and he runs like a bowl and sometimes I mean I remember the opener\nThat was perfect timing it was hot you got an opponent that you know getting a little bit more down and then you bring in your big physical running back and they can't take him\nAnd I think he's got he has that you ... and now that it's getting cold and you know you have Kelley Martin in in ... in sergeant McKay sergeant in there for a little while\nWhy not throw touring in there and all and then they get something different and I think that's what he's more of the change of pace back they need it's just in reverse to what we're used to ... to the the big tough guy Shawn Daniels in Akron being the the a counter punch in that it's the other\nWay around injury wife today um some of these guys back\nNickname and it sounds like he's back and that's going to be important because this team is the last two weeks is what two more of a five defensive back look a called their pay cash personnel\nAre but when you're playing a runs base team like this you want to have more heavy duty linebackers and nicotine it's the best linebacker so he's coming back it does not sound like Jack ... is is\nThere yeah [noise] what do you see happening across the street here in a two and a half hours\nI think they're going to slow down Maryland they're going to force Maryland to throw their stacked box Marilyn won't be able to handle that\nIowa will probably be more work than like on our beds and less explosive except when the winds that their back and I you know I I pick die with thirty one sixteen I think that maybe a little high scoring on the Maryland down to things\nUh but uh you know this is a tough physical team though this is not a ... Maryland team they are very very physical so you have to be cognizant of that if I can bring its usual physicality\nI'm either guy wins it probably decisively\nThis is a Maryland program though who we have to admit is far ahead of where everybody thought they'd be given the disarray that happened\nIn the offseason without a doubt it's really impressive to see what Matt candidate done I mean you know I think next week is when they uh make their final ruling I think It's Tuesday on what they're going to do to the or\nA coach DJ jerk and how they're going to proceed so I think the fact that they've got more when they they beat that you know the blackout of Minnesota they uh attack since his ranked ... in the country on that yeah you know so they've done some good things and then\nYou know they lost a Michigan Michigan is a really good team and uh you know so at temple which was really inexplicable problem is there a hundred and twenty fifth and passing and it's really windy day ... so that that works against them as well as the environment\nMaking them one dimensional which is what the opponent usually tries to do how do we find your work Scott\nYou go to the athletic dot com and ah we have a you click on the college football tab and then ... pops all those teams look on the on the tiger hockey and you'll sit in the right to Iowa\nOnce you get upstairs in where it's warm thanks a lot right appreciate like Sandy appreciate it got document with the athletic joining us here on the fried town trailer stayed at the corner of Melrose in about ... what the Iowa barbecue company as we continue with the corps like comfort care\nBrigade after they check game day traffic [noise]\nNews radio six hundred W emptied takes you to this guy for this Hawkeye game day traffic report presented by Kippur insurance services of Cedar Rapids here's the voice of the Iowa State patrol in town to become a little\nOn creating the normal campaign traffic but a couple of them I really like a broken down south of\nThe ... cannot forever hurting road what kind of marker north everybody thought they were I told her here in the rye has got to be a problem now but maybe three that traffic is already in Korea [noise]\nParking lot looking around and there but we have no access to this report is ... ... acre park on\nThe goal is to get you to the games they play a game day traffic reports presented by Kippur insurance services of Cedar Rapids on news radio six hundred WMD T hey hawk ranch\nWe see white knuckle driving because your insurance isn't up today with another accident or chicken make your insurance premiums skyrocket why are you insuring your possessions would bubble wrap when you could call the Kippur insurance agency\nEven if you're miles behind cheaper insurance understand your frustration and get you up to speed and give you a peace of mind call three one night three nine six two zero zero to for a pre insurance review yes I said free go ahead and joined the guys and leave the worrying to Kippur insurance go three one nine three nine six two zero zero to\nBlackberry wind from tests all rich winery is a ... wind burning was mellow Barry flavors reminiscent of blackberry jam it's we could be used as dessert by itself were shipped any time blackberry wine is one of our most\nPopular wines Anna does one several golden double gold medals and competition\nWalk very wine is available at winery and many were led to an eye on if you don't see tests all rich blackberry one in your fever store ask\nThe manager together for you pass all rich winery is located in light on highway one sixty three between ... and it was open seven days a week from Monday to friday nine to six Saturday from ten to six and Sunday afternoon to her website ... castle rich dot com\nBlackberry one from tests all rich winery simply extraordinary\nWill proceed in honey company offers the widest selection of seed in the tri state area welders carry my conceived to G six eighty five one hundred and Ninety acorn hybrid which is a two year proven performance leader in the Iowa State trial\nMy ... is why we adapted with high yield potential and very stable astronomical family owned and operated swells are seen as serve area farmer's since Nineteen fifty five gold and today\nWe're all your seat beads eight hundred for seven zero thirty three twenty five\n... dabbling in Nineteen Seventy eight [noise] born in the Rockies were the only thing more refreshing than your current events what Mike ... is longer and go home for a lighter Christ will turn comb through insurance brilliant clarity frightened I'm\nPackage for ... freshman the concern for more nothing less than the world's ... ... ...
