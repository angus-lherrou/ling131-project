you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grams so that that's pretty good\nYou're in good shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape as is his way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you gotta way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAlways shall wanting to go get a loan from the bank and by the car right okay um\n\nWell I mean there's two there's two things that people here want one is is she's grown person and you know we don't tell her grown kids what to do we merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown\nAnd the answer to that would be no and you are working to get on a day your son is working to get out of that you guys have made the decision that being in debt on cars and these other things is a bad idea it's not good for your finances\nAnd to turn around and put her in dead or participate in an activity it's not an act of love and so um\nI appreciate her sentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she is right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty\nFive an hour and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing you harm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that\nAnd you know and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right to think that I'm On line but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good\nFor you I Love you know I wouldn't sell it to her okay if\nI were in power in your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing that that did it I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI mean we have a hundred dollars a day and what is your house rolling out on a one eighty\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have the hundred thousand paid do you think\nWe're looking at two years\nThat's about as long as they should take max within fifty a year making one eighties not exactly\nSo deeply deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers four thousand dollars doesn't matter much\nYou could just show or the car for four or five thousand okay and not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay but if you want to sell it to our sheep\nAnd just help her um because the four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much out of a hundred you follow me or what moves the need a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast\nSo given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into bad\nYou're going to have if you're gonna do that you're going to do it somewhere else 'cause I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that\nBrings you harm because I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are obstinate little rebellious ... seriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear love coming from you that way then there's something\nWrong but I in your case what the numbers on my if you don't want to show it to him cheap that's okay too but he didn't one's fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and I'll bet that night third at filling out college applications with my daughter my son's already in college in\nRight now I'm just like how did we get him in so much debt already he's in two years\nA hit that he started his second year of school and um my daughter was like I said in the fall but he already has um like ten thousand dollars and a and school loans and then we have fourteen thousand an apparent python [noise]\nMhm and it so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school\nOr Washington state university\nOkay what is the tuition\nAbout well the first year it twenty seven tuition it is a around [noise] I Can't even think\nTwelve eight and ... twelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close among all off\nBut it should be about there in state tuition and that at school or something like that the national average is about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you're nothing in the house trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay is it working\nYes he works about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise]\nOkay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget and nice to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you guys help him sit down and figure out what you can contribute to the equation so between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really are and the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's

wife is a physician and compensation from insurance companies and one has gone down considerably and we um we built our dream home and move them about six and a half years ago\nAnd it's a wonderful place but we are becoming a house for because of the you know whack of income so it won't wash your household income before and what is it now\nIt was about four eighty and this year was about two Seventy five\nOkay and most of that is her\nCorrect I work two part time jobs and care for three children ... and how much do you own your home\nAbout eight forty and what is the payment on that\nAre

when you factor in taxes insurance just consider what harm\nGotcha okay right and do you have no other debt or is it\nOh no we have about a hundred and fifty which is a mostly credit cards and student loan okay\nWe've kind of accumulated those credit cards over the last few years of trying to figure out you know whether we were going to work ... research shows you know you know return to previous

five percent number of Fifteen year\nIt'll be a little bit under actually okay\nThat's what yeah that clears the debt and everything okay here's all the yeah I Am definitely doing that and um the ... that all sounds like it's very wise uh especially to the extent that you\nUm feel like that this is permanent is changing companies ... and there's nothing you can do to fix it\nWell not but you only have so given how I had him in high school and I didn't have them for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years where they gain weight and that's when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open up that might be\nOkay so what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what\nYou have about forty three pound them and I'm Still going I'm going into still doing going strong laugh\nOkay okay good news is good for you well done thank you yeah I mean when that kind of pain no you can learn to do a lot of different things that are out there um so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um\nIn terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh the truth is is that the financial troubles we're going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do\nSo when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween two and six thousand dollars\nPer yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty between sixty five I\nYou know and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical on out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that were that we we we paid off twenty five thousand we thought about thirty left so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah\nBecause you take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm a you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem\nBut if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some progress while you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um\nYou know you're going to be a new man in so many ways right\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I've a kidney stone for the next forty years out of I just ... that just is not a that's not a tenable\nScenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way in the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that's coming up you know well that's just going to be\nThat is what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let let let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back oh bless you sir wow ouch ow Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how're you\nGuys have cable either but I say I
