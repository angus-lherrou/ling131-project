time so between eighty six thousand to Ohio has six thousand dollars to and what do you do for a living\nAnd I am a ... ethic operating room nurse in St Joseph good for you ... what kind of debt was Seventy pounds so uh they're combination it was an equitable distribution of or a debt of with my ex husband so credit cards\nTime share bunk bed I'm you name it uh he lock and also some of it are divorced a lawyer's fees\nOh a little bit of everything yeah well it added up after I saw what happened to put you almost truck to get out of the show aggressively twenty three months ago\nSo I'm actually it started early twenties Fifteen um\nAh when my ex husband and I decided we're going to end the marriage and eventually file for divorce\nUm I felt really the sense of defeat and failure friending the marriage ... and uh we're both from the Philippines you came here in America two thousand two and we're both operating room nurse is we have between the two of us six figures of salary but we also have\nAccumulated sixty acres of debt and run and I remember one day um how is driving down from work um and\nJust an overwhelming panic and I drive\nA lot of um billboards mhm but only

Googled you and I\nTotally agree with all your principles and you're a ... but I Do take that time because why am I going to pay a hunted I think forty nine dollars at that time on debit or cash when I'm already deep in debt and so I didn't buy that kid but then after\nA few weeks I was still in panic and so I remembered you and I said okay I'm just going to buy a kitten\nSo I bought a ticket\nI Love audio CD so I listen to your audio CD center remembered crying in the car when I listened to the dumping debt\nVt when you were a when you were screaming yell or run run run run like I really want to run and then I cried more when I heard the role of insurance where the dad or die before he met his first born\nBut he was able to take care of his family and I was thinking well what if I die today or tomorrow what will my kids to be and so\nI sat down on 'em I rearrange our debts from small is the largest and then um things escalated I have to file for divorce on February twenty sixteen and then um July twenty sixteen um July sixteen after\nWe met with my lawyer and we did the distribution of debts that done in my car\nAfter the meeting start date July sixteenth plenty sixteen\nAnd

doubted myself but for a little bit\nWhat the actual tax bills you gonna be if you do Charlotte and then you look up and go well I hate this thing and I don't want to be in a real real estate and so I'd rather pay a little bit of capital gains and I'll have all that money the rest of that money sitting to do something I Want to do\nThose I don't want to do this anymore and if that's the case then you know it's it's not as painful as people think it is usually Josh is with us Josh is in Memphis, Tennessee Josh how are you\nThinking of taking my call scripture because you're too sir how can I help [noise]\nWell I have about a foil on a show about a nine thousand two hundred and thirty six hundred thirty dollars from school bet\nI'm from an advanced degree and just kind of really looking at the best advice on how to pay that off I Know that you're not a fan of the public service loan forgiveness program and I'm\nWondering maybe about income driven plan where the government might pay for than of unpaid interest monthly or can power outage or just go ahead and getting down to it knocked out as quick as you can\nNow the third one is about one year we had a bit faster that way what your income dropped\nOr after taxes that bring about your workout change what do you do for a living I'm a nurse practitioner at a nonprofit hospitals here\nOkay what I'm saying Judah okay cool our actual won't wonderful wonderful place um the um well\nI don't know whether you can pick up extra time there or not but ... practitioner you're very marketable and you can pick up other times you can work as much as you want to work as much as you're able to work logistically\nUm and I would do get out and and I would just try to pay this off in about two years and be done with it and is that a monkey and around with some kind of a government plan here's the problem with the public service loan forgiveness program\nIt isn't happening\nLast year thirty to thirty thousand people put in an application for their loans to be forgiven\nNinety ... Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's those are the odds you want you know I Want I don't want to wait ten years only to find out that the government's scam me basically\nSo I'm not I think you just work like a crazy man pick up as many hours as you can pick up the great news is you're nursing\nJust a wonderful career path because you can add hours or add you know pick up some ER time or whatever you need to do I don't know on the short term when you make sixty thousand dollars extra money so fast his firm believer in two years you can just make sixty thousand extra\nYou know I'm again you'll be working a lot but it does just be done with this and just you know I'm\nA I'm I'm a band aid off fast guy I mean just get it done I take the pain and get it done and then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you got to go again a great career track so you're going to be in really good shape\nThank you Josh for what you do at Saint Jude good stuff All right Tim is uh weather's in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five and my car is about to go but I'm trying to office faith and pay off this debt as quick as possible for the question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nInto my fault or the K shed doing all that down to about one to two percent it started throwing money at this loan right now I'm doing about a hundred dollars a week at it mhm just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I ... was your opinion should also thank you for so much\nI you know you've got to videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot of bad decisions like buying\nA crappy house and going into like a twenty thousand dollar Carlo show I really appreciate that\nCool good so well thank you um what do you make what's your income\n[noise] I Do about twenty three thousand dollars after taxes but that's not including the overtime I guess\nYou know what are you there um while they're okay to get a lot over time off for the most part can you get more Oh absolutely you know\nShowing a temporary basis you could really load up your overtime and clean up the ... very very quickly and save up and get you know because your car save up your emergency fund and then save up and move up and car and cash\nThat will be my learning to do now that would be my first three goals with what I heard and then and only then what are restart\nMy four oh one K. so what I'm saying is temporarily not forever but maybe for a year or maybe even to completely stop your four O. one K. to become completely debt free builds your emergency fund those three to six months of expenses and then\nOnce you've done that didn't save up and pay cash for a car and that's a step three and rebate and then you move to babysit for and restart their four O. one K. and then you start putting Fifteen Percent of your own come into retirement but at that point you don't have any payments and you're driving a paid for decent car\nAnd these are all a really good place for you to be\nAnd that that's the direction I Would tell you to move towards show yeah while we have people working these baby steps Tim unless your own baby step forward telling you to temporarily temporarily temporarily stop your four O. one K.\nInvesting Andrew is with us in Dallas texas hey Andrew how are you\nI'm doing well how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh not a whole lot I recently took a new job we're making a good amount of money and I'm very curious about ... stadium more invest more\nMhm okay um what are you out of debt\nI'm going to get us are going to get off the whole nine yards should\nDo you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAre good at twenty grand she currently\nOkay so what would you be saving for them\nAnd that's the whole thing I knew John ... wrote about five days a week so buying a house kind of out question right now mhm so I get the big question what should be saving for said he couldn't be more in the Roth IRA right by our age or something I mean you look for towards future would you recommend\nWell you're at what we call baby step for she'd be starting to put Fifteen Percent of your income away for retirement or beyond that if you wanted to start piling some money into an investment to buy a home later that wouldn't be a bad thing but today it doesn't sound like you're on the market for home yeah\nYeah so it sounds like him to get your retirement savings started\nAnd a Fifteen Percent of your income going into that take your gross income before taxes point one five as Fifteen Percent\nAnd then get that started in your four one K. do it in a Roth if you can match or if you can if you can't uh than let's do look at a raw on your own to a Roth IRA on your own and let's make sure you're getting that money set aside if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income throughout your whole life into good mutual funds in a retirement plan you'll be a millionaire usually a multi millionaire actually\nAnd um so we we can just at least get that started and then beyond that if you want to save towards the house or even invest some money in aside\nMutual fund that's not a retirement account to use for a house later you could do that well let's get Fifteen Percent of started and I don't think it should go and get your head it in the right direction so it's\nA good question man thank you for joining us appreciate

saving for that main stop paying for it [laughter]\nHow old is your lawyers\nWell it was both of our okay alright really started in about a hundred and forty eight years ago and we were willing it

of what happened and so\nWhat is the secret to getting out of debt what do you tell people when they say you paid off all your debt when you sleep it off your desk and they say how'd you do that\nWell I think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I started to really look at the number one thing and then we got really focus so we use every dollar and we're just all in yeah\nYeah when she went and got her second job started work on that and I was like well I Can't let her\nKnow do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible as well okay All right and she got involved in the budgeting yep so I'm the spender and uh it definitely is the the nerve gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\nThat affects the saver get involved in well in both of your work on it they're just accountability\nAbsolutely that was the only thing I was gonna say is keeping their accountability accountable yeah they're um we also um maybe like a vision board um we had like chains we really got the the kid who was involved and you and we take links are chains\nThat have have them involved and they love that guy who who so how'd you guys get connected us my dad and I got ... and you know\nSo when you kicked it into gear two years ago he was your cheerleader\nAbsolutely yeah and the mom and we have we got bugs get rain we're we're on fire\nAt our church did financial peace we went there once or twice oh wow yeah so just to keep involved you know I think the other thing was we if we listen to you on TALK cast on YouTube Live enough that uh our kids learn your phone number before they learned ours [laughter]\nOkay well they can call anytime\nThat's fun I Love\nGoing to say when it had the dream was to get a dog and I am not a dog person very and we got a dog and we just happened to name him Ramsey\nAll dog is Ramzi now he's a

and that's how he scraped up the hundred dollar\nTwenty five dollars or not and I'm okay right Raman noodles convenient gotcha so what's your household income\nUm between thirty and forty thousand dollars a year my husband's international guard and I wanted to get to go to our duty we make an extra thousand dollars a month [noise] bang when he's home he works for my parents Showtime and have make about thirty out here\nWhat does he do for a living me about your mhm okay\nSo what's he want to be doing ten years or Twenty years from now that makes them a lot more money\n[noise] um\n'cause y'all are starving to death [laughter] I ... I talked to him about it and he's like oh I don't really I Dreamed that would be nice to have more money [laughter]\nHe acted\nHears I'm always worked really hard we got married when he was Eighteen and he worked about sixty hours a week then on the corner and held it he he gets a hard worker and he'd do anything for me\nHa ha ha\nUm\nI wasn't questioning how hard he works as questioning and making money\nYou see the difference yes I work real hard to you do yeah a lot\nLike this week already sixty hours and It's Wednesday so I'm a Thursday or whatever it is even forgot what it is or we go so anyway but I'm\nA I don't always do that every week but you know you've got to look at things and say for the labor I'm putting out on the time I have away from my family and the stress and the strain on my body in my mind and my emotions what am I getting paid in Europe the answer is not much\nIn this part of what you are facing as your income challenge\nIs that right okay\nAnd I'm so why why does that bring tears\n[laughter] I feel like we've just been we've had to go on\nAnd you know like I Try to be we try to be financially responsible you know we we've never spenders\nYeah I don't think ... I don't think you're irresponsible\nThinking maybe I really I think you're doing really good because you don't have the money\nI feel like at this point I had hoped it could be a little bit more had detail paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and the other side and you know have you noticed that didn't even ask you about the I'll go out in your case yeah and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good they're\nReally we should have babies that number you're down in about six months\nI think you're right I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we only makes them more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollar is you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something what are we going to do to create some additional income short term short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job in the local library but after I pay for childcare I only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [noise]\n[noise] so that's that's not that's not the answer then right [noise] and we've got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise] yeah and he's got to have a game plan and\nI don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butchering the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be Bush's but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nThe accents\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this cause your parents were doing it or\nYou know that's kind of exactly what happened\nYou know and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white border of second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that and you went to went today and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way\nBut it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issues and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing there's not much income yeah so and he\nTold us what how do we go about things like that but my parents that if you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient for them and it's so hard on my dad if you got heart problem to take over all of the work that they're very very small operation\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for\nThis is not working for your bad because it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and it working but I don't know I\nMean the way I bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here yeah and we're not going to continue to do this anymore\nAnd you don't have to do it today but you you know you can say you know my husband is going to we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing 'cause that's really his dream\nBecause here's the thing was somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it okay and I you know but ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life\nLeft out that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell this or close right yeah and and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home [noise] [noise] well\nThey do not like we did by the ... were not like we're not at all part of the owners of it\nI Know but the owner cannot operate it without this particular employees what you said oh well I guess I Need a new employee or then you talk about selling it to you or giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about there's a lot of different\nWays out of this mess but continue into the same thing is not a way out of the ...\nAnd um so ... got changed and let the change the day and that's a change turkey turkey and nobody has to be mad and throw weight around or say anything unkind\nBut we just have to lay say you know five years from now are we doing some different ten years from now it'll be something doing something different and we are going to make more money there's almost all of them get up and that's where all these fears are coming from stress and now in and out of your dad's good people too and I think July fully understand\nThis is the day Ramsey show

practice itself how much do I have a I have a hundred thousand have and and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really tough to scrape together and other four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year and close it that's you know uh and then by the real estate the second year more than a you know Lisa ... for the first year and we should say here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you haven't obviously have on the belief elderly fabulous into\nI mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money and a year and I think you'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and even if you um took it over ran it for a year\nAt an option to buy put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on them real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money market I Do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that child will have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then\nThe third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um I don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith this business has too much risk with it and even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play then\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here I'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it but the question I don't know what you'll do\nA you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sense\nBut that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones at Tripoli eight to five five two to five uh Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if the term insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three\nShould I go for longer or shorter term well that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical exam and buy a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old and Twenty years you'll have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're gone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave\nAnd come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire [noise]\nDepending on what your household income inch so let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars on a paid for house and no kids at home\nAnd or you die I think your husband could struggle through\nOr reverse it he dies you could probably struggled through seven ourselves hours

needed because your age and nice commission his whole life and this is the day Ramsey show\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nNeeds that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home
