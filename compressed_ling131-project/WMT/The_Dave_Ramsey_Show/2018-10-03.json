though that's good news is very cool so how long have you been married\nUh about two and a half years now okay\nSo it sounds like you've got married and started on this plan so you must have been talking about it even before marriage tell me your story\nSo we have an interesting story we feel like you're going to like this one a lot we um we met about four and a half years ago in Sunday school\nAnd my brother was him and his wife for the coordinators for FAU class at our church that started like fall time that you're\nA million Haley we're the only two single people in there and so when we had to partner up to figure out who the nerd was in the free spend or we just partnered up together and we started dating later that year\nAnd uh yeah so um we we were both doing individual budgets before we were married and of course when we got engaged a leading up to our marriage\nWe sat down and had a conversation about exact numbers and the debt and we we made our goals and so when we came back from the honeymoon which we cashed load and the wedding ... cash five we sat down and had our our first official a budget mating\nAnd set a goal that we were going to be out of debt completely before a second wedding anniversary\nI'll tell you what this place to meet a woman in a financial piece class [laughter]\nIt's a joke the Israel\n\nWe always say we're we're a poster children for Dave Ramsey that fee you hear so\nOh my God I don't know how you could get any more doctrinaire needed than that that's pretty much [laughter]\nIt was wounded on it\nWe were trying to figure out earlier today I said you know one of the best thing about this as we've never had a money five ever and I would say we're probably in the one percent and she said it's probably less yeah I have made couples that ever ever argued for never argued about money\nWell I don't know how many I've met that actually met in a financial piece class [laughter] so we're gonna have to start a financial\nClass for singles [laughter] I should ... yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] oh\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the weddings over there you\nKnow well I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts an indoctrination it through and through what do you tell people when they ask how you get out of debt you paid off a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where are you mad that's not easy\n[noise] well it's not I I think that they get fired with having to back it and having a plan together and they think and put that plant messy\nAnd I'd\nSay for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I could look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\n[noise] um we had a truck right now that's forty five out of an ...\nMile and your household income is what\nI'm way I had to grow out here\nYou know get rid of both them and just get you to be years from now while you get dismissed cleaned up it's not a forever car\nIt it's just a short period of time but if you can ... the huge amount of money you got going out the door on cars and the huge amount of laws are taken every day and appreciation of how fast you're going down in value is just destroying you guys so I I Would just moved down to like to five thousand dollar cars and you\nKnow even if you had a little bit on those and you got a little bit on where you were upside down finance it over its credit union or something to recover their mail that you're in the hole is still a lot less debt than you've got now and you stop the bleeding\n[noise] yeah and I guess I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing that you know a little better\nWhile here and we walk you through it okay let's take the uh thirty two thousand dollar car that's the dead on my car correct\nYeah let's pretend that when you look that car up on the Kelley Blue book that you can private cell that car for um like twenty eight thousand which would be like four thousand in the whole\nI now where do we get to four thousand well you obviously don't have any money you're broke right so you're going to either borrow that from your local credit union or your bank\nAnd you'll be four thousand dollars in debt instead of twenty eight states that have thirty two thousand dollars and that\nSo that's huge progress right there okay and the and then a let's say that I come up to buy the car I hand you a check for twenty eight thousand you put the four thousand you borrowed from the credit union with it and pay the car off that get you the title to give to me the buyer\nMy okay and that's how you do it now who are your lungs with on the cars\nOne after the credit and want to throw out\nOkay the allied deal will will work just like I talked about just now the credit union you may be able to sit down with them and convince them by sitting in person in the manager's office only so not a telephone conversation\nBut you may try to say hey look this is how far we are upside down this car which means that you have a partially secured loan\nAlone is secured by this much the value of the car the rest of this one was in an secured loan right\nYou understand what I'm saying yeah OK then the uh\nAnd so Mr manager all we're asking you to do is to admit that it's an secured by giving us in ... alone for the amount that you're there were in the whole I Want to sell the car and get out of\nDebt and then you\nGot a five thousand dollar loan with credit union whenever the differences are you know at the credit union instead of a forty five thousand dollars or whatever the word whatever the numbers work out to be but I Would dump both of these cars get into some very very cheap cars for a period of time while you're clean this mess up and it's going to take you a couple of years calling us mess up\nAbout five years from now you'll be driving anything you want to drive and you pay cash for it\n[noise] and it's not what health and well it's not open I mean you you can do it mathematically if you just take the steps and sacrifice to\nGet there but you've got to amputate I you know these cars I mean you've got a thousand dollars a month car payments\nAre more probably twelve hundred and um you know it's just it's choking you to death here to feel so much more free when you get rid of those stupid vehicles\nAnd then later on get you whatever you want your drive like no one else will either you can drive like no one else you live like no one else or later you can live and give like no one else ... was with us in San Antonio Hi Betty Lou how are you\nCan you hear me now yes ma'am how can I help\nOkay cool um I was telling your comrade that I felt like on the poster child at sixty two are having a bad financial decisions and not by a semi retirement and the reason I'm calling because I I Am working full time on sixty two um I\nWant to find out how to leverage my situation my income by saving cetera and I have found that to ensure at least a reasonably comfortable retire at which I plan [laughter] about eight years\nShould earn it got too much do you make\nI make a sixty six thousand a year good I'm Out there that do you have\nI add twenty thousand barely pay a lot and I am twenty eight hundred do online vehicle which our pay off by Tobar\nMhm okay so twenty two twenty three thousand dollars in debt making sixty six that's good All right and how much money do you have saved not counting retirement\nOkay so I have the government's version of a far on K which is called ... and I'm sure you're familiar with it and I have about eleven thousand in it and I was\nYou have any money other than that saved\nI have a thousand dollar fine\nOkay good All right cool what do we stop adding to the tea SP temporarily\nYes I I I well I took it down to one percent\nStop temporarily and could concentrate\nOn there's twenty three thousand dollars worth of debt with the airline then you've got squeeze every dollar out because when you don't have any payments then you have control of your most powerful wealth building too\nWhich is your income right now it's all going out in student loans carpet and\nSo we get rid of the car payment you're a student loan payment that we build an emergency fund raising the thousand dollar up to a three to six months of expenses emergency fund baby step three and then maybe step for is saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nAnd um you know where will that leave you is the next question so we'd like sixty six thousand dollars let's just pretend for a second\nAnd Fifteen Percent of that is Ninety nine hundred ... says eight hundred bucks a month\nGive or take nine hundred bucks a month something like that going into retirement um and we start with eleven thousand living out in putting this and the calculators were mumbling All right when the calculator and we're going to do this for say I'm\nI'll just put ten years in there for the phone over there so she would have does she what kind of money we end up with here that would be about a quarter million dollars\nYou would have at retirement and you would be Seventy two at that point um and that's not counting any kind of match from the government a lot of most of us but you don't have a match 'em and that's not counting any raises you get during the next ten years while you're working\nBut if your debt free and buy their own your house will be paid off too by the way um and so if your debt free one hundred percent and you have two to three hundred thousand dollar sitting there\nYou're going to make it I'd like to have you have a lot more but it's not as a whole bunch of for peace from social in security is your only way to retire\nUm and you certainly don't have to buy the cookbook Seventy two ways to prepare outgoing love it you'll be able to eat so you put the income for three hundred grand along with um\nThe income from Social Security in your early seventies and everything is paid for 'em I think you'll be okay uh we're we're past panic mode anyway because we now have a plan I'm going to send you a copy of Chris ... book

journey started um eight years ago that's what I found you back then I used to listen to Suzie Orman read her book than I'm kind of a nerd\nUm went to school for business and I think I'm looking for like a book and personal finance and that's when I came upon the total money make over at first when I read it was like oh okay this sounds interesting but um I mean as I got into it more I really liked what you had\nI started listening to you and that's when I was like hooked 'cause you go straight to the point so I started up paying off my credit cards I had a little bit of credit card debt has student loans small student loan um like three thousand and then I really got intense on paying off my car which at that time with like twelve thousand\nI'm like so that was around eight years I've been on this journey for eight years I've ... at my two kids or what people didn't know was that I was in a relationship that with toxic it was abusive um both verbal and\nPhysical so I'm\nJust being on the plan helped me kind of set myself up to where I didn't have to be in stuck in a relationship\nIn that particular relationship mhm um\nI started I paid off my car started putting money in savings emergency fun because I knew that once you know the relationship ended that I'd be the only one reason you know financially responsible for my kids um which is what happened so five years ago um\nI had an emergency fun I started ... putting money aside\nFor a house luckily I was able to stay with my mom at that time we were staying with my mom um there was a it some domestic abuse and then to the end and\nUm but I had set myself up to where I had no debt so they will six months later to purchase the townhouse so that we're kinda started\nYour amazing I think you you're a survivor I don't know if you know this or not there is a very high correlation between extreme levels are financial control and domestic violence\nSo usually if a guy's this big a jerk yeah abusive verbally and physically he also trust to control use the money and that sounds like what was going on here what am I hearing that right\nYeah oh I'm the one that word so I was able to push you didn't work that they would result in his home so I\n... I read about you got rid of a loser that's awesome [laughter] yeah like I like that where you lose your checks right here in the loser yet\nAnd I have to you know give things to you for putting together this plan so I can\nTell you when did it you're a hero I mean your bus loose from loser bill [laughter] and you go get your car paid off moving with your mom get your emergency fun now you're living in a paid for a house just outside Seattle is worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars oh and by the way you're thirty one [laughter] I think you're incredible\nThank you I don't want to say thank you to are very um she's like my best friend's sister ... not really sister but you know be motivated so\nSo uh there's a twenty six year old out there listening okay that doesn't think she's worthy injuries are punching bag for some loser\nTell her she can make it yeah tell her\nRotten [laughter] are you listening right now\nOh gosh [laughter] um you can do it I mean to set yourself up you you don't need to stay with someone just because of money\n\nYou can pay an eight hundred dollar house payment on thirty eight hundred without working ...\nOr medical five thousand Kay what hello yeah I'm here\nI'm just hearing were voices going from somewhere else\nOh my wife didn't that that may\nOh oh okay good All right so uh um but the the\nThirty eight hundred over the eight hundred is not your problem what where you're paying and rent before\nFour hundred okay\nShow four hundred dollars is breaking you guys are making thirty eight hundred a month\nWell and that's what I mean I'm having\nWe look at our budget multiple times trying to figure out where we can cut we don't have a vehicle payments we have both our cars are paid off\n... um but got medical bills for my daughter are equate to about nine hundred a month [noise]\nMhm [noise] um you have that where the weather you rented or whether you bought though at\nThe house didn't didn't change that the only thing that ... was four hundred dollars a month\nCorrect and you don't have any do you have any other data on your home\nOr go alone um we have six thousand dollars in outstanding medical bills we haven't paid yeah and then unfortunately uh about five thousand dollars on a credit card\nOkay right well you you you've got a tight budget but this is not um\nKnow the the ... I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me every time I was told you ought to buy but this house has not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars and I we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a force of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby\nYeah I mean when you're babies' heart and they're just that's just it just wears you down you know that just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy but the truth is it makes it kind of hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys I pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight\nThat you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus ... minus ... minus water done to leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I think that you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where you are is doable I think you can pull it off no I Would not show your house or would not have bought it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's in your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nUh for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you dead gum writer clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of fans who vacations nope you got a bunch of that\nYou're cleaning up after reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and um help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do it the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you I'm On baby steps which it pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt inside my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise]\nI have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house but I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all towards the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like debt free and when you were if you did the\nUm yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\n[noise] know same thing in\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing as if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing on your home to invest isn't\nIt got it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you got that over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ... ah the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nIn your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately\nReacted but that's a hard thing to me that's where that's at risk bart that ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went whoa that's crazy in your mind right you know and that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes\nI Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this is not in a retirement account no penalties right\nA ... a hundred thousand is just ... right yeah I always say it I mean you're talking about the head and the heart and that just with\nThe mathematics of it ... if you leave ... by me if you put risk in the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and so your\nHeart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount\nAnd so yes I take the money out of their house I'll be ... exactly what I knew\nGuy just Blake confidence senior executive producer of the day Ramsey show this hour

that's an indicator of how they can pay if they're if they're if the your grads are donut budget and let's see you know are we are looking at their income to rent ratio and um you know if if one of these guys what\nIs the guideline for the encounter and what percentage\nWell what we tell folks and after you is to not take out anything more than a fourth of your take home pay right gotcha or how can they survive but more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know maybe their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years\nLane and how I have I have that they're protective pants on that on a low and I have a sixty five hundred dollar per month terrified income and then I have on the high end at twice at twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and um\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah birthday that the lower income just for our security\nYeah I mean I I ... and again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something I got to know what else was in the mix the whole story but all things
