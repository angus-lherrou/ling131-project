with the thirty hundred and put it in its place say you can keep knocking it out\nFor and why is that why because I think the question is very common like okay I'm working on the snowball nuggets of so let's say it's a four hundred dollar medical bill\nYeah well I Do that to go ahead and get it out the way it's still momentum yeah you're still building the idea of okay I can do this and if that

I Would say that's a great first step to uh to come here go through that training Chris Hogan teaches a lot on that and it's phenomenal\nYup just once on Monday you can check that out well I had him on but we have we have fun on the record show super fun and Hogan crafts become Hogan around here is just phenomenal at what he does so\nWe spent the entire episode talking about everyday millionaires so what does it look like to build wealth what a millionaires look like the mists around that the truth around that and it's so great like we even sit and George Campbell our very own one here at the Daily Show out in the streets national they asked people I paid for like for instance your job\nWhat do you think a millionaire when he's at our jobs are and it was like doctors lawyers movie stars right like all the answers but the truth\nIs so different and it's all in the book everyday millionaire so I was just really encouraging like you said everything from their job their salaries these people they are not what you would think are the millionaires but the average Emily millionaire out there in America looks a lot different than what you probably have in your mind and so it's really close to the whole episode yeah we have fun talking about\nDid you how to be a millionaire too because when I was on your show it was huge day at the Hague hang it for ... for for them and bring it shaped\nNose and he bought me money what if the millionaire show me a million dollars in the crowd in this looks for cash but I just want to reach a crucial [laughter] if you pay I'll I'll give you ... to five five to too far but ...\nCheck it out sorry and you'll see when Facebook ... maybe you Amish and your shows going well two\n... one Twenty one to be under the remote virus struggling a tornado plugs back to your calls Tripoli eight to five five two to five triple lady too far five two to five is the number Lauren is up in Atlanta Lauren how can we\nThink that they want to call Cher well my husband and I learned working on ... and ... and really block financially by some family and we don't have any that are paid off all that that we don't know what to do next [laughter]\nLauren you're in a spot where you say that what do you mean you don't know what to do to I understand you're saying but what does it means what what your next goals are that what you're asking\nYeah yeah I mean we don't make a ton of money on a teacher and he's a ... or so yeah our but our family his grandmother really financially\nSound very cool so is this a financial cushion career course you\nKnow finance look like everything in our careers [laughter]\nOchre gray hair you go there you go right to cook I well\nI Would say are baby steps learn if you know is passed every step three which is to say three to six months of expensive than the bank do you guys have that cash available\nYeah okay so you have thirty six months of expensive so that's done so then I Move on the baby steps four or five insects forests are funding retirements whatever you guys make than than you know start going into funding retirement Roth IRA I'm\nA four oh three bees is that whatever if there were ... if your husband's church as a pastor has a retirement plan plug into that but the Fifteen Percent into retirement and then what do you guys have kids [laughter]\nYou do yesterday yes no no no that's all right no cats so then you get baby step five which has kept college it skipped maybe six 'cause it done which means are near um baby step seven right now so that is just building wealth and giving which is a pretty awesome spot to be the what I Would say for you guys is funding that retirement\nBut then also have similar goals that you guys want to me because I'm you know there's there can be this monotonous state that you get in\nWhen you don't have any debt or a house payment none of that and you're just putting money away\nAnd savings and it's just kind of like okay it's just there so you need something exciting that you guys want to do whether that's a vacation you want to take maybe at ... we went to upgrade our home in five years and can we cash flow that can we go next Kobe are upgrade of our house we're going to complete we're never going to go into debt like bless your grandmother's like us and say\nWe're going to know that if we sell our house put money towards that so still have some things are working towards\nBecause that makes the saving money fund versus going just as black hole account and so for you guys to your lifestyle keeping in check like you don't need to go strap against\nMaybe you know you could up at a few a few percentage points each year as your income grows that's totally fine enjoy that because you guys are at that spot I'm but had that savings cold winter and I'm\nYou know we we definitely have a couple now we're like okay what do we want to save towards because again like I said it can kind of be monotonous of just putting money in savings so having those goals for you guys as a couple and as a family is huge and last but not least learn and it's the first thing we always talk about but it's true I guess\nYou're at a position that you have to just a really cool giving because you guys have no payments at all not even help paying that much of anything goes out in a while do really the big things you can do now and vast safe for something in the short term that you guys are looking forward to and ...\nWe know Chris organ talks a lot about this when are you do as well I think the thing they need to do next to go to a very nice dinner\nCandlelight dinner and take a pad of paper and dream all but that remains because essentially what you just laid out was dreaming yet and I think they're in the position to actually really dream\nAnd even about giving and and maybe your homes to what if that's your deal you want to buy land in what happens is now that you're in such a great position you're going to get their way faster than you fought but this is a season to dream\nAnd it and for anyone out there like this is something that couples especially if you're married ... if you're if you're like us which I think your your three kids\nBut it's like every day it feels like your alarm goes off you wake up you drink your coffee you get ready for work and get the kids up to get them out the door and how to work on my roof you come back I mean there are things like I thought you know you get home you get kids going to throw in the bath tub ones running out make it you're trying to get them back in the ... mine are\nLike ... they\nLike it is and you finally get 'em in bed and you're like oh\nWhat had happened like and you can live in that state for you and you never look at a couple of like\nWhat we want to look like in five years and that's the fun part Chris says it and it's true isn't it fun marriage you guys like you get to build your future together so\nLauren her husband need to do that debt free but also if you're in that still have those dream meetings and dream 'cause that's fun to be able to like what are we going to even if it's our dreams to be out of debt and Eighteen months\nDream go for it\nYeah and she can make a very key key point I don't want to drive this home to folks somebody out there don't have a lot of hope and it's because you're not focused on a vision\nSo there's a psychology study up there it's a very well known and uh it's it it shows that the brain what it focuses on we tend to see you notice when we didn't see before and here's an example of the study that most people get when you go buy a car\nYou buy that car lot and you drive it out how many times have you done this and you see it everywhere for the next day so have you noticed though yet totally so that's real that it's a real effect in what's happening is is the brain has been so focused on this new car purchase you wanted if you look forward to it so much then you go buy it and you're so excited about it\nAnd then all of a sudden you never saw before\nBut it's materialize and in front of you it's always been there but you are focused on ... so to your point\nThat applies to this idea of even if you're just just completely covered up and debt right now maybe your baby step one you just got to know Dave and you're you're doing this ...\nIf you can have the meaning that you talked about Rachel what it does is it allows you to see the end of the baby steps and when you can see it and focus on this desire future Fraser use around here all the time yeah\nVenue or brain will begin to see the baby steps and the sacrifices many opportunities to do the long haul stuff to get you there that's the key it's not just this fun romantic dream session it's practical it's what keeps you in the game\nOh absolutely and I said earlier ... said again some fun around here it is literally like okay well we're ... feet you're you guys were you know wherever she said twenty twenty three

plan I'm from I'm I'm I'm a\nRetirement from a job that I had ten years ago and I let the money in their arm is about twenty seven thousand dollars and it's growing at an anti trade of five percent annual and\nI wasn't going to leave it there and to retire to retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years but I did the math and it's only gonna be sixty three thousand dollars out of the time I turn takes he should I take that money out and um\nI I just purchased a house for two Seventy five when an ... loan so the Mali note on that if I Eighteen hundred I take that money out and refinance sock and get on a lower mortgage and then same them different from the market when now I'm no\nNo I Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stock mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money okay like\nNorth of ten percent most of my mutual funds of averaged over twelve percent\nAnd you can pick mutual funds that have done that a by getting with a good investment advisor that it teaches you you have to get someone with the heart of a teacher you don't just do something because they said do it or because somebody in the suits and do it\nWhich you sit down with them you learn how that works and you put it in good mutual funds and do what I R I roll over from that money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart faster\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information that drops down a list of the smart investor prose the people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them\nAnd I'm a shutdown with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this\nGet comfortable with the idea but I think you can make a lot more on this money than you're making all that now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes\nAnd penalties for that matter [noise] em Ali is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow day thanks so much for taking my call sure how can I help\nSo I have a question not as much for myself but for my parents my husband and I were introduced to S P U and\nAbsolutely love it and we are just because that one tenth the and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to ... and it's probably going to take a few years and I guess my parents thinking in this horrible head of the fair\nOn being completely broken overwhelmed and just war thing or have at the end so I just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really like an ice from their kid and even in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still again\nAnd it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout right about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and as I pointed out oh yeah yeah ... but um that you generally doesn't happen and so you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend that's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drinking\nI mean ... ... and I've talked to him people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money is does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were ... mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't\nAnd if you do have to go heavy on somebody a little bit uh just blame it on me go on a day ... you just said Dave said OK and just go you know you can argue with David you argue a day but you know he got so many people out of that I don't think you'd it sure\nSo um you know whatever it may not be that abrasive but you don't want to write but the point is you can go got bad guy they call it off on me and lean on that and so\nLike when ... first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old I mean I'm like her what she thought sure [laughter] now she's twenty eight and had three ... three ... national bestsellers and now a few people cares what's right side of it but she just blamed it on me\nOr if we're in a Christian so I think we blame it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says right [laughter] the Bible says the borrower slave with the lender and you want to argue with that how can I get a cat yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power without first counting the costs less to get halfway up and you know what I mean ... obviously you begin to mock you and say this men began to build and was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up on him I mean\nYou know a ... that kind of stuff now again I'm being kind of sarcastic and bombastic he would be I Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller setting up the bigger the setting the more wild I Am about the uh but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go guys I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers\nBut here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results I suspect if you do the same thing we did\nYou'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles\nRight you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you or training or was four hundred pounds\nAnd he was a forty five years old\nBut he doesn't like you're telling him anything 'cause you're thirty one and you have I have I mean come on [laughter] you know the personal trainer you got out and got abs yeah so I mean he may have he's got to ... or something you know you just you just kind of this is what you're doing ... my point is you have proof but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question wealth okay and that's just a\nA level of humility um but you can be forceful on the principles and on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization or brand or whatever\nAs proof of the principles and\nYour personal life is proof of the principles and if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse but ... and again you don't want to be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be a race right and it's just not your style it's not who you guys are okay but do really you got a great story\nThank you and you just tell your story yes 'cause this is what we did I mean you know what you want it but this is what we did right and and look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds of new Peter they set option donate to smooth this is what happens you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class no thank you how to sew cooling and doing that yeah I'm excited and you know what's what you'll find it interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life or you know that that you you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you\nKnow and they you know they they won't but but that's what you got us or you're who they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty if they'll go do it so great question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for taking the class Haley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nToday I'm I I'm ... I'm from Taiwan\nUh-huh [laughter] so\nAm I have I'm twenty five thousand previous player in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and praying that are not pulling it out by ... fun good guy went corrupt guy in our church he worked for private financial and hip our favorite holiday sales\nAnd and so I can let me every I I Need that in fact well even if I felt that we put money other variable annuity mutual mhm and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay our topic you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach 'em how to answer that part of the question\nVariable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the annuity is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion now would you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the ... wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the ... do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's in an IRA already Dutch so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into it and knew the inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle\nAnd it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees so I'm\nOkay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual fund sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to sell you that's because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can making its way in insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a variable annuity are about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the chicken or guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my guess okay and and here he is he is he still giving you a bad recommendation\nHe did say that I couldn't do that and you're trying to find exactly as you recommend them has using hand feed it really ...\nSo that variable annuity and asked me to go home like all the number at my husband review and think about ... well I wanted to call you immediately and I knew what you are going to say already\nYeah so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by ... that you don't know is bad\nI you're right that can go and I I Try to let them\nKnow that right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes to our church I mean and I find that you know network\nYeah well that's okay I mean it's that you don't have to do business with people at church is not necessary so\nAnd so I I I don't think I'm going to do business with this guy ah because I mean I I mean I I don't like his advice and I might not like it next time I might not understand next time so I just get a smart\nRestaurant row and moving that way series of gross our mutual funds correct to\nThat is thanks for the call that I've Ramsey show [noise]\nLike ... and she

kinda stuff\nReal estate and making good money uh especially paid for real estate it's very very nice I got a bunch of it but if you don't want to do with all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way\nBut the point is there's no shame in your game by keeping it simple\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary is it the truth is the contrary to that the truth is is that the typical person who builds on net worth of up to about ten million dollars on does keep it very very clean and very very simple\nSarah is with us in all uh Seattle, Washington Hi Sarah how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well thank you Kelly for taking my call\n[laughter] we'll we'll let Kelly answer your question if you want now [laughter] what something Sarah [laughter]\nUm I'm trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance\nMy daddy is sixty seven and doesn't qualify for health issues for my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago and a couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nNow for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and my mom says that short term thinking ... and I think they need at the budget\nMuch or how low income\n[noise] um [noise] well that's a good question they are retired missionary so they made a town and my dad is now retired and my mom works at the reception is I don't know exactly what\nThey're not fit in their budget okay\nI mean there may have to buy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he is attempting to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nTell them I Try to do what you said the Potter but her or whatever you know say you know what works for me to fathom mhm really\nHe doesn't get to get in front I get too much into that get fat apparently um like last year I encourage them to look into it and who they talked\nTo ... I think he didn't qualify at that point out\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they gonna do it or not I mean how can I help\nOut my mom called me and told me all day so I think she's on board\nOf trying I guess my question is um\nHow can I ask how to convince them that it's an important [laughter] you know like\nYour mom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they'll get the money to buy much of a policy sounds like a pretty broke too many\nUm with what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes I don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think your ... your mom's question and yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget um but it sounds like his health is he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's er no I'm Sorry about seven years you're saying but I'm\nIn his health is worse and typically Seventy five percent of ladies outlive their husband statistically nationally\nUm and so the one that I'm most concerned about going into nursing home and eating up everything as him and we can't get him covered apparently so uh I don't know what to say other than just try to coach your mom from a farm but there's no magic pill make them do what you want them to do this is the day Ramsey show\nWhy in the world would you trust some Rand\nSure yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand victims took out loans just up as a freaking nightmare\nThat's why the only play on I have for my family and my entire team is through Zander insurance Zander takes over all the work to solve these problems in more along with the system to reduce your risk and protect your money if your accounts get hacked\nVisit Zander dot com recall eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two it's the smartest most affordable way to protect yourself\nWhen\nDo you need to sell your home but don't want all the hassles this is my grass\nAnd this is Terry graph of the ... team and we do things other agents just won't do\nIn today's market your home needs a lot more than a yard sign in an open house you're home needs to stand out\nThat's why we spend tens of thousands of dollars targeting and attracting hundreds of qualified buyers every month\nThat creates demand in our homes and helps themselves faster and for more money than the average agent in central Iowa\nThat's why we can guarantee to sell your home in a hundred and twenty days are real personally by her home for cash of course some restrictions apply we're not bragging were applying for the job of selling your home fasting for top dollar\nCosts today at for nine one zero zero zero zero that's for nine one zero zero zero zero or go to for nine one zero zero zero zero dot com and start packing\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade on the bed we sleep in to the raise that we use when we wake up that we've neglected one of the more impulsive products and dating\nFive times the most iconic brand in the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me ideal now pi times the best\n[noise]\nDot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making busy at high time investor dot com that high time investor dot com\nRenovations presents\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoined suggest renovations Ford cocktails in conversation with Justin Baltimore's jail if you get to see the news limited reserve you today on the jury innovations Facebook page\nSounds holding course offerings will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and shares a kind of ...
