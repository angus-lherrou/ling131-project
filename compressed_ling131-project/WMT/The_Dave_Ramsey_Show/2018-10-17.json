Ryan read it and two days and I said yeah let's go ahead and I'm not a reader [laughter]\nAnd we just got after it and it took us thirty month to pay off that initial fifty five thousand dollars net mhm and then we've built our emergency fund and started getting after our house you know and not really believing we were going to pay off the house\nAnd I'm as quickly as we did but even when life got in the way we just kept sticking to the plan and here we are\nAnd we're just incredibly proud of where we're at\nBut you ought to be well I mean if you have a guard rails you know if you're bumping up against them yeah and on and so I got I got a game plan here where the houses the house and you get knocked out a little bit then you get back up it's the houses the houses the house and enter your ten years later you started when you're twenty eight and every thing is paid for you don't have a single\nPayment how's that for you it while I was just thinking this morning as um I don't when when bill day comes around it so fast because there's nothing to pay for it yeah yeah it's awesome\nBuild day and we were able to uh you know start putting that money towards the future and agreements rather than a choice we man fourteen years ago and that is it's just a huge blessing\nYou got your future standing around your they're called kids your retirement and uh your your wealth building your generosity that's all future now instead of paying country wide way to go you guys very fun who was the mortgage with\nA it was with country I really got a bunch of ... a few different ones along the way they\nBonds are really good for you guys so you said you've led classes financial picture virtually over this ten years so now that you are the coordinator that has paid off their house if people look at you like wow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps at up to a giant stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that the the giving them the ... um what's really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving a church like boys what we're give what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality anymore wearing take away it's we've learned how to live\nSo it makes sense yeah\nSo I mean first thing we got to do is make sure you have enough cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have an up and pay some down the student loans or what\nThat's what I was trying to figure out like you have a foul something between Fifteen and twenty grand between now and then the next fall when I go back to school and I've got knocked on the loan so I didn't know stay well\nFirst thing is when the first thing the first call is complete school be a hundred percent sure way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nWill take about a year and a half\nAnd your degree will be and what\nA good businessman and created\nOkay and I'm\n... move you up in income immediately or are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance means like higher leadership for all that kind of my reasoning for one could go back to school to finish\nMilk or which it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's a good plan but yeah the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you're saying I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all of my school and then you save up thirty thousand\nAnd then you save up\nAnother ten thousand I wouldn't I mean Thirty's more if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad than everything above that you start paying off the dad if you got really really end of the money you see what I'm saying but I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want a little extra to make sure you get through school with no new debt\nThat your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to practice dealt with a vengeance\nAnd that's going to be the process but um\nThat that that's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey Rosen Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey\nHow are you how you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I made a I work for a company that had the we support while I Will be paying if I give to the program I Will be paying one twenty appear to be there to lead a program but\nThey weren't going my car manufacturer yeah where do you work or what do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this was an Employee Benefit for it and it is excellent\nBecause they furnish the car at a cost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... to use a two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car it will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes\n... author you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not they tarnished liked a Tarzan oil and stuff to you sir is gas even furnished and that they are\nI Can't remember no no no there's one on one of the car manufacturers emerged but it's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires low right\nEverything is the insurance and that to ... see that's a deal of a deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nBut that's not a leash that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an Employee Benefit in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits\nAnd they want their employees driving one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile show yeah and\nIf I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up\nTo a certain amount of milk or the one that you liked or whatever yeah okay All right well do it's a deal I mean seriously you know ... you can't afford to buy insurance for that\nGot much less the Tarzan maintenance much less all about the loss and value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay\nYou know and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it 'cause it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for beamer\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it if if I was driving you know if you're driving ten thousand dollar car man\nYou can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWith what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving a ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question my thank you for calling in and um again it was a great deal appreciate your joining us Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most ... thing and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's a it's like most people buying a biscuit okay I couldn't afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and I I'm I'm much been on a boat [laughter]\nBut not all watch so I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but\nUh uh so\nThe boats bigger than ... [laughter] so yeah\nIt just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that\nMy point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that on and watch he's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand watches nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his his generosity dinner as hard as huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I ... I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your you know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars will that just stupid\nThat I can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it is my point\nAnd so and really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people\nJudge other people because they can't emotionally grasped that in just because you can't emotionally grasped something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here and so anyway that's a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff in the legacy journey book only both have ever written about welfare\nAnd other books I've written the money and so that puts this hour that Iran's or show in the books we will be fine with me on the number there's ultimately only one way to financial\nDaily and with the prince of\nPeace and\n\n... sold them here you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire was impossible these days\nOr people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's why our team has already done the hard work for you\nWe've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart just perusing your area\n...

where\nWe you know you ever you ever said something like this when you look back on something falls apart we have a team member that goes off the off the rails they go crazy and we go yeah well you know it kind of felt where\nBefore that you know and you know watch something feels where it's cause it's weird that's why something feels weird and you know yeah ex husband living in the basement qualifies that's under the weird column\nYeah I'm with you and and so you know what I Would do is and what I Do in situations like this is I just lay it on the table and let everybody look at it\nAnd so I'm also it back down with her and her husband for our hurt and I go okay I don't want to be rude and I'm not trying to be tacky or anything but ... is a small business or no we're pretty close together and um and I kinda know because ex husband in the basement that's just weird in most people's minds do you think that's weird\nAnd it's like oh no we think he's awesome than than there where

being right now I'm being funny on the radio okay I Would be kind and gentle when but I'm Still going to put the question on the table and go okay guys and they go yeah it's weird and you know what we've been thinking it's weird and he's moving next month okay cool that is a higher\nNo we think it's good and it's part of our Christian walk to forgive him and give him a place to live no you're strange I'm not hiring you you know\nAnd that's what's coming up in an ... problem problem problem you know and so you can find out about about these people as to how they feel about that now if you don't think it's where they don't think it's weird than you would probably work well together\nBut it I think it's weird and they wouldn't work well here so it's like that's kind of how you look at it and you just\nUsed to call stuff out and go strange that's strange that we're you know my husband and I been separated for sixteen years but we've not managed to get the divorced on why that's weird

I was living Amish what my friends told me and my sister lost her husband and the state within often and so she\nHad two little babies and there was nothing that I can do to help her ...\nAnd I hated that yeah so um I wrote to you and you've sent her to ... oh wow and I think as her family unit neat so um we both got out of it she knew what to new after that and I finished up my debt mhm\nThe problem was once I got out of debt I\nI didn't get into more debt I tell people I fell off the wagon Iran along behind it [laughter]\nWell you go yeah I see what you're saying exactly how she doing she's doing great good how many years ago was that a well her daughter's in college now and they were babies they were babies so it was like Fifteen Twenty years ago or a into\nHim wow wow good so we got married several years after that and I have a long commute to work so I started listening to your ... and sort of began to say to see where I went wrong\nMhm and we watched one of your um about something here and I've got a free download them so we watched it one night I was a little apprehensive about that because my first marriage had some issues in this area mhm\nAnd I at the end of that he looked at me and he said\nHow long would it take ... and\nI fell in love with them all over again [laughter] I Know we gave up everything that ... once an essential and\nFor sixteen whole Mars sixteen homeland but now it's all done I mean ... you guys are an awesome straight yeah it's it's a way better feeling when you're sitting\nThere with a two hundred thousand dollar income paid for property everywhere life is good on your plan to end is very nice very good I mean you're going to you're you're on a trajectory is going to be incredible\nAnd you'll never be in a position again if somebody you love needs help you can help them a new you're there now Amy this is amazing wow well good for you a great story I Love it and I love the cabin pictures flashed up on YouTube or\nGreat you can go there any time you\nKnow what your heart your weight [laughter] well it probably slaves good since it's paid for an ally gets so what do you tell people\nThe key was 'cause there's a lot of heart and your story ... I'm a motion in your throat when you're telling the story\nFor sure it's hard to get it out actually um [noise]\nYou know life is about choices not gave us free will and and which you choose to do what what you want to do and so it's a choice it's we we chose to do this ... and we sometimes chose it more than once a day [laughter]\nBut the key would be to choose it I think you would say the budget you have a plan have a plan and find your content in that yeah\nI watch and what's the what's the car that you need to replace\n[noise] so the the car need that I Will need to replace the combat troops on if it's a good reliable car but I Know that you know actually the miles of getting up there\nFor that you know there are normal normal ... why can't you just save up between now and the time you were placed the car and much longer you can grab the Hyundai for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nLong or dropped a Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years\nTo save up a car price between now and then\nI think I could yes\nOkay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want\nTo know I get the the second quit on a brokerage account most with long term so I think if I sell it it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salad the year that\n\nYou'd like to know that we don't have any basis in that stock\n[noise] say no I don't know why\nYou didn't pay anything do I\nKnow I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in their shoulders there's that ... as far as taxes go it on the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car with a brokerage account because one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to shell and you'll know how to fund your emergency fund and keep the other one ... with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\n... how are you know\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm I just wanted a little bit of help on where to start um I'm looking to start at ... ... like a full time business\nI down the line like you to try to um I had been mean cranky right at the ... and I'm already I'm already got a copy of the book\nYeah I had that I Love that show works ... in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan that had about a few years back\nNow I'm trying to look forward to it on my plan and a sports camp um my question is how do I start\nWhere do I go up my problem in my knee permits for local park um I have ideas of asking alliance\nIn the economy it's only a practice at baseball or Pakistan batch about for like need location it's not just plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nA lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this was a a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal dumping\nOkay I I Would I Do want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nNow I was out there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you're going to get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nI but I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this way and you know you can you start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Know I'm tired in French guy can basically plan that I had that dream right age for the longest time and now that I had a book that can be acquired cats in our age I'm ... right now where how how do\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you\nTake that cash and that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't wanna do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat ah when I started financial peace University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had to book it and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you should have meetings and he'll like a hundred and thirty people as a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables that moved around and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just book it as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening and I looked at another evening and then I was looking in so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\n'cause we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this\nVery well done good good good Lara follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest if you're saving on interest you can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make sure\nThat alone is a fixed rate\nAnd make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and just throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll mix up a four or five or six and a seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign to five wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up ... net net net right\nThe aggregate in other words so make sure that you are getting a better rate or don't refinance and make sure it is a fixed rate but then you got to do a lot of work to get out of deaths the interest rates are never going to get you out of if you had to get really mad that's how you get out of that\nAnd you got to work your tail end off it's how you get out of that is that I ran for showing the
