Cindy how are you\n... how about you and better than I deserve what is what\n... me and my head and currently for baby baby steps\nOne step too and I'm Linda okay we reached only hell of a wedding anniversary yeah he yeah he he went out and particularly if you don't fall when an anniversary a rain and credit\nAnd it without you know and I'm Troy Detroit keeping it or we\nDon't understand how his brain works [laughter]\nI thought you said the two of you are working on a plan to get out of that\nI that we were yeah\nI'm more concerned about the fact that he's not on this plan than I Am the ring\nI agree 'cause of my next week he's going to finance power tools\nYeah and then he's going to come up with a new ... three weeks from now\nWhat have I think a lot more there you go go what's finance that six thousand dollar drawn their lawn mower you might be a redneck give you a payments on you're riding mower you know I mean Syria ... did you see the breakdown breakdown is we can't get out of a whole hour digging out the bottom\nCatch a cold and so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal that I Am whether or not you keep those ring mhm parcel out take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years and you know\nIt'd be nice to have an ice rink and you can get another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nExactly and I mean it's sweet\nBut dumb\nA he'll be twenty eight [laughter]\nOkay um is what is one\nOf the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land [noise] okay I'm In a a in a\nLabor accident gotcha okay leg or arm what leg okay All right\nAnd I'm not to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been so many different disputes back and forth in\nCounter suing going on by lawyers and that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this was coming to a head\nI think it it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nAs well as with twenty million dollars is they're gonna they're gonna mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think honestly he just wants to be working he wants to be back at work he doesn't\nWhat is going to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now he won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your\nBody anyway right as a career path so generally speaking and so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit\nDown and ask themselves that question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world\n[noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money because they won't\nTake as much of that a small percentage of that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's\nFifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he gets to choose that now that's awesome can be a self employed track that could be a a a track of\nUh some kind of a a a\nI don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding okay\nRight [laughter] that's okay that's okay in terms of technology though um he's kind of wanting to start his own business now he's getting all these ideas that have have you know um what are the X. implication is on something like this that you've known to be facing with\nIt depends on how the settlement is structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured in California as well that's correct now\nThat that's the first thing you need to figure out what the taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to have met the second thing then is figure out what we're going to I Would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nI mean if let's say there's twenty million after taxes just use a number okay and if he if he pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you're just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of free money okay so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in ... in the abundance of counsellors there's safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nA needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer he needs a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs and investment person in his corner I'm ... probably you when someone else sitting there that will look at him and telling me stupid\nWhen he was being stupid and he needs to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because yeah white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but the coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing it then that's how I get shy stirred right\nAnd and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board rights but we got a CPA we gotta stay planner we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nI get a ... they get a ten million dollar signing bonuses and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost a million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and guide you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then they and they need to say they need we'll look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments them forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open a twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah [laughter] that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm\nSo don't do that you know don't don't don't open a twenty million dollar business don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business it's very small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time but he's a tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counsellors and the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counsellors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today ... ...\nSo the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn and it'll take ten years for him to intellectually an emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all if he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a tree and a pizza parlors all gone it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much you appreciate all the five\nMaybe that's exactly what we would do if we were in that situation before she had to call and thanks to James child's Kelly Daniels and Blake Thompson I Am Dave Ramsey your host we'll be back with you before you know and in the meantime remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the daily with the prince\nOf these crises [noise]\n...\nHey it's Kelly Daniel ... ...\nDid you notice that some Seventeen Dave Ramsey show listeners paid off ... million dollars in debt that's pretty impressive to you this year listening from orange ... [noise]\nI must say that I'm I'm One of our kids are down ... had a Kenya ... and uh we during that time it's man that went on there\nNow so you had all kinds of expenses that you weren't prepared to cover\n[noise] correct OK okay and how's he doing now\nDoing really well he's in remission and now we're four years out that way are very optimistic\nGood good well that's a tough thing to fight through and congratulations\nWell if you're going to have credit card debt and you're going to make a mess of your finances that's a really good reason to do it okay [laughter] taking care of your baby that's how I that's higher on the list and being a spoiled princess and buying crap you can't afford right [laughter]\nRight right well I mean we had two other kinds of blew out their knees and we had to pay for them and how\nIt turns out kids break and so we need some kids break funds called the emergency fund\nAnd homeless and we make and you haven't been doing that and so when life happen you didn't have any ... when it rang and\nThat's what my rabbit okay so now we know we need an emergency fund and you know we need to cut up these credit cards and clean 'em up the good news is you can pay off thirty four thousand dollars is what you make in one year okay\nWhat you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans and know vacations and you're not going to see the inside of a restaurant like you're working there\nMhm but it's time to get serious you get this mess cleaned up it was a mess is there for a valid reason or not which it is a valid reason obviously we're going to care for our babies right\nBut even the ... the invalid part of the reason was you weren't ready when life happened and we all know life is going to happen so now it's time to get this cleaned up and get your emergency fund them places will pay a price to win let's get rid of it and it doesn't\nGo away by moving it onto a mortgage so I'm going to cut up the credit cards on a list them smallest to

marvel yep yep so well welcome gosh are you hearing your debt free scream I Love it how much you'll be paid off a hundred and eighty thousand to look at you that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years six and a half years and your range of income during that time\nAnd starting out at at Seventy five thousand and ending around the hundred and sixty thousand good\nFor you you guys are killing at what he'll do for a living I'm a licensed clinical social worker a construction project manager for a interstate retailer uh-huh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man they saw what kind of that was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nAnd I like eight thousand with my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful state it lands in from a private Christian university\nExpensive spouses\nOh okay so this you drop some coin and yes All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six and a half years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually um when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nOne of the things that you mentioned in your video\nWas a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you said take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flash the cashing in and talk to them that way so we're at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our department at the time and I'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk if if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up buying them\n[laughter] [laughter] that that that's just it to shatter that\nIs a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really and when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting out their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this pet feeling in her stomach says uh we're just indebted to these ...\nAnd ... and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and um so and so we started the class we now down a budget and did the envelope systems we were really um persistent okay for the ... just really got serious about it on\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really um try to work on maybe step too as\nWe paid by car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time where like where we just at our budget you know a few months ago and so that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't you like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt and our first to know we have two kids so yeah it just makes a lot of kids and your [laughter]\nAt least in some country [laughter]\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the income doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light of been the Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half\nAnd a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan\nUm\nI guess she just told the truth I mean it depends on who you're interviewing with as to what they want to hear on something like that\nBut I I think you just say I'm you know I don't\nDo well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that and that and um it yeah I when I come over here to your organization I Want to be bring I Want to be a game I Want to be bringing you a hundred percent competency\nAnd when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition it indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down not good at this and if that's the truth anyway I just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kind of releases you Eric's with us in Afghanistan and don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today\nYes sir I'm I have a rental property an addition to my primary home that I also rent out um but I was just notified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or the house of\n'em that Kim ... am I kind of threw it out the uh there was an inquiry if someone actually wanted to buy the house and I my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nWhere is the house a sin El Paso Texas where's your home it's in southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity now has run in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got bought it ready to buy rental property I suspect you buy the southern Arizona NATO ... absolutely yeah because you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss a I bought a home there then um I moved I uh 'cause it was it was a good deal together they're down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know I'd sell them but that's all it after the reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nFor the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you could apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that's true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but\nUh dumping I definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show Hi how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do you mean situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me today but we're working through your plans or the baby ... baby step to um hang up that so we only have one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have to pay off is my car\nWhich I just discovered you recently and six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the damn thing and buying a brand new car I Do a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good lord yeah well I'm\nAbout ... less than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total\nLuckily we actually bought that GAP insurance to cover the difference between a\nAwesome when you're out awesome that were that free the\nYeah hey but we only have the one thousand dollar emergency find and I need a car like yesterday gotcha\nAnd so what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty okay and um and you have one car right yes okay what does it\nHit the two thousand ain't no I don't know a GMC Truck has those strikes\nGood good okay they said for all right good [noise]\nWow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time I rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say\nFive thousand dollars a month yeah\nProbably so and then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get your Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it OK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drop it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash okay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or they were thrilled about it but we have a four O. one K. that no\nNo no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you ... it's a debt you borrow money\nIs that borrowing and borrowing casting or if you if\nYou should actually even worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge you a ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes to borrow money at forty five percent interest effectively to bought by a car\nAnd I know yeah I ... I didn't know that those were the face yeah terrible okay horrible [noise] no they\nAre ... and lets you got something ...\nNo not not valuable enough to attract car with\nThen ripped the cheapest thing you can rent or are you you're working on some [noise]\nUh no I'm not you're not and I I stay home with my kids okay I've got three kittens so\nOkay how long can you make it without a car\nI Can't make it a day with that I really can't get my husband and his hours like where he works and me being home with their kids and having to do all of them to and from school so I Can't be without a car I I'm In a rental right now oh\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have it in cash at the time so my father essentially gifted\nMeans so what's your question\nThe question is do I pay back the\nThe the money to my father because I'm paying him that I'm saying and be\nSure you have a second mortgage on your house you're that you're going to stay in the house you're paid off for the ... absolutely and then you can also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will have come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal ... rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down the toilet wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty thousand dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it and in the meantime pay off your second and pay off your first there we go think\nKevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up taking my call\nA two part question I think you know the first part need help on the second part um my dad came to me a couple\nOf years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and want to take\nA or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for them I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premiums before he retired mhm I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance but he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he\nPasses I have money to pay the taxes on uh the inheritance money that will be coming to me and\nSo how long are just as a state\n[noise] uh I Would say it's close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his estate\nSo he doesn't know wasted on taxes I'm no\nYou don't have like ... there's no tax federal there's no federal or state tax on the states over ... ... unless they're over five points for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like so all hit so he's he is I think he's converting most like his raw than it is for only caves and all those things so\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on the\nPhone pay any taxes on me but\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars\nNot see we're okay\nTo have over five million dollars for the feds to get after you so so he he's got you know what he's doing he's parrot back what the idiot whole life agent told him that sold in this\nYou need to keep their costs every state tax planning\nAnd and he's been hearing that since you were born and so he's a betting those same words back out like a parrot and the cage\nOkay but I don't know what he's talking about okay and neither did the whole I got a job for that matter\nBut if the okay I'll just say okay and so as far as like a conversation with him about that because when he gave it to be obviously had some value is worth about eight thousand\nNow down were that he really appreciate you and I appreciate the intent behind this the more I investigated it I think I'm positive that my son angel coaches telling me that I can do a better job\nWith this eight thousand dollars than leaving it in this policy policies not couldn't grew it with my plans so while I Want to honor you and be grateful
