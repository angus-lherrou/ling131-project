{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "I'm we our number one we owe a hundred and seven or eight on what about one sixty five which are in rental property number two um we owe one sixty five and it's worth about Ninety five okay All right\nYou're making a little profit you may get a lot\nNo it's about a thousand a month I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that that's you know at our drought shut and all that your gross that's before you count like and see and major repairs that come up that that's the gross cash flow the difference in the ... the payment so twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy mine is a an occasional heating and air system or a roof occasionally\nYou're you're making a little bit of money that you know yeah fire five ... five grand foreground something like that I'm On a year from like that over ... ... some years will be better than others and that caught on a bunch of rental property shark and trying to do these things in my Dutch\nUm the uh uh in what your household income\n[noise] um and so we bring about a hundred and ten gross\nTo tell you what do you own your home our primary\nUm we just purchased sit on ten months ago and we owe to eighty and it's worth about three hundred\nAnd ... and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so\nSo you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty and that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good rent or should I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion I'm All right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on and says break down and we have about ten thousand dollars a day in and got that on your show you lay out and said oh we have combined probably at twelve thousand 'cause we took a ... we had a lot but we took a bite out of and threw it out\nThere that though we have any help now than ours like\nBaby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't shorten do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them up so I won't let you do your plan okay if you're going to my plan you'd write a check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I was headed to end the call now because you're doing airplane and that\nNo it's just that the end of the year I'm always really tough and might feel you know environment\nSo it was just there in the event that on my condition that don't come through for the next three nights I'm I was afraid liquidated Atlantic I don't think an extreme on being a tough spot so I figure on Christmas that everything goes well then I Would just write the check\nMhm okay ... okay uh uh the\nUh uh you know ... ... you're not\nMaking a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they could flip on your pretty quick\nIf a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate and I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep 'em in the big ones that got more margin in it and more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe three the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so a migraine one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know hardly making anything on that and you're in gash bread on that at all and which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the ... money on the house if you go to three months vacancy if the market shop it up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically okay forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of us and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one the new guys just got a you know it will start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following on Peru in getting the emerging them cheap on done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover ... income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth when you're making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway and that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break so good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five months\nIs with us in San Francisco\nHi Mike how are ya Hi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I just started in October here um and I got my ... that's when I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um\nI got an eight hundred my emergency fund film among baby steps on um the first time I've got a budget and and it's a mess it just seems like I just can't dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay and and they're all going in\nJust seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just dorm it\nYou've been doing it a whole two weeks yeah yeah\nWell that you're you're just takes a little while to get things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're\nWrong but more in there yeah but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I bet people\nGo I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nReally quick I wanted to ask what should I invested in the financial peace university um I should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my thousand just put everything in their first and\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you want to hold on one of them just give it to you and then when I was worried about it\nOh okay All right\nThat that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you're just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAs a top of the page and then every dollar\nOf my ... not every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the page or most been Exxon food and why on utilities and Z own rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any left over money in your budget\nIt is a great out by made it it's definitely the easiest one I've I've done other ones before in the past than this one is definitely the easiest is are the\nHarlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system but it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it yeah you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go oh I'm not forget no soccer pictures now there's one down you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you'll rent or your mortgage payment that's a fix thing we know what that is but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error I get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusts um you'll get it ma'am on all have Kelly ... will get you signed up for financial position [noise]\nThanks to Dr Charles are British or give them more social producer ...

have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed paying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement and that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it\nReally is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\n\nI don't know the debt payment means no credit card bills no student loans no car payments what if you never had to worry about money again I Know sometimes you feel powerless or overwhelm from living paycheck to paycheck but you can take control of your money you just need to arrive plan financial piece universities to step by step guide that teaches you\nWhich are over one hundred thousand\nDollars ...\nFind a way to help them in a room

be be collector in a situation that's how he's pressured his daughter and and with All right you should be\nUm but she's just not interested in and actually not interested in being responsible for it I'm into they kind of old her now into financial piece as well with her work then um but I don't know what the government you\nKnow how she reacting now that she's in the clients\nWell she's reacting from Iraq and like she's she's kind of wanting to take it on\nOkay I'm there she have an income\nNo she doesn't really have an income she's ... actually she does she's working part time um she married no she's not married\nOkay well her first goal is to take a ...\nYear old twenty five okay and why should not working fulltime I don't know her and we agree that she always in video editing and she hasn't been able to keep a job you're out of between a responsibility and it's bad decisions in her life so\nOkay I I'm kind of hearing spoiled brat [laughter]\nAnd mom and dad coached on for a spoiled brat and then they're shocked she she didn't come out and become a a a great a citizen of the United states and pay your bills or are they shocked\n[noise]\nYeah okay All right well I mean you're ended up being a family therapist you might want to send this family to your pastor\nTo sit down and talk through this with them but the bottom line is legally they're both ... and that can play collector all he wants but let me tell you something\nBy collecting you can't collect blood out of Iraq there was no blood there and this girl and getting money you know walk if she didn't work much\nRight now\nSo she's got to take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities first then she pays on a student loan and if she has a one to then what change do take like five jobs and getting gear but that's going to be a shock to hurdles system so she didn't like it used to work and much yeah\nSo I mean that so what we're doing is we're training her to be an adult and um but you you know dad is ... walking around with his chest puffed out like he like he can just yell at somebody and that makes them have money money she broke because she didn't work\nSo I'm Glad they got her in the class so let's get her into let's tell her you need you treat her like she has a hundred thousand dollar student loan debt she's twenty five years old so she does show her answer is you need to get six jobs live on beans and rice rice and beans live on a tight budget take into roommates sell so much stuff that the dog thinks she's next\nAnd you have no life ghetto cause you signed up for a hundred thousand dollars in debt get your budding gear go right that's what you would tell a single girl that was twenty five in your\nClass with a hundred thousand dollars in debt wouldn't you it's good okay then I'll look at mom and dad and they're in my class\nAnd if I if somebody came in my class on a day we signed up because we were stupid way co signed\nFor our daughter who doesn't work much and ah what are we gonna do about this hundred thousand dollars in debt I'm going to go do you just bought yourself a hundred thousand dollars in debt and so I Would put that in your debt snowball and I would get my button gear and pay it off 'cause you're an idiot you coach scientists\n'cause it says in the Bible you're a fool if your co signed for another and you may nicer than that but that's the message\nSo uh you know both I Would put the responsibility on both of them and let one of them start working on the bottom of it and want 'em start working on the top of it mostly where they mate\nDoes if she doesn't pay it they get to if they don't pay it she gets to\nThat is what ... only works are both on the stupid no so I treat them both like individual cases and let them start chewing on the top one of them started June on the bottom let's see who takes the biggest fights and who gets there first there was a middle\nEnglish from ... in the middle on this but I treat

truth I I have a tiny cafe which has paid off I home let them I have and we'll let go and whether or not we should I buy a house that way it would take it on a mortgage and we we want it to you\nKnow I mean it's a personal decision I made a personal decision I don't go into debt\nAnd once I got out I don't think I could go back\nRight and that kind of the you know what we're thinking about um how are you know we definitely that if you know it it actually I'd fan on and we I\nKnow I mean you could benefit with fiber [laughter] but you've been to the new it I mean you know it's it's one of his ... definitely no need you have a house so ah two hundred thousand dollars how much do you make now what's your household income\nAnd I am twenty seven\nOkay and you don't have any debt but your home or you don't have that at all\nBut yeah we don't have any guy because\nNo payments in the world you're making two hundred grand how fast can you save two hundred grand\nA at that point that you know under the ... name [laughter]\nYears fifty grand a year or two hundred and you want to\nBuy a better house currently at the house unless you did this I bet I bet you could do it in a little over two\nHow about you want the house [laughter] well I guess now that in that yeah there you go\nBut bad enough to go in that so this is a this was you know I'm picking on your just to make you think okay All right you know I'm not just picking on your for the fun of it but here here's the thing\nWhat happened was sharing online Jody when we went broke was we should never again never again they'll take a phone call if somebody calls us collecting money\nIt's wrong number\nRight okay and and life is God and there's nothing I Want bad enough to go back into them loose again or the bar where she lived under that's our decision that's how we decided to live\nSo what we teach people the goal is it's kind of like the holy grail that Iran's you show rocket everything paid off so we can become very wealthy and ... and you're making two hundred thousand dollars you you're there now and then you're going to go back into this for a couple of bedrooms I couldn't do it\nIt makes me sad just hearing you talk about doing it but if you do it\nYou know you're just living a different thing so you called me to ask me my opinion what would I Do when I drew once I drew the line and this and I said I never borrow money again no matter what is in if I Want something I have to get really creative about it or I have to really like work hard to save up the money for it\nAnd I have to sacrifice other stuff to get it and then it makes me go I like\nMy lifestyle but I don't know like those two more bedroom so I'm probably not going to cut my lifestyle down to nothing to get this which is kind of what you just said and I show um which is okay that's okay choice you made the choice though but what that does is it allows us to buy something we can't afford\nShow I mean you can do whatever you want to do what you and I'll be friends I'm not really mad at you but you called the Dave Ramsey showing us to borrow money\nAnd it just new you're not ever going to get a yes on that one\nUm show\nAnd just makes me sad that you would go back in ... I Would 'cause I I\nThink you got to stop and measure the freedom that you have the sense of peace that you have the economy turned down to ... for back then if you did that feel\nWhen the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\nShall\nWe just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want it will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth\nAnd great piece and great prosperity and great sustainability and up terms and in down times enjoy to not have a ...\nWar named country wide on my back bank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had any debt just just ... I think I Would probably like ... that it would be bad\nCarl is with us in Pennsylvania had Carl welcome to the ...\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off\nUm there is a hundred and one for her student loan has fifty eight for him are good I have about six thousand for her car um\nSeven thousand for one medical bill four thousand for another medical bell down after another medical bill\nOkay how old is she sixty three why are you know power of attorney\n[noise] she's starting to forget stuff um\nKept getting checked out for dementia ah she's in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying us that I put her on a budget and so now I'm taking care of her stuff what is your income um she makes ... about twenty eight thousand a year\nMhm okay and um what is the house you were hired sorry what's the house worth\nUm my sister lives in it now and she's kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and my own apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\n... can't drill [laughter] she's on a date I Can't for\n\nAre you on the deed on my phone line how did she get on the deed\nUm my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to live so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage\nShe's not any more I was it yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore you know everything everything's in my mom's mom all the utilities everything as\nTake 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off I Can't tell utilities off because we went to kind of your ... and her name [noise] um she has said that she can't because her deposits too high mhm\n'cause she doesn't have to pay her bell so they are ready to deposit too you know compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill right yes okay just to pay the bill that\nAnd that's it and she used to pay the mortgage today yeah okay 'cause I got rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYeah okay so we don't worry about those quit paying the debt quit paying the students that are ... so now I got eleven thousand dollars in the medical bills\nThat does the rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia most twenty eight thousand dollars a year she sixty three years old you're living in an apartment\nWe have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation did you say it was a car and here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I say no you're the power when you're already yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollar car 'cause fifty eight hundred dollars is\nA lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right now I Can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the problem she forgot how to get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes\nBefore she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee from Wisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alert or whatever they call\nThem right yeah yeah no I think\nWe're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do\nYour job has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care\nIt's very hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this\nWe're doing is out of greed for yourself OK so all the student loan people they get ... up nothing nada okay tell your sister she gets nothing not a zip sell the car now I'm Down\nTo just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in her security okay\nI'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there

from mature twins over two tours around\n[noise] yeah [noise] there's not much of a move\nI Know it's not but it does have a lot more upgrade than what our house has now because if we stayed with the we would have to invest money into the house to do the upgrade or um or we could move and that was upgrades have already been accomplished\nMhm or you could stay up as a grudge or we can stay in the way not do the courage or we could stay\nAnd not have got upgrades in it and save money and\nMove with cash right\nThere's no way I wouldn't go work in a I mean you've gone out in the first thing to do is go get house fever\nRight and that's after hearing that ... that that stream that you just had on I thought I but I Know they are already\nYou know I mean you knew what you want to do I I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible it's a tiny little mortgages you said but All right I'll just I just couldn't go back\nOnce this hard to get out I mean you you have a two hundred and twenty thousand are paid for home in Roanoke, Virginia that is not a ...\nThat's right White House as a matter of fact\nI'm well above average square footage and you know stage in a great neighborhood by definition in the ... market that's what's up man also so I I couldn't do it um if you want to do it you can do it um but I certainly can't tell you what I what Sharon and I would do\nWhat we worked our butts off to get out of debt there's nothing will get us back in\nIs nothing I Want bad enough to go back in ... and there's a lot of stuff I like to do a lot of things I'd like to accomplish some of the money to do but I'm not going to death for\nEven for a minute even for just a second 'cause my life is so good without any pretty much so you do what you want to do but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just make me throw up to think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I say either you know piecemeal out of your income\nYou don't have any payments usually rupture money picks up the Algerian as you should do some upgrades or if you want them to ... you know so it's hard for a couple of years you'd probably say buck fifty grand two years without any payments or if you watch what you're doing\nUm but it doesn't mean means you don't get the house that you found while you were out in ... riding around on a Sunday afternoon saw\nThis particular property while that one's not gonna be there oh well there's a house on every corner you do what you want to do um I got mad at you either way I just couldn't do it there's no way ... is with us and Canada Ariana how are you\nI think two days for taking my call and thank you so much for your ministry\nThank you how can I help\n[laughter] I'm a long distance landlord by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sisters was my tenant by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place so it's currently sitting empty the entire complex that its and has gone down in value from my unit is worth Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm so therefore the units of the same style and land is mine and my husband Louis\nPriced at ... like a thousand dollars good\nAh yesterday a\nSimilarly and it came on the market five thousand less than me so one hundred Ninety five thousand I'm starting to feel a bit of urgency to sell because it's sitting empty and winter is coming you know I was thinking of dropping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out also pays six months worth of condo fees ... doing all\nThis with me that I Would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket um\nAfter the mortgage is discharge so my\nSo how would you how much we can't pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies around ... ... obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in higher I don't I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping overall and uh you know that's going to give me my urgency um\nI don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I Want to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there is already five I'm On the market [noise] I've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um oh what a drop in another fifty thousand no I wouldn't [laughter]\nYou know so you know so at some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's so uh but the but five thousand out of pocket to be done with those two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I Do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case academy and when the pay is not a place to live in the winter time well but I mean not only\nJust this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worth three hundred thousand two years from now exactly\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's ... it's time to get out of town you know in a yeah I'm with you I I think you're right I I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now if you start telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand I'm probably going to wait the winter out you know\nThey put a tenet and wait on spring and see what happens but there are some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm Sorry you're facing this open the
