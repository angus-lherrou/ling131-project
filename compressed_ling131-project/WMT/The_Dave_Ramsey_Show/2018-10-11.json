fifty and uh we need sixty so you need to ... thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent of what you're doing okay ah well we're going put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\nCargo K [laughter] so now you have an allergy phony what ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on my couch okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\n... so you're building out two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty\nAnd you don't have to ... percent down anymore okay you see how that works\nYou're giving actor auction loan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether tricked Churchill mortgage I could probably help you with that and you're going to walk in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage literature ticking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to ... ... mortgage a it is taking up and I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walking origin\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would love to improve but we are in a rising interest rate environment\nNot on the panic about but it is going up and so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible way you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rage come back down dramatically um you know in ... in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the day you can get this done Barbara is one of those barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from a and gotten to that too good and I know you're very exciting I don't want to live that momentum that we've had it\nReally toward mhm and and going into baby step three there's like a few curve balls I guess\nOn that are happening so we want to get the three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school can get a bachelor's they get a better paying job\nThat would be a baby step three\nOkay but that's my question but we also want to start a family but we need competitors like baby fine because we want to catch that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it for granted\nOkay the bell that emergency fund for\nMerchants who fired first for you do anything and then you start during other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got insurance without health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund and blood and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me you'll work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nNo matter how that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much okay yeah\nSo you can just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you can just say well run our favorite for that and and and you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to goes on emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes it maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you're right about that and they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nAll right thanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two

of your ... how much how can we afford what our income ... the contract that we've been talking the recommended at us alone and you're not a fan of that\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do yesterday I don't\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou know it really trapped in these things and uh they're nasty bad no I never went to a U.S the long I have to have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now staying wife laugh as far as how much how she can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is into the formula right and then the loan amount\nOn a Fifteen year fixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan is no more the payment is no more than a force of your take on pay\nAnd and that puts you right

... three hundred and fifty thousand [laughter] and I'm Wondering if\nI should use money after tax stock account savings account um sex acts of my emergency account to paid us off or Chuck Chuck's on it at a at a time I have I have the money I guess I'm just having trouble\nOr do you have about ... what are you having trouble with the whole you know time value of money just you know put me to do with what I can make you know what's your what's your house actually we're probably about six hundred thousand\nBased on your concern about time value of money why do you not oh six hundred thousand on it\nI'm chunk Dexter on it why yeah\nThat's right that's that's um contrary to your ... your money problem here since consistent okay so here's what's going on right you you have um some good information but it's incomplete 'em\nAnd show that in that cause you'll be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that All right 'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I Know where your brain is [laughter] yeah okay so because you obviously have a good intellect on especially with the natural things so\nYour your concern is if I can borrow money at three or four or five percent and I can reinvest isn't good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and my not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I you know lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at than when I started looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender and there's no good mentions of debt and scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just used\nTen percent over four percent ... percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a growth in income mutual fund apples to apples with an aggressive growth stock mutual fund the rest of gross stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent\nBut the risk ratio is completely different risk profile and those two phones is completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but basically you can say because one is more risky than the other way mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis that\nSays Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I don't know where is risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now is not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nAnd so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on a home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWell how I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nMore people buy poor people buy lottery tickets or governmental brushing their giving false hope and you're on somebody's going to win will no you're not going to win stupid you're just going to be poor but you bought the ticket you know it's a tax on poor people and people that can't do math\nThat's what it is stupid\n... it is never entertaining to lose money unless you're sick\nI mean you think it's entertaining to lose money I was an entertaining if you do that just throw hundred dollar bills out your car window on the way to work to be entertaining C'mon watched the rearview mirror and see what happens to be back there I mean you know something the younger people graphic be entertaining right [laughter] so you know seriously\nNow so there are things that happen to people that caused them to be in poverty and we're not mad at anybody in poverty but they only variables you can control out of the three possible reasons someone's in poverty you're born into it\nYou are oppressed by

control what other people do you can't control what you were born into\n... spoke to was a while back in leadership prevent wet or on her leadership summit and she was talking about growing up in a

couple of strikes right there right now but she said mom and dad told me they didn't tell me about the victim they taught me it doesn't matter where you're from it matters where you're going\nOh\nNo matter where you're from matters where you're going and so I don't know where you started most of us didn't\nStart with a silver spoon\nOr your privilege okay I'll take your privilege whatever privileges I don't know what you privileges but you know I've never known anybody that had privileged and made their life perfectly easy and with no obstacles\nThere ain't that much privilege out there yeah some people start further ahead than others I get that but I Can't control that I can only control my response you can only control your response and it's your decision it doesn't matter

for ... yes I Am Lovett much will be paid off I paid off sixty thousand or how long the district\nIt took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time I started out at fifty thousand and then I'm In the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to sell for a living\nI'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch a second job\nSo I kind of just a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the stores rubble targeting can get in trouble yeah target gets me in trouble\n[laughter] oh buck I'm a drawl yeah wild or what kind of that was the sixty thousand was all student loans or what your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree\nIn accounting degree to which obviously structure reshape ... yes some actual actual excellent show up at three years ago and when you go to our school\nYes so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that final number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year's salary and so I saw that and I saw my monthly payments and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take poker show original both register for him\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey show when I was like in junior high and high school age\nAnd your mind that will kind of um\nSo my dad is a farmer in Kansas fan in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio and I I didn't even have a cell phone back then and so um you know I Would listen to ask him radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listening to talk radio so um you know I listen to us in in the morning and then I switched to the Dave Ramsey show from one to four nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to us and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange move version though combine yes that's how your tuning in the rodeos you're out here ah getting getting some a picture of it yesterday was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer and also yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work to feel young girl that combined by yourself I Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen million something like that yeah and I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so\nYeah you learn how to work you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes you are not a drop early [laughter] very cool ... this was drilled in your head become over counting you get the degree you look up the road so maybe ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage then um and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency fund in place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me it made the terrible situation that I was in um so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and how that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store called ... I had no remote exactly good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in\nThe world told her I'm twenty eight twenty eight another one of these rockstar millennials are all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff yes\nI did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey but yes I've everyone kind of been in on the loop job who is your biggest cheerleader I'm probably my sisters\nYeah we absolutely ended up paying everything whenever the divorced but he was making about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year and a wide\nAs you know like that now\nWhen we went through the flight and two thousand and one\nAnd we ate lost his job I lost my job um and so he's gotten back he worked in the plant it gotten back to working at like he had to go with a different company and they offered him five dollars an hour ...\nOne or the other company never reopened right and what does he do\nHe works um he's a traitor and the plant here in Louisiana okay Mm don't work in a ...\nHour partly other part of the story I Want to get straight in my head it sounded like you didn't know how much did he had until after you were engaged\nYeah why I I was not aware I was not very smart and I did not come about that I've never had that it didn't cross my mind was should across is\nThat you should have had this information prior to I'm making a commitment to marriage\nYes that's kind of a problem like he was hiding it oh and that bothers me more than the debt right this moment um and so what's his attitude about the debt\nUm he really hasn't been paying ... thanks for that and I just don't want to start a marriage now that I Know about that that I can accept that I guess before we actually set a date to get married I Want to know that we're on a plan to get paid off\nThere you go and that he believes in that plan and is committed fully to that plan I mean the lawn if he is for whatever reason\nHas has given up hope and it feels like he's stuck you're just going to stay there or he just doesn't care or whatever about the debt if for whatever reason he's just gonna Waller when this that's a deal breaker\nOkay it's not the bet\nWouldn't tell you the not marry him over the debt but I Will tell you the ...\nMary andme over lying about it or not marry him over uh the fact that he wants to just stay in it because you're not going to be you know you you it's a long life will help for you\nOkay if you think about ten years Fifteen Years from now you're still wall and the stuff you're not going to be okay with that\nYeah absolutely yeah\nAnd so as long you know and if he's not going to be all and like we live on nothing and I'm you know he probably go back to court and adjust some stuff\nUm\nAnd I don't think he I was forty five thousand dollars on the ... I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they report it you\nKnow I'll go out and he outlined ... Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving and like I think it absolutely outraged ...\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get the\n... and so the the forty five thousand is the difference I've got that settled out for pennies on the dollar really probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] wow a you might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your incomes up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and make more money to do that you have to both have\nThis thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years so um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not to get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nJust what you're going to get divorced I mean that is is a fairly simple equation here\nAnd so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not keeper I don't know if he's a keeper or not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers and all that but as he got his way up\nBut um anyway [noise] man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] laugh out of four that's a good gosh so uh wow yeah\nSomebody so anyway yeah ... this was not an equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was ... wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that's behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go gay mountain that's fine thanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good

yes mortgages are only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund events of the question is uh still about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we [noise] we commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep\nKeep doing the uh paying down the the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing that are in one too\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to home run all real estate I
