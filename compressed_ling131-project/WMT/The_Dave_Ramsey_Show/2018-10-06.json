I had a steep happened I was able to kick it to the curb because he said after the free initial consultation you know what Doug I think you're going to benefit from this and boy have I ever it's an oral appliance I put it in every night\nBefore I go to sleep and it helps reduce or eliminate my snoring in addition to that it's easy to clean as well they accept insurance Dr ... office Medicare

night three three seven twenty five Ninety nine that's three three seven twenty five\nBut again it's actually exactly okay tell me why fat guy a fulltime job because I was like a flaw or restaurant jobs like anybody that actually passed over the payments to me and I said okay without getting myself and can't help\nPayment literally get included and paying payments Oh nice okay right so the story sucks [laughter]\nSo I'm now ... years later a at slash ear see I got my job and she gave me the payments and I realize that even though I don't just now starting off\nIn the corporate world I don't make enough I have to pay for the car so I Know I kind of like a lady that called the NFL I Know you're guideline that I have to get rid of the car but I don't know how to go about doing that that I get my leg you know it's not our off so thick yeah and it also takes so\nShe mentally ill and they don't act like is she mentally unable to make legal decisions\nNo she's not mentally ... she's he's mentally able she has\nA higher standard if their credit so that's why he was able to get the car and get painted actually did\nShow here's the thing she tried to do a nice thing for you and she did it in a really stupid way and so now you're both stuck right because you she ... she owes more\nIt's not gonna hurt your credit at all your ... it's her credit that we're worried about we want to do a nice thing for her 'cause she's sick and not able to deal with this so uh what she probably knows more on this car than it is worth I'm guessing\nIf they can't afford it out I think Kelley Blue book steady was a word around hosted twenty thousand it sent me on the left\nIt's worth close to twenty thousand would have voted against it\nI Want to throw like ... like twenty thousand now okay or does your ... to have any money or she retired but not really so she couldn't afford it okay All right well\nI'm sure you guys are in a pinch us is very uncomfortable because here's what needs to happen she needs to sell this car because her niece can't pay the payments and when she sells the car she's going to lose seven thousand dollars on it what are we going to do with that\nDo you feel obligated to pay that\nYou're not legally are way I\nDon't think you know what I Do get because I said it I Know yeah I'm at fault for not\nVery you know how old are you a choice at it what do you make a choice they have yeah\nJeeze [noise]\nOkay well someone's going to find the seven thousand dollars to put with the twenty thousand dollars that you get from your that she gets from her buyer to pay the car off so that the buyer can get the title and that's going to leave you and her\n... is going to leave her seven thousand dollars and the whole if you want to help with that you can um and we're I'm mediating this I Would say you both did something stupid and I would ask you to split it\n... that she each thirty five hundred and you eat thirty five hundred and let's get the car so if she's too sick to handle the transaction have her sign a power of attorney over to you for the this title\nAnd then you get the car sold and um I have her come up with three thousand five hundred and you go borrow three thousand five hundred and that's your penalty for being engaged in this on her penalty for being engaged in this because the other option as you stop paying the payments and she gets ...\nWhere it doesn't sound really scared of the credit yeah that does\nThat doesn't sound like a good plan to make because she's going to end the sick old lady's gonna get sued for trying to do something nice but she did it in a stupid way so I think ... that she was the fairness thing it's not a legal thing [noise]\nBut it's what I call stupid to actually do something stupid and it costs me

with us in Phoenix Hi Joe how are you [noise]\nDave thanks for taking my call and I'm listening to you for a while\n[laughter] I I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had family his wife had died and he had three small boys to do to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that you shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title loans on her car a road rubber checks as credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got\nQuite a few collection agencies after her she can't be clear with me right now about how much she really knows I don't know I Believe I think it's over forty thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of death last year\nShe is almost thirty four she will be next month [noise] my my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her death [noise] um what does she said these collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nTo nine year old is she still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight here in Arizona gave myself and my husband uh the responsibility of taking care of the baby now and go wherever Sean ... baby stays with me\nOkay so ... moved in with you yeah she's living with me the ... the baby on the mother correct\nOkay good good that's good news okay so here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing and she's dealing with bipolar and you know you date she is what we in the business called judgment proof\nOh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants [laughter] that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking you know she wasn't you know her boyfriend has said to me well I didn't make Lee and find anything that she wasn't aware of but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that in the second book let's assume that debt is valid for\nUs it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her to work our way through it when she gets back on her feet\nShe might even got a job right now I Know I Know yeah\nI Know what I said when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally working\nYeah we're going to let her let her um probably reap the rewards of her stupid in us in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we work with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes\nAlong with offer him in the past year and I realized he or she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant armies mad because she's on two different mints every day so she's been off it from the bottom\nLine is random line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a bi\nEver has you know but it can happen it can I\nAddress on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nYour term insurance cheaper ... alive companies don't sell cheap term insurance\nRight guy I contacted Vander ... last week\nWhen you get your term insurance in place you can just cancel with the company directly if you want to call the agent you can call them I don't care but you know their job is to save the say you'll lose your job is to run in and rescue you from yourself\nAnd so there's no reason to have the insurance review doesn't serve any ...\nI wasn't going to have it I was just going to a hundred grand can't no matter what you know but I didn't know if there are certain steps now that if I did take I Would leave out on getting them the most out of the cash value whatever's there\nNo there's no difference at all all you do is you just call them and get a caller eight hundred number or whatever the name of the company isn't get customer care on the line customer service on the line and you know asked them if there's something they need you to sign or if there's anything we needed X to expedite this but we need you\nQuickly to get me my cash value what's the fastest way I can do that but no you really can't pass it up the only thing that can happen is is they may try to slow Walker ignore your request and you may have to push on them it's kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with them to get it done\nBut no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've been on a plane up and down probably seven months ago on playing on a really challenging time because we have a childhood in college that can you hear that we need to pay for and that's how I have Harry Carey expect there's where I have to take care of getting expensive that they can hide it and not for\nMe to try to figure out in the\nHat and before that you have to be fair game pounce on or taking out a scandal while I'm Sorry that I get something to make sure that we're doing the right thing since I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to work it was really pretty devastating to watch that just fine\nI'm Sorry you did the ... the century you lost your job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into debt\n\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so ... you're in the middle of the storm we got a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\nOn coming out going total we're going to have to pay twenty three by coming out here I'd have to pay about eight thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way there okay\nWell I mean even if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand and the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job and body is eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\nIf\nYou have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband made about Seventy okay and what did you use to do\n'em in software for it and how long have you been laid off\nAbout ... wow not but in Berlin solving a lot of work yeah definitely I didn't really liking it on our arms around something in that period of time in that field that makes two of us working on it working on it okay 'cause I I\nKnow in other words the good news is you're in a an active technology type position\nThat ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not at your inactive market metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester or time to get a job pays eight thousand\nOne of the two but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income and that's what you push through but I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money\nI don't teach people to borrow money at them borrow money to emergencies don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid and greed and fear or a good way to lose your butt with money for sure so don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind than her taking my call sure when my son and I are brand new ... in August fifteenth kind of northern California and in our new we I had a job in coming here as a para educator and kind of a school district has been good not\nAnd so our goal at the cash and we had to\nHave that and and ... and that got into anyway anyway ... along with ... eternity we now have like hey why don't we get a loan against it about four years ago and\nHad eight thousand dollars you're meaning which he retired and say they're giving him the kind of make campaign that has to be married dollar and the next here and it's paying off a ... dollar\nHe retired from there\nWell he lack a company now all day long hearing accurate twenty eight year if if the wine and could they lifted him that during hiring\nNow that doesn't matter on this you're you're a four O. one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nHad to cut back on and say hey get remainder that he can continue to maintain\nA hundred dollars and they don't ... I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so\n... I don't have anybody that happened after that well it's called we call it that far when Kay people\nYou know you need to call attacks professional not the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are\nTaxed and penalized and that's my understanding of the real okay so\nWhat I Would have gotten their games like that right now and when we left we weren't going to be able to pay it back to that point we thought Ryan based on what they call that we weren't going to take that penalty and or the taxes on it wow and when we ain't got\nSettled in Kansas a letter saying that they will say categorized\nIn a very tired I don't care because they don't get to

the last long as you know with\nCash and your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else just paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start buildings from World but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to after you pay\nAll the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get the property management usually take half of it to manage it and that coverage you know made service and that kinda stuff and then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a high season where the ski house or your house and the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you're you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't torn up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there's a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleep and in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's a way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff or not it wasn't a frat party in there it was you know babies and\n... and that kind of stuff in there so running like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broke English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\n\nAnd we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place are broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like house we don't rent it out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um\nSo it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the\nAbout and where it's headed and what it looks like when it's completed in other words it no longer needs to evolve it has a realized it's destiny so in a way um\nThe the tower oh here's a ... a credible opportunity to recalibrate I'm sure that we're now in line with the deep deep blueprints of what it means to be a human being\nIs it a predictor\nAre good question you know that's that's a that's a a a controversial question I don't think show my myself um I I think it's more a reflector um but ... there is you can predict some things\nBut one of the problems with prediction from where I come from is um [noise] see I don't I don't believe that uh the future exists [laughter] um\nI you know I'm a mother and the president right power now guy yeah\nRight and it's it's all happening now it's all here interesting take\nYeah the future is a is a construct and show 'em when we talk about prediction we're looking at possibilities that are happening\nOr in the present moment\nSo and that way if projects\nWhen we talked about the card I learn from you since that doesn't necessarily mean one is going to die\nI beg to differ I beg to\nDiffer you you think now means someone's going to die absolutely absolutely because you know like I always thought it was maybe death of a relationship that could be that\nToo but you know what George everybody's going to die yes sooner or later everybody's going to die so of course it means someone's going to die it doesn't say when [laughter]\nSo I remember you once asked me a art you said or if I get the death card does that mean I'm going to die and I said absolutely yeah [laughter]\nAnd then you will lab rated but we don't know [laughter]\nYeah that's been but that's true with all the cards in the ...\nWell why would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a great question and and my answer is\nBecause um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is our number right\nRight so I'm In in in keeping with say the Tibetan book or the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of dash\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind\nAnd so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of 'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's

fire were ways away from having to worry about this so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file a garnishment at that job and find out you had that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in it might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you been through would clean give you a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but today you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through is you feel the tyranny\nThe tyrant in your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a very suddenly very quickly\nAnd out of almost ... out of almost a desperation an emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail\nCorrect okay\nAnd so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because of the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your drowning or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars and\n... good and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI

debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars if that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars and the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to see in your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for four grand in it\nBut all just gone away without a bankruptcy to see the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again right starts at all new\nBut if you can just clear these things up like drop off into the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy by garnishment\nBut to day I Would not file based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're
