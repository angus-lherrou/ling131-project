I mean the one point five included to pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy in order to reduce the other ...\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we owe about a hundred and twenty less than that\nOkay and that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay sure so the a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing those right was done with all of these two properties oh yeah okay oh yeah wow\nYeah All right at all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge to an advisory or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and now and mark got me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things and brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and me wasn't that way on one of\nThose that I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha or a heart beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force\nAnyone which really only not wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get ... and and what do we want to show than and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nFound it on Monday good at going back to the fact that it's premium off but it doesn't cost me anything and I'm I have to pay you know I'm Sorry\nIt has the cash value in it right\nDown to three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums\nAre right\nNow that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nDirectly I saw it was also they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking it ended up getting\nYou know it's hot sorry is my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight which I like to know the candidate out policy that rates are low\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens to those results in dollars they're going to keep it now\nI got to keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles Hey Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous they thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife my bottom on about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include the property taxes all minorities association and be insurance as part of it came in to the thing I Do all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include\nThe H o lay the property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house\nPour okay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started your class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago an even numbered life we ... we actually get a thirty year long but at the council twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than that pay off and then we are looking actually refinanced into a Fifteen year long one day\nYou can ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's so Fifteen and it will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other than that but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand\nDollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know\nThe whole the whole point is big numbers here not the new show and not splitting hairs on it the er and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be house for that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not find two numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in\nJackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie\nHow are you good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off for like ... I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that's including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house for to save up and buy and so at least save up for the galley or if it would be more ideal pet save that\nContinued until you can tell you ... ... every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I now I Want to ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house\nNo add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based\nIn one day when I have a house that you're living in worse um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd you do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just enough to add on an extra brown jak 'cause I work with children and the guy that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over cell for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street has pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part is I'm\nGoing as somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to\nBe on your street right but you wouldn't want you wouldn't come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house right okay\nSo don't put more than twenty into it just Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition\nAnd what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYou know and your mortgage in all your debt is only twenty five thousand right right yeah and where you are and how much of that as mortgage and how much of this other debt\nA there is only three thousand in the day and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nOkay and you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead free and have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't do math myself by and I know that we plan on eliminating the access that within the next night yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying a falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between the lowest like\nComing into the injury so my eggs if it takes two years from today for you to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you paid cash for the addition is that okay\nWell I mean that's where I'm kind of ... I just I Want to do with that\nNow that's under such a simple question if it takes two years from today and you are dead for it's not a trick question is it okay with you if we if you have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay\nPlan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I live\nGood parenting you can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid\nOff everything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do all of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become debt free and then I Would save up and add on to my house so more than twenty thousand make sure you get contractor beds and\nI'd everything down to you know what you're getting into this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books we will be back with you before you know in in\nThe meantime remember there's really only one way or the financial peace and that's the daily with\nPrincipal these crises\nAnd\nSay it's Kelly and we have that came with a ... at the force of cash to be here thank you for\nHelping

doing shows\nWhere they will do I live here in Nashville I'm originally from Kansas though will welcome thank you and you're here to do that for ... yes I Am love it I'm not sure we fight off I paid off sixty thousand or how long did this start it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then I'm In the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to sell what do you do for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA goal which sucking drop [noise]\nSo I kind of just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the story of rubble targeting can get in trouble yeah target gets\nMe trouble oh buck I Would draw the wrong or what kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what's your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree\nIn accounting degree which obviously shut your reshape ... yes excellent excellent excellent so whatever three years ago when you go to school\nYet so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that final number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year salary and so I saw that and I sold my monthly payment and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly now and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take poker show or journal both register for him\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey show when I was like in junior high and high school age and\nYou know will kind\nOf um so my dad is a farmer in Kansas fan in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio and I I didn't even have a cell phone back then and so um you know I Would listen to ask him radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listen to talk radio so um you know I listen to us in in the morning and then I switched to the day Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to us and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange new version though combine yes yup tuning in the rodeos you're out here ah getting getting some a picture of it I don't know what was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer so yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the feel\nYoung 'cause you're a drawback combine by yourself\nI probably say like twelve or Thirteen million something like that yeah and I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so\nYeah you learn how to work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes you are not a drop are like very cool All right so you this was drilled in your head become accounting you get the degree you look up go Oh yes oh maybe ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage then um and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency fund in place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made this terrible situation that I was in um so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store I go to remote exactly good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world old are you I'm twenty eight\nTwenty another one of these rockstar millennials on all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nYes I did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yes I've everyone kind
