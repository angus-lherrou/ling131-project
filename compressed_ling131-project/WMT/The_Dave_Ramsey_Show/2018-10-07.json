cash and renting about when you're not there [noise]\nNothing wrong with the last as long as you know cash\nAnd your debt free everything about that when your homes paid for everything else was paid for a vacation home is a wonderful extra as you start building somewhere else but basically what is it it's a very large toy\nVery expensive toy that goes up in value hopefully and if you rent it it might make you some money\nMy family not me my family the rest of them most of the rest of them including the grandkids just spent a week down at um\nWas Rosemary beach Rosemary beach the other day and I rented a house on the beach really nice big expensive multi million dollar house for the week and obviously some people on that and rented out by the week\nI'm here's the thing about resort rentals vacation home rentals um you're going to make some money on it but you're not gonna ... you're going to make usually enough to\nAfter you pay all the fees for the maid service and the you know resort rentals aren't like a traditional rental where you know for ten percent or something you can get to a property manager I usually take half of it to manage it and that covers you know made service and that kind of stuff\nAnd then there's a whole bunch of the time it's not rented\nAnd so while you do get a great rate per week during a high season with a ski house or your house in the mountains for ... for snow skiing or a beach house or something along those lines you you're not going to get rich on rent it out\nYou really not I mean it's not gonna it's not really a great investment property it's more of a way to offset some of your annual costs of your toy\nIf you look at it that way you won't be disappointed but if you actually run the numbers out you're not going to be thrilled with it as an investment you're better off to just buy investment property it'll make you more money for the ... per dollar invest it\nAnd it's not as volatile and you don't come in and you know rent or something you know vacation runners haven't come up your stuff or spilled want on your carpet or whatever\nAnd I know that there's a deposit and I know this stuff gets fixed but I also know people are living in their sleeping in your bed\nAnd you just have to think about that you know and\nYou know it's just it's the way it is an even a nice home and even nice people like the Ramsey staying in your home we weren't we didn't tear up stuff we're not like he wasn't a frat party in there and it was you know babies and\nGrandma ... and that kind of stuff in there so we want anything like that but you know stuff I I don't think we broken English stuff gets broken and you just got to know that and for for some people\n\nAnd we put it this way for Sharron Ramsey to walk into the place where she wants to go on her second home as a vacation and someone else to have been in there and some of the stuff is out of place or broken or dirty it would kind of take a lot of the joy out of it for vacating there for her\nAnd so you have to think about that that's a price you pay to rent it out\nAnd all of that to say it's not an ideal investment property it's more like a way to cover some of the cost of your way if you want to rent it out we've got a uh like house we don't rented out we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value
