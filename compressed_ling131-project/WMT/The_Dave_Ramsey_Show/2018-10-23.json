I'm not saying you I'm not saying you're bad for doing it I'm just saying we couldn't do what you're doing\nFor very long it'd be for a very short window out of sheer breaking desperation and then we would go get some kind of little rental and have our own little life until we could save up a down payment but you know maybe you can do that maybe you can hang out there that long but if your debt free today and you land a job tomorrow what do you think you're going to be making\n[laughter] well I'm I'm open in somewhere in the fifty to sixty arrange\nOkay so that puts you at a hundred out young household income you don't have any rent if you're living with them and you don't have any debt because I just paid it off\nAnd then you need to save up you know Fifteen thousand bucks or so for an emergency fine and start saving for your down payment and then just run that map out how quick can you do that and then ask yourself do we want to rent a year\nAnd slowed down are buying maybe by one year which is not the end of the world\nIt's not you know it's not like we're renting the rest of our life but just in order to have the dignity of having your own space for your kids and and the conflict that I mean very few people can live within laws an extended period of time and it not create in not create relationship strain\nAnd it it hasn't been bad living with I mean when we get along

I wanted to thank you very much right now and uh yeah but so I'm probably going to land on a rental for a little while and your situation but again I'm not saying you have to do that but if you're asking me what to do with a naturally\nFor sure I'm writing a check today and I'm debt free for sure I'm starting to build an emergency fund and quickly as I Do that I'm for sure going to start saving a down payment\nAnd um and even if you bought and didn't save the ... because you didn't have a full twenty percent that's okay with me to as long as you're on a Fifteen year fixed and the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay and your debt free with your emergency fun when you move in after you make your down payment and you're going to the house will be a blessing that\nBut if

worse\nProbably about twenty to forty somewhere they're\nExcellent like that so the two sixty one was house and other stuff then\nYeah back in two thousand I think we started around then and uh you know we had had a car loan and credit card debt Carlo and I'm like thirty granted about like fourteen thousand in credit card debt and we paid all that off and then over the last few years we got\nThings around the house after we paid off the day you know cat or a kitchen point thousand dollars and different stuff like that and then uh we really started hearing them worried oh probably though three years ago\nHow well done well this this was probably\nYou know this is the typical total money make over reader or financial piece university a tender it's about seven years or house gets paid for and everything else too in the process so very very well done so what put you on the side a journey tell me what happened how did you get started\nProbably vote on that rap we bought the house that I hadn't heard of your stuff in church one time and uh I got her the name of it really did anything and then we moved on your show you've got five to ... and I happened to see it and then really kind of I Know all your stuff was all about\nAnd I know right around that at the data that we've got to do this stuff and candidates how it all began\n[laughter] whatever it took a class\nOr anything like that but we did actually teach one class but we never take the class but it's mostly in your pocket every day and that's that's kind of began\nGood deal so Alison he comes in and said he's worth listening this weird gum and radio he wants to pay off everything would you say\nI was actually really on board with that I never had a problem with like over spending that was partly warm

two years old you might get two hundred I mean you guys are you are going to be so wildly this is awesome\nAnd it was really cool we paid off the house on his birthday so when we had it in there and they said well let's just wait until the actual birthday so we we always remember that day um so it was awesome all four of its land and take it for all jammed up for it so it's got\nThat's fun very well done how many kids do is have you got\nTwo boys what ages\nSix and Benjamin just turned three\nSo you've changed your family tree have insurance\nOh yeah they don't know anything other than they've been born into I've never having a credit card which is pretty often\nIt was very awesome\nSo proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\n[laughter] actually talking about that a little bit earlier I mean when my parents are very proud and you know ... ... you know some other people oh we've got to poke fun a little bit you know making something and basically now my friends or anything like that and they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house or shut up yeah that's pretty interesting very neat\nWell well done guys very well done what do you tell me the key to getting out of debt is\n[noise] being diligent went there and stay on track\nYeah even when you see when you grew up I mean I can be the one that would be the most uh as all my idea but when I Want something or I like stuff\nSo [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing and I don't want to put up the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient [laughter] hardest thing\nNo well you did it for seven and a half years you live like no one else now you can live and give like no one else you're just great\nOkay good and um okay the uh the thing is is\nWant to keep an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are probably keep one of six months worth of expenses\nAnd no one's forcing anybody to invest in anything um the the thing I finally figured out and they took me a long time to get there and it may take you a little while to get there is that buying a mutual fund\nIs not risky and does not keep me up at night if I understand that mutual fund and ... track record let me give you an example of how I Know that would be true for you you bought two houses neither time does anyone give you a guarantee\nThat they would not go down in value\nThat day crew and they might have actually gone down in value back in two thousand I but you didn't get scared and sell them as you thought well real estate a workout you know now\nThat's what that means is you're looking at the track record of real estate not the guarantee 'cause there's not one\nI'm looking at the track record and going you know I'm Seventy three I've watched houses go up my whole life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if I go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that is looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around since ... means you observe really goes up in value over time right right and so that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around sense or one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um it's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent now that's the average some years it went down\nSome years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees I felt like that's a pretty stable neighborhood oh and out of the last ten years it'd only been when I bought it back then I mean\nIt had only lost money to two out of ten times all the other years it made money and over the scope of ten years it made money\nSo it was pretty calm growth in income type mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay\nI Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market 'cause they buy some little stupid company in the company goes on and they lose all their money because they're just playing with their golfing buddy told 'em there\nBut I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks it has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag or even twenty or drag record and I can actually look at it and go okay what's it averaged over the last ten years what's your leverage over the last Twenty years and how many times has actually been down now is that a guarantee that it won't\nGo down in the future it's not a guarantee but your house wasn't either [noise] and if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one time to three times out of Twenty years\nYou wouldn't panic you'd hold on to the house and you know let it come back up and that's how I first got comfortable with mutual funds 'cause you know Rick in my late twenties on went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money\nOn like risk but\nI also don't like money invested in or sitting in an account making one percent when I could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund this average eleven percent four Seventy five years\nAnd it only does half of what it used to do well that still five and a half percent\nHalf I mean it's like a really shock to go do half of what it's done for Seventy five years it's got to be really bad I mean it's like\nThe the worst possible ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm going to beat your annuity I'm gonna beat everything\nIf it does and that gave me a lot of comfort and and you know and again on but\nBut the reason you're lying awake at night is you didn't think about in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well and and so just take your time and learn take your time and learn if you need some help sit down with one of our smart buster pros we will not endorsed people and they're not people that worked for us but we don't endorse the smart Mr pros unless they have the heart of a teacher\nBecause we don't want you to invest money in white and I I don't want you to that I think it's that means you didn't understand what you invested in or you did understand and you put it in some stupid\nYou shouldn't be lying awake at night with your investments just like you shouldn't be lying awake when you bought the house in Texas you bought your home should be laying awake at night I was with that and so\nIf you go on the website ... um put in your information they will drop down a list of smart Mr pros in your area Saddam talked when I'm there is no obligation just learn the more knowledge you have about something\nThe more calm you are about it\nIt's as simple as something like driving a car\nThe very first time I got behind the wheel of a car I think I was probably about ten years old ... told me I could move the car down the driveway and um the gravel driveway and I think I emptied all of the gravel out of the driveway because I think I just stepped on the accelerator floor border to end just dug a hole what the ... of the guard\nAnd the first time ever drive a car you remember how nervous your whether it was on a field or in a parking lot and then the first time you drive on on the road you remember how nervous you were ... and then but you know what I'm thinking about it now your ... your brain auto pilots the car is or what happens is you have learned to do something\nThat has risk because you can record car there's no guarantee it has written what you've learned to do it and the knowledge\nAnd the practice has given you a piece and you do it without your heart rate even change and you don't lay awake at night on a cashier I drove a car tomorrow\nIt don't it doesn't bother you even though you're taking risk\nBut it's practice and

Arkansas one hundred and twenty eight thousand dollars paid off in Seventy eight months making sixty one twenty two counties down let's hear a debt free scream\nThree line one\nCreated my budget and I'm trying to get my fiance on board with it out to have someone on board buddies not all the way [laughter] but my my question is is how do we work on baby step to pay off all of our debt while also trying to cash flow a wedding\nOkay cool so how much debt do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinances are together now they're not together you're not married okay gets me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car and\nI have about forty four thousand seven hundred in student loan\nOkay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred okay\nAnd what is his income his income is about thirty eight that was like what is your income about thirty three thousand north and when are you wanting to get married when's the wedding in September twenty ninth next year\nShe got twelve much good okay so you're not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income [noise] those deaths math but I Would\nLike to do our best exactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly understand you're just there is to be serving mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out yet so given that that's the situation we need to have a modest wedding would you agree with that\nYes okay she'll ... we do have help from his parents my parents oh good how much are they chipping in a while his\nParents are paying for that catering and the reception many of which is a huge chunk of it\nYeah and then um the venue is free and we're getting married at the Capitol Grounds for\nFree good\nAnd then um we my parents paid for that dress and then they are paying off though for it um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nOkay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what\nFor decoration I'm renting things like for the linens and stuff like that and flowers you think that's too much\nI've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding mhm it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually yeah the dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually\nOn the preachers not usually that much\nOf our friend is actually doing it right\nSo so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for ... linens a lot of people have a really nice wedding the whole wedding for ten grams okay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for and that includes ... Princess Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have um champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I kinda let me too that that's how I went broke so [laughter] so if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of we want to get out of debt you know I I'm going to just make up a number of you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both\nHandy I liked him a good thing\nI'm going to say I'm gonna say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. dot camera up OK okay you you could change it you could get for you could make it eight you can change it later OK okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first okay before you start your total money might go\nOkay I'm going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I wish I knew that I Would\nSay to save up for the wedding and then hey you know and I want you to do that and like too much okay perfect and then two months I wanted passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay and then we're going to start the debt snowball each individually\nDo not run your money together until you're married\nI Know you said you are it's a bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally\nBecause if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay it's stuff like a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your debt\nAnd you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what setting up here\nSo um the the other way you could do this since you've got a whole lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nAnd you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get to come home from the honeymoon okay the actual gonna have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do yeah I Know what I mean she's still going to be there when you get out in the honeymoon the I've got to get rid of VIX you'll notice over the next year or two but we're hoping yeah I was the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agreed to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's okay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that yeah it's just\nPossible downside is all there and upside is very little if you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks George or that okay\nBut then if something God Forbid happen everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm\nSo cool cool congratulations and we'll send you a wedding gift is called the book the total money make over hold on Kelly's going to pick up emotion that out to you very cool stuff\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five or ... is on Facebook day

in the company quarterback and the company quarterback and the company um but we never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do\nAnd you know what that did it protected us from doing some stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that we did in the money do stupid stuff and if you do something stupid and you pay cash for\nIt it doesn't hurt near as much
