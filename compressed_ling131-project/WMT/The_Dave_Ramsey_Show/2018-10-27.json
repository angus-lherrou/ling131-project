four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is you're probably\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that adds up to more than about fifty percent of your take on pay or fifty percent of your income now you did just cut your income down substantially when mama came home I got that part\nBut still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still going to take a weapon on which toy you sell but um you know I'm getting out of this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number two I'm getting out of that but even if it had benefitted you even if you got a fifty thousand dollar you're raised because of it I used that fifty thousand declare that debt the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nA no no I Would sell some toys but I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets\nAnd on your houses it's generally OK temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone but I Want you to do once you're rolling stock\nAnd stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep the around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff's going to be fifty thousand about a blink of an eye\nAnd then scratch your head and wonder why you broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to sell which was the house and you got surprised by me selling your toys but I you know whatever you want or your toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way\nI'm a boat in a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but that problem with all of it is it goes down in value and so it needs to be

business and I wanted\nTo be employee base but my question is for that new one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work although I have people had people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you're just doing all the work and honing your job I got ya okay right very great so now I'm going to Atlanta ... now I Hope to work on your business not just in it okay good\nRight and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better can give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\nWell when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so um you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you they can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them\nAnd so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what do they want to wear the more they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nThat's actually see that coming so different benefits are very difficult for the business with them or twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate side benefits like

Seventy thousand most of the student loans\nOkay so Seventy plus about fifty yeah\nAbout fifty four actually okay\nRight um well the rule of thumb I use is is you don't want to own vehicles that are more than half your annual income and if you discover through going through financial base and you make the phone call like you're making is can we be debt free but the house in two years if we keep the cars\nAnd your answer is no\n... I mean something's got to give here I don't know what it is but something's got to do and so if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car where'd you get your values are those private sales values are wholesale or a dealer offer what\nAre those are trading values\nOkay so you could literally sell them for more than that possibly yes how's your credit\nOh no you definitely could you ... you saw it for more than trade in ... value I mean you saw it for a price I all male on Craig's list so um how's your credit\nI'm lying in the tank I went through a divorce couple of years ago\nUm have you all this money to these these two Carlin's where the loans\n\nI Believe they're both through Ford Motor credit for\nIt so you've not got any easy way to finance the difference\nUh well my wife for credit scores about an eight hundred\nOkay she would just do it all in her name\nThen yes uh-huh okay\nAnd you don't you were going to drive the five hundred dollar cars one driver and then there's other cardio is going to be your second driver\nYes uh-huh okay\nSo if you sold a Twenty one thousand dollar car for twenty ... twenty four that gives you about three to throw at the other deal and the Eighteenth probably worth more like Twenty one or twenty two\nSo it's probably walk in and and the whole if those are trading values I'm not a ... year only about six and the whole here\nUm that's yeah that's not the end of the world um I I Would only do that if I moved down into a car that had a value of a hundred thousand dollars\nOkay and when you're the problem with your trading them in is you're not going to get as much for them so that part I'm really not up for I'll tell you what let's don't do that let's uh let's sell the Twenty one thousand dollar car that's worth actually more than Twenty one\nAnd buying our bike you try to sell it for maybe I'm going to guess and say let's say for instance that would bring twenty twenty four that puts three in your pocket unless bought three thousand dollar car with that\nOK okay and um then let's get the other car sold for as much as it will sell for and just borrow the difference\nFrom the credit union and your wife's name\nWas her credit check and I get your three dollars or a car in a hoop the\nBut she got still got Seventy thousand dollars over here to deal with student loans much you're making one twenty six year you can do that and within a couple of years easy Eighteen months or so and so then we're going to move up in car once we're out of debt and have your emergency fund and ...\nSo we're not going to drive these who peace but maybe two years is what it sounds like maybe two two and a half years I'm\nOkay and that gets you clear but you yeah your car poor you have a car mess on your hands are right to observe that and um\nYou know at a minimum I'm getting rid of one of them but I I like your idea of getting rid of both of them if you were to do a trade in with the dealer though\nYou're going to make a lot less on these cars because they're going to give you trade in that's all they do and it's not 'cause they're evil or something they just have to run cell by car make a profit they don't they're not in the break even business during the profit business\nAnd so um you know a trade in through a dealer probably not going to help you achieve your goals nearly as fast it could throw a difference in five or six thousand bucks in this discussion\nEasy if not more the difference in trade in value and privacy on these two vehicles Tracy is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Tracey how are you\nI'm good good I'm I Am here I did buy your book here in the whole program with them by it currently Iran I've got a book that you buy I brought back to you and then that money maker\nFinancial piece book and the

I'm always thinking along spirit clients and with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... corridor very seriously I'm interested in a book called the ... of Jesus\nI'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or like you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the production of ... says it was kind of transcribe a written transcribe by Levi Dowling\nTranscribe it from the classic record\nOr no offers on has gone for book of remember is another way of putting it [laughter] I'm headed with this book because it gets her wealth in many ways for for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covers like that so called this thing here is that his wife\nAre highly ... ... years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus karma their price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers and I've had it with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat oh yeah ours is that I'm going\nTo determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're ... I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in for\nAnd this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and new Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense dome we of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I ... I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time\nIn the missing so called years I'm ... because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those are the only one I'm familiar with recovery ... you're\nA good wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot of ... about her book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier to a different color you are talking about the liar along the lines of\nIt you you appreciate the freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or their metabolism or whether it's got him or her so that we really appreciate that freedom is just that you should stay there for you to worship your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside as a as a sure I have an edge because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we have a responsibility not where I felt individually or can\nWe collectively couldn't agree more have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about it the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and or write or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think would hold us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot ah\nFor people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great thank\nYou so much for jumping in an open lines and a look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet them make that decision I Want to think a George ...

week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named Annie medicines Taylor becomes the first person to take violently from side to side by the Rapids and then propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops and speaking engagements Taylor same cooled and she was unable to make the fortune for which she had this week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule viewer governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River\nFour thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world at the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City\nSo I'm going to temporarily stop the four oh one K. your house is not the problem you're toys or your problem and your student loan is your problem\nA hundred thousand dollars worth of toys when you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year as backward\nGuy because they're all going down in value you shouldn't have toys stuff was wheels and motors that add up to more than about fifty percent of your take on gay or fifty percent of your income now you didn't just cut your income down substantially when mama came home I got that part\nBut still you were over you were at a hundred percent even when she was working\nSo you got too much tied up and things going down in value that's a bigger problem than your houses and you're staring down the barrel of a fifty thousand dollar debt that you need to clear I Would say you ought to clear that and\nIt's probably going to take your three years in the setting if you stop everything vacations eating out and for one gays and sell a toy or to it's probably still gonna take a weapon on which way you sell but um you know I'm getting all this debt\nBecause it hasn't benefitted you number one number two I'm getting out of that but even if it had benefitted you even if you've got a fifty thousand dollar you were raised because of it I use that fifty thousand to clear that that the first thing first order of business but I really don't think your house was the problem I probably would sell some toys\nUh no I Know I Would sell some toys I shouldn't say that so lightly um that's where your problem is you've got too much invested in depreciating assets and on your houses it's generally OK I'm temporarily would stop my four oh one K. and I would beat on this debt with a hammer until it's gone but\nI Want you to do once you're rolling stock and stuff with motors and it to be less than half your annual income now if you say your income coming up very dramatically in a very short order and you want to hold a couple of these toys or something that's fine but still you need to keep it around fifty percent or less\nA because you just got too much juice tied up and stuff that's going the wrong way it's all going down you look up and that hundred thousand dollars were stuff's going to be worth fifty thousand about a blink of an\nAnt and then scratch your head and wonder why you're broke you know you got stuff going the wrong way so\nYeah I I think you I'm probably got a pass on something that you thought we were going to show which was the house\nAnd you got surprised by me selling your toys but you know whatever you want their toys but that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes and oh by the way\nI'm a boat and a car guy I like anything with a motor and it just about but that but the problem with all of it is it goes down in value and so it needs to be a small percentage of your world\nRob is with us in Bend Oregon Hi Rob how are you\nKnow great Dane thank you so much for all the stuff you and your organization view [noise]\nUm I've got a question I have traveled the passed away of employment I've gone from jobs where I had to wear name K. two jobs that were possible careers to owning my own job and now I'm at a point where\nI'm starting a business and I wanted to be employee base but my question is for that\nNew one is an employee based business\n[noise] well that that's one where I don't do all the work oh I have people have people doing the work for me\nCool that's better than you are just doing all the work in owning your job I got ya okay Rick Berg great so now I'm In Atlanta now I Hope to work on her but it's not just in it okay good\nRight and so when it comes to compensation for the employees is it better to give them more money or or benefits or how do you balance that\nWell when your brand new and small you don't have a lot of choices the benefits of are ridiculously expensive and so\nUm you know like for instance health insurance when when you have less than ten people you can buy health insurance cheaper than you can for them [noise]\nOkay so I'd rather just get more money and let them do what they want to with us or they buy health insurance through their spouses work\nRight catastrophe that foster that kind of like ... different benefits are very difficult for the business without it or twenty people are less but you can give them other benefits that are not corporate tied benefits like treating them good a tree in my family being there when the baby is\nGoing to the ... or send them flowers for the Graham Austrian are all you can treat 'em like human beings we don't get treated that way\n[noise] this is what I've Ramsey [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids
