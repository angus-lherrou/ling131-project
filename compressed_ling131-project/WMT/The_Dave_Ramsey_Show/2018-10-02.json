Fox News as the FBI investigation continues into judge Brett Kavanaugh for allegations of sexual assault President Trump sticking by him at a rally in Tennessee and supporter of congresswoman Marsha Blackburn president\nAnd they thought they paid for life and now they're facing extremely high premiums to keep them going\nRecent wave of lawsuits which were gang cropping up around twenty Fifteen of targeted universal life policies sold in the eighties and nineties ensures offered an attractive guaranteed minimum interest rate the policy holders of about four to five percent\nSupported by higher interest rates set by the federal government during this time but a decade of rock bottom\nInterest rates in the wake of their financial crisis hurt insurers profitability reducing the return on the bonds an underpinning their products\nAnd so they jacked the rates so here's what happens with the universal live policy why these things are happening why people are pissed off about it\nSo you're told that if you pay a premium you'll have the policy of your whole life a portion of the premium goes to pay for the insurance and a portion goes into your investment called cash value\nThe problem is these things are based on the insurance and some of them is based on A R T which is an annual were noble term\nIf you think about it every year you live you're more likely to dodge statistically forty six year olds more likely to live to die statistically than a forty five year old on average Seventy six year old is more likely to die than fifty six year old on average statistically speaking so they charge more\nIt costs more because of the probability of death to ensure someone who's older or by get that and so if the let's say you had a hundred dollar a month or two hundred dollar a month premium okay and if it started out at age\nThirty five and the cost to cover you at age thirty five was fifty dollars a month of the two hundred then you'd have a hundred and fifty going into investment that should be just fine right but then what happens is over time\nThe cost to cover you let's say let's get you up to age sixty might be two hundred and fifty dollars you're only paying two hundred\n... fifty dollars coming from eating your savings up that you put in\nAnd so your insurance costs goes up every year to the point that it passes the premium it eats up the savings when the savings is gone the insurance company comes to you knocking on your door and says now\nIt costs three hundred dollars a month for you to just have insurance no savings\nBecause not only have as the increasing premium or eaten up what you were paying or the increasing cost of insurance eaten up your premium but it's also going over that and eaten up your savings now there's nothing left and we're not going to cover you anymore unless you pay this new higher premium for insurance\nOnly you just got screwed by buying a bad badly designed horrible financial products and so when all these guys are\nDoing if you don't understand the index universal yeah flexible premium yes\nI Do understand that and I've seen this happen I've met with these people when they're sixty five years old and their insurance that they paid into for forty years has has completely self destruct did and now they're standing there with nothing\nAnd they paid huge premium is if they paid a one twentieth as much they'd had term insurance over all that same twenty year period of time\nAnd they could've invested and then nobody is going to tinker with their investments and steal their investments to pay insurance premiums to some dead gum insurance company if it if your if your insurance product has ...\nIf you have a life insurance policy that has a savings component to it it's building up cash value you're getting screwed [noise]\nThe worst of the worst for these things actually the worst the worst of the old fashioned whole life officers these things are right behind them\nBut at least the

enough troubles and trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I

ramp she showed\nHey thanks nice to talk to your technical man what's up so I'm Wondering if it would be okay to sell my condo um [laughter] that is completely paid for a huge part of the fun to do a career change and pay for school flash living expenses that will be working part time or going back to school\nYou're single or married ... years old married mhm\nOkay and what is a career shift you want to do\nI'm so I'm a registered nurse and right now I'm In management um and I want to go back to school to be a nurse practitioner gotcha okay and how long will that take a it's going to be about three years and once it cost a forty five thousand\nAnd then you sell the condo and your rent and you use the money from the condo to live on while you go to school and pay for school\nI was I was actually thinking about saving up for money and the next year to put down on a house on a Fifteen year alone and um so you know by by the mortgage\nAnd how you're going to pay for a house if you're not working\nOr that we are hoping I could have a some saving for some of the funds from the condo go toward um living expenses paying for school a cutter\nYeah you're not qualify Murray mortgage if you don't have an income [noise]\nOutdoor I'll still be working parttime out they'll be making about forty five thousand a year oh okay your wife work outside the home\nYeah she's a cousin told us and she makes what I'm about twenty five\nOkay and she argued ... are you going to be in the same city doing all of this\nYear okay\nI'm not concerned about homeownership until three years from now if you want to if you want to do this and just keep all the cash available and make sure you hit your goal\nThat's fine let's make the turn with no debt and when we get out of the get out of school inland the you know nurse practitioners job and uh your income probably going to go up in that situation\nPretty substantially um then and you've done all of this for a hundred percent that free then you think about buying cars whatever you buy in the next two years is not going to be a house you keep two years later\nOkay because you're going to move up and income your income is going to go ... when you come out of school agreed\n[noise] yeah yeah\nAnd so it's a different house world than all of a sudden for you I don't mind if you rent\nSomething and just keep all your cash available to ensure that this dream of curves debt free because when I Dream of cars and its financial debt it often turns into a nightmare\nAnd we don't want to go that route but I Love the whole plan the idea and the will you know your willingness to sacrifice to get it done and reset your life in your thirties that's that's pretty cool man\nA pretty gutsy and I like it a lot um and obviously you've investigated

know that it's necessary but probably wouldn't do it\nI'm\nA I froze my kids when they were minors as soon as the law came out allowing you to freeze in law just shifted the other day and in late ... in late September allowing you to freeze a credit bureau without any fees now like you were allowed to charge you a fee to freeze it or an freezing\nUp until a late September twenty first the law shifted so um yeah I Would freeze it and and the only reason is if someone were to steal his identity give his Social Security number somewhere and try to open an account and his name\nIs ... the company's trying out there are trying to open the account with checks his credit they'll find it frozen and they would it would prevent that type of identity theft and a fraud\nUm now if they don't check it it will prevent anything\nAnd only about three out of ten credit card applications that they actually run the credit on the auto issue the other seven so that's how they issue credit cards on the people in dogs because they don't even bother to check and if they check they'll discover you know a three year one year old with a frozen credit\nCounseling all fall while this is fraud and they're not going to issue the car [laughter] so it will help you a little from and I probably would do it\nAnd I'm probably not probably I Would go to Sandra insurance when I get ... protection on

I mean literally ... like the biggest redneck on the planet mhm and a car as overeating I had to turn the heat on and I was thinking is is is it worth it\n[laughter] I Do not have even\nBeen there done that yeah it's also very cool what do you tell people the key to getting out of that is Sarah\n[noise] a lot of sacrifice you definitely have to communicate and sat down into our budget and we did the cash only ... you know to this day even out or that phrase we're still doing the caste system\nOnce that money's gone it's gone we have an Eighteen month old at home ... okay harmonies out it out you know but I think too you just have to attract thank God he has gotten us everything there if you read along the way\nI'm lending last summer ...

I'm In a ... he went out and what kind of did as a loan\nAnd credit cards I had 'em all ages medically several major medical issue happened mhm and I had the military\nAnd place and the insurance company is fighting the ... the year and a half and he still hasn't given me my money and I wouldn't be in that situation and um and then it I mean my money\nMhm um so I just got a lawyer and um it just frightened letter basically right now 'cause I Can't afford to get really wanted to like train the legal mhm\nAnd so that's the situation um and it really hard because of all we have had things in place and all\nAre you currently disabled and I am what's the nature of the network which the nature of your disability\nIs a federal thing on right now Cheryl medical issues so fiber around they found out I just had attacked on August twenty twenty and and that's how I handled the condition [noise] Mm\nSo what kind of up is the fifty one doesn't use a credit card so I'm not sure which credit cards\n[noise] um [noise] [noise] um\n...\nMost of it is credit card and a half per alone so for one credit card company it started out they sent me a letter and if I paid twenty five thousand and they would you know I'm just going and calling them all and the town I'm I'm having a hardship to have a lower how much I\nWould undoing good for them to lower you don't have the money\nWell not having any time I was thinking but it's still not enough [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight thousand a year and that much because he lost his job when I first got her ... ... um when I ...\nI heard how are you not Anderson John long receiving disability\nNo I'm a plant down the shore and an economy dropped off on permanent disability to state but I'm In and out of work so much that\nNow it's going to be really really low and not even want to be when I couldn't get you know ... and credit here in in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point\nAt which would they know the lawyer and so I'm trying to find out he said he came on the economy is really going to see if I should do is having on it I could do with that and what every team and then I did it their team he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they don't want to get it out get out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only nine Ninety I don't understand\nYou gave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankruptcy I think we give them anything oh I don't get anything aren't so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans today right\nNow not right now on on that and we're so ... where are you\nGoing to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year and they just sit there the worst cases would suit you're right\nYeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets do can do you own something as valuable\nWhile I have yeah I came home that living at home and I looked at the equity and now I'm at home um have about fifty thousand and now I Can't sell the house though because if I tried to tell if I did that algae either go\nMarket yourself\nAnd then because that's how how are you like six seven eight out and now I Am I mean you know I'm Ari how are you all for like one out in like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm why can't you sell your\nHome a lot of them in the argument that are again\nWhy can't you know your house\nAnd one of the doubt that I don't live in when I'm speaking out and about fifty thousand and why why can't you sell it because you have a lot of for it and people are telling them for ... and you are what\nUm Ninety eight\nOkay so Charlotte and get out much you can out of it and pay your bills\nTo pay off my dad with that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt you when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills somehow bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and there'll be forced to be paid against your bills and I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these\nAnd you can probably shuttle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you know what I mean money so this is a way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this\nAnd so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where you going to be in three years what's your long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there\nThat's got to be your next step because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're do workers' comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but you know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future and and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it selling it taking the equity using\nThat money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whenever you get out of it and settle that fifty one thousand that spot negotiate with them get that in writing before you send them any money but I think if you work your way through this to file bankruptcy if you want finally there's only sold the house or your way [noise]\nSuppose this

a job yes my dad has a job when does seem a little while he makes so I think a hundred thousand dollars a year maybe\n... so she doesn't have a ... she didn't have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of bending that's the problem she likes to spend money mhm\nMhm and how old are you I'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering am I wrong\nNo you're not wrong at all\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I\nGot on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story is your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right now to tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad\nWho could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually I guess my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch your show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a

there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save so that we have you know we live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real cause you're he's got standing he's got a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and I'm just not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's ... you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was at my house on the show and I would just sit down and have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time and it's time for him to deal with it now\nThat that's what I'm saying
