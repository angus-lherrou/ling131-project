percent penalty plus your tax rate so if you're on the twenty two percent tax bracket as an example in the year twenty Eighteen\nThat would be a thirty two percent hit on your money so Heather that's the equivalent of saying Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty two percent interest to pay off my car\nAnd the answer would be no that's stupid and so don't cash out retirement no that stupid don't do that unless it's just unless your backs against the wall and you can't breathe which case might be a need to sell the car actually if that were the case not\nStill not cash out the retirement but if

you know\nWe don't count it I mean you're making two forty here you've got no payments that worried Thirty years oh\nMy God this is talk of gr age\nYeah and I you know we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know it wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we work hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure what that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we were not around the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a town people I mean when we're hosting a leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and he has we never fight about money mhm also really cool so do they listen when you tell them at\nFive or six years mhm um\nIt was probably may this year I bought a two thousand Eighteen foreigner and so the upgraded package so it was like forty one thousand we put eleven thousand down with a trade in and everything I'm about thirty five thousand on it together we have about twenty thousand and saving a she\nEssentially what I got from her that she kind of wants to skip to babysit three that she doesn't have any other day that there are only ... the foreigner in the house ... um she got electives to babysit three to\nPrepare to get out and so that would put her paying you know the normal mortgage and he um gets that all my bills that we have in saving everything else until she gets out a note there she's still she teaches ads on the side as well so she's got additional income what's your question um\nI wanted to know if we should tackle this foreigner together mhm and get this thirty five thousand out of the way or if you think that we just keep going about it the way that we're going to let her continue to save and then meet\nTackled a foreigner and that eventually when she\nThink you're running your actual tension that occurs when you're trying to\nAct like you're married but you're not you're 'cause you're vacillating back and forth between acting like a married couple are acting like room mates and you're ... so it's my bills her ... her bills but we did this and we did that\nAnd yeah under in a legal sense from ... from the law perspective there's not a week\nYeah you have a roommate from old from the perspective of the law you see what I'm saying and so if if she decides to walk out the door whoever's names are on these things or who's going to be holding the bag\nWhoever's you name directly savings accounts which can be there so you're in relation Lee you're struggling back and forth in vacillating so um do you guys can do what you want to do obviously you're grown ups and you've done very well you're making a hundred and twenty year congratulations [noise]\nUm you called and asked me so I Will tell you what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes okay yeah\nI Would get married tomorrow\nAnd then there would be no you're for one runner your savings account you're this it would only be weak and then I Would work the baby steps exactly as prescribed\nIt's what I Would do I think you're making really good money I think you're probably the stupid for rent or off or get rid of it before she gets out and I want to learn about I Want her to line up her career\nOr for what she's going to do as she comes out of the military but you ... the thing is you you just can't vacillate between you know looking in the refrigerator and going well that's my mustard how 'bout that mustard\nUm you know back in ... or no that's our mustard because we're we're doing this together oh why can't the ... and there's there's it Josh poll\n... ... people partnerships um there's all kind of statistical research that shows you're going to have substandard results in your finances as well as other areas of your life until you but marriage in the equation\nAnd so you do what you want to do I'm I'm just an old guy advising you I've got several reasons for that advice but um that's what I Would tell you to do\nIf you were my little brother that's what I Would tell you to do I'd say get married and stop trying to play both sides of this coin just do it and you know you've been together forever anyway you do in life together it's a technicality really but then you have to say from that point\nForward we we have a foreigner we have a house we have a savings account we have a plan we are going to submit ourselves to the baby steps we are going to stick with is we are going to go that route\nAnd and you become friends at that point we week right [laughter] and so that that's what I Would do it cleans up everything and then walk right down it and if you want to say well\nYou know we're facing an emergency with the loss of her income and so we're not going to work the baby steps right now we're just gonna pile of cash and get ready for a baby step that's not really skipping the baby step three that's just saying we're not going to do anything right now in Palo money if you want to make that decision you can 'cause you're panicked about the loss of her income\nI don't think I'm panicked about the loss of her income though um\nI mean because a I think she's going to have another income lined up she's got from now the June to figure that out and be I don't know what percentage of your income she of our income once were married that she represents so that that's the other thing you gotta look at the variable will is with us in California Hi well welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nOr if they're driving me sure what's up so I I've got\nA four home that I own a three hour rentals at this point uh was obviously my primary residence two of those trials are paid off and the third I owe about one Seventy on I guess my question is\nI have the cash to pay that a rental property off completely [laughter] I'm Wondering if I should versus what the ultimate goal is to get more investment properties so I was wondering what your thoughts are on that\nOK is the ultimate goal to have a bunch of investment properties and a bunch of debt on them are a bunch of investment properties that are paid for\nA pay for of course okay and then let's start with that okay that's what I did\nUm the second time the first time I had him on that and I lost and everything but the second time I don't borrow money and more and so I I you know paid off all my properties and I use the increase cash flow that was resulting\nTo buy the next property and by the next one and of course every time you buy another one you got that much more casual oh that's a debt free cash does I mean these things cash for like crazy when you know what I mean that right\n[noise] right it changes everything the only thing how much do you do your residence or my primary is about to forty okay the rental the rental is one Seventy and you have how much cash not three twenty okay I won't pay off my primary first\nOff the primary first yup yup and are either ...\nEither way you're increasing ... well the reason is simply this year your heart is part of this equation it's not simply a math equation\nAnd when you're homeless paid off for you think differently you can't keep yourself from doing it you will make different decisions um it ... it calms you down\nYou know you just chill and not in a way where you lose your ambition or something like that\nBut um you relax or because you're walking around the back yard when their shoes on and you're at it the grass feels different on your feet the bar or really a slave to the lender I've experienced that and I've had many many many people experience that over the

which is a good idea so Chris in your range of income in business in marketing a career but your worst fear and your best year\nOh I never really made a whole lot of money on I don't feel like I ever really put my degree to work um I Would say my best year this is my wife and I's combined gross income was probably eighty thousand\nMhm I'm currently currently we make a between the two of us a grocer sixty thousand so we don't make a whole lot of money in ... in your worst\nYear when you started out probably oh just you know when I was Twenty one I'm making two Ninety an hour I think I made forty thousand a year\nInto okay and your degree is in what\nA sin business of marketing um I worked at a at a grocery store for thirty seven years or worked my way up\nAnd was a butcher actually and I was forced out about three years ago because they said I was too expensive and at that point in time I kinda\nThought I had enough money to retire but I didn't want to pay health insurance so I just am a courier now and I don't make a whole lot of money I make fourteen dollars an hour mhm but so I make enough to cover our living expenses as our retirement money is just sit and then throw it so I'm just kinda hold back\nOkay so you never mind over eighty but you're sitting on a one point eight million dollar net worth a tell me how you did that once the key to that\nUh the key is is uh one thing I did it was kinda neat that first car I bought I did take a loan out\nFour and a ever since I paid that first car I just kept\nMoney going into the bank so I every car after that I just paid cash or a and live within my name's I'm\nWorking at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and they would buy peanut butter and Dale bread and that's what they would try to live on the and I did not want to see myself doing that so\nI never uh I've never I Do I Do carry a credit card and I know that's against your teachings I pay off the balance every month and a never paid any credit card fees at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up at one point four or five million a mutual funds\nUm when I did work a this grocery chain every time I got a raise I put it into retirement um I think before I was forced out I was twenty two percent of I check into my four oh one K. every every week\nDid you guys go on vacation and enjoy your lives as you were living in
