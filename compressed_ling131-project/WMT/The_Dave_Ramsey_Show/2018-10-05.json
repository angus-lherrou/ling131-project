ago the started this\nUm [noise] well it really does go back a long time um for the first twenty seven years of our marriage we really didn't have what you call do an income problem mhm I was always trying to cut our budget he was always trying to increase the income ... um and so that led to a lot of 'em credit card debt\nAnd then we decided to increase our income by going back to school but unfortunately we did that um with student loans and then we had ... in student loans\nAnd then in two thousand fourteen we finally got tired of the credit card debt and cut up the cards and that afternoon weight fell and broke his ankle\nSo that required surgery as soon as he got off the Christians are ... both of his arms and that required surgery had credit card that school loans and ... of course yeah and\nSo um and two thousand\nFifteen I sat down to do our income taxes that anyway and I looked at our income then realized we had made and those many we'd ever made ... um but we also had

university the free spirit pasture here uh did you ah what what happened then with the two of you on your interaction about money that change that process\nIt has improved\nOh yeah it did its own the first night of Nashville's university I cried through about half of it you know the Holy Spirit conviction along with you know the message that was coming through just um\nIt changed in in you know it really\nIt takes a change in mindset is what I say I didn't I didn't change my mind set you know the Bible says that were transformed by the renewable remind me and I had to have my mind renewed\nThe funny thing is I was working at FedEx part time delivering packages and I would listen to your show mhm I wasn't doing a thing you said there's nothing you after you every day you know so the fees are being planted but you know when that time came I just knew it was time\nYeah the entertainment squid and the actual listening began as you know\nFun very cool you know that's what what I signed the ... uh the total money make over a book with the scripture I use Romans twelve to to be transformed by the renewing of your mind now don't be conform to this world they're crazy out there and\nDon't be don't be like everybody else are nuts and uh my pastor always said don't let the world teach theology you know and\nUh so let's stop you gosh so what do you tell people when they find out you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a guard for five or six years and then what do you think you should we get another payment and uh so we have not had a car payment for four\nYears uh were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old wow but we drove it\nUp here from South Carolina this morning and it might have found so it made it finally gets us where we need to go and never again never again\nWell now you don't really pay much you can save up in ... by a little better car that's right yeah uh what about you know early what are usually the keys to getting out of that are\nA very random on average it'll make about one point two to one point seven percent rate of return horrible about like you're stupid savings account right\nAnd I'm In of course it's very front loaded the first three or four years all of the extra that you're paying instead of going to savings goes to fees and so you get no cash value build up for the first one to three years\nSomething like that and um and then of course when you die the only thing they pay even though you've paid extra create the savings account\nThe only thing they pay is the face value and so the money you paid in a savings account you lose so you have a savings account that has a bad right of return in when you die they keep your money that's just not a good plan um the uh the universal life is the newer version of that um or the next newest version whole life's the oldest\nOf the cash value plans the universal life was in an attempt to make it a little bit better and\nIt pays a I'm a better rate of return typically I'm most universal life will average net of fees around four and a half to five percent rate of return uh so it's more like an annuity a ... with an insurance company more like a fixed annuity top of a product\nAnd then the the biggest downfall with universal not only that keep your money when you die but the other downfall is is the you pay one set amount per month\nAnd the insurance cost the amount that goes to insurance versus the amount that goes to savings the amount that is going to the insurance goes up every year as you get older\nSo that by the time you get really old with universal the amount you're paying may not even cover the insurance\nYou have a zero going into savings and sometimes some of the money's coming out of the cash value to actually support the policy because you're not paying enough to pay their insurance premiums because the insurance costs ... universal goes up every year a but even with that it's slightly better\nThan whole life or both you know it's just one socks on one such worse you know that's all it is and then the next one up the next version that came out was called variable life\nAnd if you ever hear of that that's one another version and basically what they did there's in the savings portion I put mutual funds in there and you can choose the mutual funds inside your very alive policy and you get a much better right of return\nNet of fees you'll make about seven percent usually on that\nBut the problem is a mutual funds were paying twelve to Fifteen and you're making seven which tells you what the fees are they charge a lot of fees on these things\nAnd so um do there's just a fee everywhere every corner you call around where you're dealing with an insurance company so the bottom line is with life insurance anytime you're saving money\nWith life insurance companies you're going to get feed the death you're going to get a sub standard rate of return and an almost every case they're going to keep your money when you die\nAnd so that all makes it just a horrible place to\nPay money into a savings account that when you keep your ... that they keep your money when you die and so that's why we recommend and always have recommended than I personally have always bought once I got my head screwed on and understood how the math work um I actually bought whole life one time from a rip off company called northwestern mutual but I was in my twenties and\nI was stupid um do a lot of stupid stuff in my life and that's one of the stupid things so yeah unbelievable but ah and they're like the most expensive one of the worst ones out there you know so horrible horrible products so we buy term life insurance which costs about five dollars a month instead of a hundred dollars a month or one twentieth\nFor the same amount of insurance and I put my other Ninety five dollars anywhere else\nFor investing I put it in a fruit jar and I come off better off than those guys and so I put it any anywhere else and\nAnd so what you end up with is eighty percent of the people that sell life insurance for a living and that's all they sell are out of the business in one year\nIn eighty percent turn over in the whole life life insurance world and here's here's why the business model is basically this the general agency hire someone in order to get to their friends and family\nAnd the News New insurance salesman is used to get to friends and family\nAnd then once you've worked through their market what's called their natural market uh then their ability to sell insurance to strangers is ... is just horrible it's it's never happens and so they very seldom may get once they run out of their list\nAnd so they milk the their list they milk their relationships and then they turn over that's why there's such a high turnover rate and that's generally the business model now I Know guys that are northwestern mutual agents or Pacific Life agents or New York live agents that have been in the business for twenty five or Thirty years but they're the ones actually learned how to sell insurance\nAnd they don't and some of them are general agents and they you know they hire people to work their list as what it amounts to knowing that they're probably not going to make it after they run through their list\nBut that's kind of how that business works and it's kind of an old model honestly it's pretty much dying on the whole life life insurance is kind of a Nineteen fifties sixties even seventies thing but by the eighties nineties and certainly up into the two thousands\nI mean no one tells you to buy cash value insurance anymore anywhere that is a credible financial mind except people to sell it\nThe only people that recommended or those salad\nYou just can't find anybody that's an independent third party like me I don't know either one I don't care what you buy I endorsed sand or for term insurance was cause I Believe in term insurance and no I don't know ... or insurance she's an advertiser but\nA whole life couldn't buy an ad on this show

you guys paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars for how long does that say about pony for months man and your range of income during that time\nYeah we started off at about a hundred K. and that we picked it up to about three hundred thousand\nWow what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm an executive recruiter for GE and then um I also teach part time with a multitude of uh on line universities\nAnd and I'm a director in HR ... like\nOh God that's my friends very cool so you're working for Robert okay cool that's a good for you guys were great income four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars what kind of that was that\nYeah it was basically student loans the majority of it about three hundred and Seventy about actually drew under sixty nine thousand of dollars about student loans and then tax bill we had about twenty nine thousand [noise] and then are too small credit card about forty five hundred and then we cash flow to wedding in about Fifteen thousand\nMan you guys have a law student loans though yeah [laughter] yeah well you know I was ... or you just overwhelmed by that that oh yeah oh yeah a lot of that and it was a show or did you cash flow every bit of this\nOh yeah yeah we\nI mean you just that that's an amazing number twenty four months even with the fabulous income you've had that's still very incredible very well done so tell me your story what happened twenty four months ago\nThat found and she and I were engaged and we had it came to the table with ICC has college education and then my college education\nAnd I'm In an astronomical so we'd have to realize like outlets and settling and very easy for is pretty much when we first start in on our marriage we immediately got on the bandwagon to pay off and are standing around\nAnd my sister and she had actually introduced um you two are only about Fifteen Years ago and I remember\nFeeling I remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and I tell them she it was like holy and you know they ran the friendly how animals with just the budgeting take it out of their way and then we just kind of Neal I just didn't we didn't have the Keith I'm really for it to just live life with us in my own\nHouse and we both made that decision to just start off and really find that very thick anywhere like we're going to do the same thing while dream that we are going to do that\nI mean you guys you had an extreme situation so you brought extreme measures to deal with it\nAnd he ... he has very very their choice while\nAmazing so what do you tell people the key to paying 'cause I mean you're the story everybody's talking about you know in in the news and all these these young people are overwhelmed with student loan debt they're all die and they're gonna you know their whole generation is stunted and all this stuff and yet\nTwenty four months later you're done with four hundred and Eighteen thousand you're impressive\nThat's amazing so what in the world what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nUm I Would probably say just getting on the same page um you know we've been married now\nTwo and a half years and I think just getting on on kind of just getting out of debt and being on the same page in terms of our money I think that was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work um you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well\nThan ... once you're out of debt but the house then baby steps three years you return to the one thousand dollar ... raise it up to three to six months of expenses and then [noise]\nUh I'm\nPast that you restart your retirement sharp putting Fifteen Percent away for retirement start saving for kids college pay off your house ... baby steps six so the houses way down the list so it it's not even gonna come up you're not get into the house right now you know the money\n... then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse which was an awesome goal ... not only will you be very employable you have the ability make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule\nAnd crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you've got all kinds of options and nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family\n[noise] um so are we the return ... investment the investment into Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree and left handed puppetry here this was actually writing ... degree and so\nIt's worth every penny you're spending on it and and a bunch more is what I'm saying so if if our goal is to get out of debt so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new debt\nYou can't get out of debt while you're getting into debt that you can get out of holding off the bottom rights so that means we gotta cash flow college so which college going cost\n[noise] uh it's about three thousand dollars a semester semesters\n\n... you know probably ... least three years worth of school\n... years three years of school so I'm thinking really twelve maybe so you you didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby in in college I I'm just now starting I mean it's ... semester one I haven't you know this\nIs okay but you don't have enough ... you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree to ride ... okay so you got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into ...\nSo you need a three thousand a semester times three our our I'm Sorry ... for three years you said it's gonna take you and ... six thousand dollars a year for three years Eighteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that okay okay and what's your household income\n'em ... it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife we're having our first baby next well in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years gonna average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars\n... okay so you're not gonna have a lot of cash to finish school and you have how much and savings\nOr twelve thousand okay ah I get\nThe feeling that emergency fund fourteen thousand\nOr your emergency fund a small you know okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps our own hold until we get college paid for\n... okay so I'm going to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be Eighteen as my very first called and then when it gets to Eighteen ... and we can talk about building the\nUh you know when you talk about taking the emergency fund down to a thousand and start working on the other day that's how much other data got not counting your house\nOr your car how much deal and the car it's about twenty five thousand oh lord and you make forty five\nWell at the time we uh we made like I said made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars an hour if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years\nOkay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at these numbers we've got an Eighteen thousand dollar uh you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we've got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd twenty five thousand dollar car ... to hear like five thousand dollar cars wanted me to hear\nOkay in the middle of this because cars not your goal right now you're going ... get all this mess cleaned up and get your education and your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay agreed yeah ... okay\n... get you ... much much much cheaper car show that you hit these goals ... what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had this ... have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got the car and then we went to stupid land\n... it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life it's like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but ... even if you're making sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchased ... it's just way too high\nAnd even if you paid cash for it in all of the middle all this show it wouldn't have made sense ... time to time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives because the good news is you'd rather than you want man 'cause your income ... going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you're ... pay cash and you know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around the elephant in the room that's his car\nIt's humid and killing you it's killing your plant it's it's it's just it's death so anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it over the phone's a triple eight eight to five five two to five dug his own Twitter isn't normal to continually adjust my
