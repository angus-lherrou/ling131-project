you want to talk career career questions we got the man here the phone numbers triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five welcome back Ken thanks for having always fun to be with you the smart conference in\nKansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connected to knit\nThank you yes it uh it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all envision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people to be around and and the right places that need to be in\nBecause if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that thing\nHere it has the proximity principle simply says in order to do what I Want to do you fill in the blank\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they all point to the to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do\nAnd where I can connect\nAnd date when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example and here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an where's Ramsey solutions need to be\nThis was a very simple principle that no matter where you're at life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity you know I've noticed that happening here\nIn our little a bird outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement space to understand who uh who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along or Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years uh in from Oregon ... from the ... moved here about the town that book tape took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm not even thinking you're mentioning right now\nUm but a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening and it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around things and the ...\nPeople and the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off and it's not that the Donald Miller or die brands your Mike Hi it interact are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we've all interacted and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy\nBut it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it it's here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you know there there's got to you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him\nCharles tremendous Jones you know as a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely dependent on the books you read and the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colonialism that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with was helping people try to demystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps\nOf putting myself around the right people in in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling staying in Hungary and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is different but as I said Saturday Kansas City and the crowd kind of laughed at this\nSo I'm I'm honest guy and I I'm saved up my marking the find I have children three and five and I'm just wondering if I Would have to go through all the training and to becoming a pilot\nBecause I feel like if they're calling for me but I'm not positive and I'm just wondering if I said\nTap into that world or if I think that the only one I'm doing in saving and then retire I mean that's pretty much where I'm at right now and I don't know I don't know what to do I get kind of stuck ...\nWhat would be wrong with becoming a pilot\nUm well I researched it hurts our our\n... and what do you mean what are you now\nI make fifty five\nPounds make a lot more than that show you issue if you spent eighty and you made twice as much as you make now that'd be a good return on investment so ... what's the rest of the problem\nUm I get away from the family\nOh now that's real ... real but let's look at that do you have you done the research what is that going to based on the cost and you're going to do it cash so that's another issue you're going to do this cash so it's going to take a little bit in a while but are you willing to do what it takes to be in the air and fly\nI think I have to put my foot\nForward and at least attempt to try and work out that you get your pilot light Obama's grant that's right if I felt like it when I Would probably say yeah\nI see the answer is unequivocally yes I don't think it's probably yes I think your heart is so clear everybody on the air can here here's what I'm telling you that you don't need to feel any guilt here's why\nYou've done the Dave Ramsey plan you're doing the play and you're going to continue to work in that job that's making you fifty five thousand you're going to castle as you go\nAnd because this is going to take maybe five seven years I'm making that up whatever it is you're going to do and as you go and that means you're not going to sacrifice that much time away from the kids number one number two you're not going to starve because you're going to stay in that day job while you're pursuing the dream job\nAnd by the time you get ready to be gone from being a pilot the kids are going to be a lot older\nAnd the kids are gonna see that mom set our mind to something and pursued it the right way and is happy and fulfilled what a tremendous life lesson and example you're going to be I don't see why you should have any guilt at all in fact I think you should be fired up about it and take one small step today\nWe might even guilt you if you didn't [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] I really appreciate it\nThanks for the call now reality is where she going to be a corporate pilot today she might be gone a lot that's that's where I'm little kids of course and that might not be our lifestyle the fish but this is a process or it's not it's not a snapshot these are not instantaneous that's where I can just push a button and decide your pilot no this is going to take some kind of doing that\nBut let's let's let's play this out real quick folks you heard this if it takes her day five to seven years to ... between the eighty thousand cash flow plus the the classes and all the training that requires to become a pilot\nShe could still stay in that day job begin to do things on the side maybe she fly some tours on the weekends again the kids are still maybe early teens but just five years removed from that they're out of the house and then she can do fulltime but she can actually fly part time\nI mean we have to look at the big picture and this lady wants to be in the skies and she can do it\nWell we've got to tell you the problem with that thing is it's addicting from what I hear oh you are stark 'cause I Know I mean I'll give you like a vast car so I Know you can't imagine how bad are get sucked into that that would be a bad idea ... I don't yeah I can tell some things I don't need to start because I don't have to finish them\nLook it's a bird no it's ... it's a pretty scary out there in so many ways barbers on Instagram can she says I have over Twenty years of experience or should I have a two page resume with all my jobs listed instead of the suggested one page\nNo which is why suggested one page but let me explain why [laughter]\nI Love those questions you know we thought this through here's why\nThe average hiring manager David spending somewhere between six and sixty seconds skinny interests me\nSo they all see all two pages anyway so if you look at the Ken Coleman show resume template how to fix your resume to Ken Coleman show dot com it's absolutely free\nGive it to read because we actually show you what to do but we explain why you're doing it that way and it's based on research so for hiring managers looking at that for less than sixty seconds\nThey want to see what's most relevant to them to see if you can help them win that's all they care about they don't want to be impressed with you they want to know can this guy or gal helped me when and so\nIrene managers not your mother they don't care they don't ... it all started all the honey Sony he'll nudge Institute of God just shoot exactly what you heard the phrase what have you done for me lately yeah think you ought to apply that to your resume we don't care about what you did Twenty years ago unless Dave it's relevant to the current role you're almost never is\n[laughter] I think that's safe to say almost never so no I think you should do one page we've designed this resume tell but to be a brochure because folks that's what it is\nI graduated with a degree in computers in Nineteen Seventy four that is of no help today exactly you can't even spell computer now it's completely different it's a completely different world show or what have you done lately that involve the computer starting all relevant it's everything about the Ken Coleman show dot com\nYou can download the resume template but resumes by themselves are worthless\nThey're completely worthless and I love that because it shocks people that they've you know this is true Ramsey solution it is you can give the data are the reality is folks that if someone's out walking your resume in to the person who's hiring for the job and said hey I Know this person through a friend of a friend or I Know them personally\nI think they're solid individual to give them a look you're buried inside of a pile and it's like playing the lottery to get your resume noticed so that's what we mean when we say you got to do the work\nTo get a connection so the relationship is attached to your resume\nFifteen thousand applications here last year we are two hundred people case in point and there was no issue is logistically impossible for us to look at every one of them ...\nAnd not to mention you motivated is each one of us to go fight eagles to bring into this organization you want to keep crazy out so we're incentivized ... just to bring in somebody that we know\nCan fit the culture and can obviously fit the role that means competency character those types of things culture fit so that's why it's so important that you have a relationship\nYou can download the resume template but don't use it by itself that's what we're saying completely free at Ken Coleman show dot com if you have questions and you want to talk to can own insurance ... show or on his podcast which are the same thing to put out there on the phone number is eight to four four\nSeven four seven\nTwenty five Seventy seven you can follow him on Facebook or Instagram\nPet Ken Coleman show all or at can Coleman on Twitter as well he's got a book out called one question life changing answers from today's leading voices\nAnd just beat the heartbeat the person that caused them to come in the first place and you're going to be fine just don't want to know everything is you don't that's okay\nBut I definitely don't [laughter]\nWell I don't I I sit in front of Fifteen million people in ... on this radio show I have to say I don't know sometimes I don't know and that's the only answer because it's the only truthful want anyway\nAnd um you know you can Google it like I can Google it lets cried together I don't know you know but um that's why I don't take a lot of tax questions on my very good at taxes\nUm that kind of stuff so you just you don't have to be everything you just got to be somebody that cares\nAnd if you're that you're going to be a great financial

and just start just just do it you know um seems like everybody we talk to appear anyway not allowed to have heard of you and I just try to spread the word to those who I think are interested\nI don't think you appreciate the so starting is a big part of it what did you guys do on a practical level what's the step by step thing would you do that allowed you to pay off your house 'cause I mean you paid off what thirty thousand forty thousand bucks a year for three years making eighty five to one then you are really watching your budget\nFade away so we didn't do anything to have um we we worked

cheerleaders\nYou know some of our close friends were very good cheerleaders we we didn't kill a lot of people at the for the first twelve months because we didn't know if it was going to work but it's hard at work and then it started working really good to have\nYeah I think I don't believe so I guess find a lot of what\nWas it pretty even did you do like forty forty forty or did you was it different of one year over another year\nWell it was it was about thirty eight thirty seven and a little heavier at the end ah\nYou see the finish line and you\nGo ahead you can see the finish line

years strange at\nA normal bro normal sucks but only normal you guys are weird that's the best compliment you can get on the day Ramsey show I'll just tell you we got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story for you to be\nNot only dead free but now to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you go along and you make good money you don't have a payment in the world you should be there for the soon well\nDone guys looking at looking like you see Grand Forks North Dakota a hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid off in thirty six months when I get eighty five to one ten\n... own\nYeah and just lean you've got to have that guideline everybody does single or married that those boundaries those guard rails and that's what your budget is it tells you what you can spend if you want to get your goals and you have a goal of twenty thousand dollars in one year\nAnd so you know I was like Seventeen hundred fifty bucks a month you're going to be paying on his car okay which means you're not going to be doing some of the stuff you're doing now\nBecause you want it because you want the car and you want it paid off true\nYeah I mean the show it's just you you just punch it in the face hard and fast hard and fast and you know I I think you can pay off in a year and I think you should commit to doing that and then save up your emergency fund up three to six months of expenses and save up your down payment for your house I think you can do it\nHold on I'm going to send you a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you right through the baby steps of exactly how to do what I'm Talking about I think you can do this if you read that book it'll show you exactly how to not only get out of that not only get your house but also become wealthy okay\nToby is with us in Topeka, Kansas Hi Toby our you\nI'm All right how 'bout yourself better than I deserve what's up\nOther quick question me and my wife are on step to um we plan on being free within six months in the ... our\nOur goal is within two years to move now will be on step three\nUm and my question is if we come in about five to ten thousand dollar short of our emergency savings bond but yet we sell the house for a pretty good profit\nCareer or some of the money from that sell the house into the into the emergency Sean in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want to go about doing\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in their we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before you watch a movie but we do need to ...\nUm well you can do what you want to do I mean you're grown up you're allowed that there is no law on any of this but um yes um what what\nBut do I think when you buy stuff that's not an emergency before you're having an emergency fund you are inviting Murphy to move in your spare bedroom\nOkay\nI think you're asking for trouble when I got an emergency fund in place I could have an emergency it was the weirdest thing but as long as I was broke my live looked like a country song\nAnd I thought that I think you're asking for it I'm so no I don't think her bond buying her car's non emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour ah your need for an emergency fund now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the three mark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later but we're comfortable with the three months of expenses\nFunds at least until we get her car or whatever these other things are that you're wanting to do that's fine but I bought her cars on emergency\nIt's not she's got a car\nSo that's how we know we don't usually emergency fund for it mark is in Orlando, Florida Hi Mark how are you doing here near better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my ... been together for about three years or very young and we would like to move on and move forward our lives and get married\nAnd living together good ah we don't know or financially stable though and we all want to be smart about it financially ... how old are you Twenty one\nOkay and what do you make\nA about thirty thirty five year mhm and what your career ah right now I'm just a warehouse worker okay so what's your plan I yeah I'm sure I ... I don't know if we should go and no no it wasn't as your career plan oh crap I thought you know\nPretend like saw young man who's a sharp young guy who's working in the warehouse or Twenty one just walked into your house and want to marry your daughter\nYeah what would you tell him I'd want to know what his dad gummed plan is right\nIs or how are you going to take care of this girl\nI Would love to take care of it like\nHannah I'm giving you a hard time brother okay if you're if you think about it that way if forces you to think about your long term prospects which is as her dad that's what he'd be looking at right he'd be saying OK guys are sharp young do\nThey not making anything right now and you work in a warehouse but everybody's got really got a really good career path he's got a plan and it's going to work out I mean by the time he's thirty one what are you going to be doing you know so I'm more concerned about that I think you can make it on thirty five does she have a job\nUh she's in school and doing a part time job at a restaurant when does she graduated from school she has about another year and a half years\nOkay and what were her degree being\nAh she's teaching\nOkay and who's paying for her school\nRight now her her parents okay\nAlright would they continue that and she can complete and be a teacher while you are married\nTo ask but really I think it would yeah yeah\nOkay that's good so you could go ahead and get married and you'd have her part time income and you're thirty five thousand dollar income knowing that in a year Eighteen months she's going to be a teacher and your household incomes going to more than double you'd be making over Seventy a couple of close to eighty thousand depending on what she's teaching where she's teaching and all that kind of stuff right\nBut with a teaching certificate in Florida she'll she'll make good money\nAnd then you've got better prospects 'cause you're gonna start thinking about what you want to be when you're thirty one is for taking the steps to be that so that when you're forty one year also a better one\nAnd fifty one year rich one\n\n... that makes sense okay yes there so I think you got the stuff to get married uh but I I'm more concerned about where you're going and where you are today\nTo answer the question of are you ready for marriage and I think you are you're sharp young guy and I'm obviously she's doing she's got a great career track there so you know what I Would want you to answer for your own satisfaction I was poking at you and saying let's pretend it's her dad right but for your own satisfaction\nWhat do you want to do where you go because let me tell you if you aim at nothing you'll hit it every time\nYou'll be a thirty one year old warehouse worker and you don't want to do that there's nothing wrong with no shame and being warehouse worker but you want to be growing and evolving right yeah you want to be something better you I Want you to own the freaking we're\nOK okay you know that that's how I Would look at it and if you got all that kind of\nTalk through and so forth and then you got a game plan C I my goal was I was going to be rich and
