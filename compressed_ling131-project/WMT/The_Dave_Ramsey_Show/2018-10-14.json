I got a Nineteen sixty vet the to rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to for ... dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car with what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a whole different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing that I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do with the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin how Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off offered to about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um [noise] I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it you pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to see have for that what we have to kind of that money I had the time um [noise] we've closed all of our credit cards\nExcept for the one for the business trips because we have money you know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\n[noise] well I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover an anchor the hotel or guy who\nHad in your unit and get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're ... we came that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... the ... thing that you need to see that one time you need to pump prime the pump one time with two thousand dollars in a separate new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ... business travel\nAnd you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you back mhm ... is a little company you're taking a big risk sure yours or you're the bank or\nFor the small company that's too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some\nPoint they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write right here company that was brought up they're going to take that money from that other company and pay the bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I bet it is Thirty years of St happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you alone is up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would never do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk\nI Would say I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that I don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips and why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back mhm\nIt's only two thousand dollars right I don't ask\nMy people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person\nThis trying to feed their dogs and their kids and keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them you know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for their rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me to pay back we just pay\nFor and we give them a debit card we give them a cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit going\nGonna make yeah how ... going to make your stomach because now you're realizing there's real\nRisk there is this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] Mm\nHey guys this is James

that's\nGood okay and you're for paid for rentals and they have this one occurred um how quickly\nCouldn't you part of this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI could really meaning to it maybe to hear what's going to be three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could you know\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to talk about tonight turn off the television shut down the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people poured all along with this rental for two years is the shrimp are worth about a ... so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or going to pay no horn and we want to sell it\nBut I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing\nNo more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rental ... if the best way to do do it is to live to free the nationally live debt free\nYeah stop it yeah you got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide because I think\nYou were really doing good until we got to Home Depot and borrow money for rental and then you kinda like lost your mind for a minute\nOr so\nWhat it sounds like ... now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which ... moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it\nOr we can lean into it for two years\nAnd I have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much\nI you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot

one five million\nOkay [laughter] that would be the most of this week one would want to have ... million okay and how long did this take\nEight months [laughter] that's okay I Know there's a story and your range of income is about eight hundred grand okay [laughter] my goodness gracious ... so what in the whole world this was a bizarre bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us plus for us that we had a decent income to do for a living and all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd Tiffany ... how these two little lady awesome ... okay and so um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I I listen to your show probably for about\nEight months leading up to this and you know for me is pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's best for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we sold a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but\nWe made it through and knocked it out and so excited my\nGoodness gracious [noise] so I don't er thousand as your typical year's income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years this range between eight and one point to run\nYou know obviously slaying it wild on so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake house bring the spring\nSo the the uh the net off the lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\nOkay but the ... I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing by the force Seventy in order to reduce the yeah the other ...\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we owe about a hundred and twenty less than that okay\nAnd that but that that are\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay sure so the a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this right was done with the sale of these two properties oh yeah oh yeah\nWow yeah I Want to read it all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge when every or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to go to the lake and now and mark got me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the for Seventy one and was worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time mhm\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nHe wasn't that way on one of those ads\n[laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha or on board from the beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone what's your wired\nIt was really difficult to to give up something that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of boils down to their getting older and we have\nKnow I just wanted to go and do I want to pay back no I go to the farm and I was going to find it on Monday good at going back to the fact that it's premium off but it doesn't cost me anything and I have to pay you know\nI'm Sorry it has a cash value in it right\nDown to three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums are right now that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nExactly I chose not also or they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking I ended up getting\nYou know it's hot sorry yes my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight at the Kennedy that you know policy the rates are low\nAnd you know I Know and when you die you know what happens to those rebels in dollars\nThey're going to keep it now they are going to keep\nIt so how is this good idea there's no way this was a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those qualities are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles I'm Matt how are you\nA fabulous they thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife and I bought a home about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were I did not include the property taxes on modern association and the insurance as part of the payment to the bank I Do all of that separate way mhm\nSo my question is is are you supposed to include the H away the property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance I joy no but most people as you know we're paying that as one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent\nThere's no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house\nOr okay where they got such a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we started here about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but account twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than a day off and then we are looking actually refinance your hair long one that\nCan ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen minute will pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other bad but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a\nSix thousand dollar income take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment wondering why they're broke you know Hitler the whole\nThe whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the ah in our senior splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I Am saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're twenty five point five percent oh God you're gonna messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be\nHouse for that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not fun to numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in Jackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay I'll just start off really quick I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that I or twenty five thousand a day or that's including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house for to save up and buy\n'em or at least save up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet save up\nHis continue continue continued on sweets complete every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused you you you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house\nNo add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based\nLiving in worth um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy now um what what size edition what'd\nYou do how much money would you spend on the addition\nI Would want to spend about twenty grand just to add on an expert brown and check on kids I work with children and that's\nGood and so the homes in your neighborhood on your street and then the next street over several for what price range\nThey sell for about a between seven eight ten Ninety on the Upper East side of my neighbor had just because it's a really small street ... pretty nice houses I mean they're they're they're pretty darn nice and like my ... my part is a\nModel and as somebody looking for a house that's worth Ninety thousand dollars it wouldn't be unusual for them to be on your street\nRight but you wouldn't want you want to come on your street to look for a hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nRight okay so don't put more than twenty into it cause Seventy plus twenty is Ninety and in order to be able to get your money back out you don't want to over build the neighborhood okay right so yeah and yes we're going to pay cash for the addition and what's your household income\nUh it's about five thousand and my mortgage is about four hundred dollars\nYeah and your mortgage and all your debt is only twenty five thousand right\nRight yeah and where you are and how much\nOf that his mortgage and how much of that other debt\nAh there's only three thousand in ... and then there's twenty two and a mortgage\nAnd you're making like Seventy thousand dollars a year right household income All right well and so how quickly could you come up with forty five thousand dollars to be dead for a you have the twenty to do the ...\nWell I I I Can't think of myself but I Know that we plan on eliminating the access that like a sex line yeah and then we're going to kick off and start paying about falling out plus I'm an extra fall now between alone with my\nFamily actually felt my eggs if it takes two years from today are here to be debt free and you have the ... edition done and you've paid cash for the addition is that okay\nUm well I mean that's

have the addition completed and paid cash for and you're a hundred percent debt free and it's two years from today is that an okay plan\nI think so because I I honestly lover I led good and and\nYou can do that because that's too that's twenty two thousand dollars a year out of Seventy thousand and you paid off everything house and everything and you pay cash for your addition you ought to be able to do\nAll of that within two years so I think you've got a great plan I Would become that free and then I Would save up an add on to my house so more than twenty thousand I'd sure you get

loan\nUnless her she writes refinanced about um two years ago I Would imagine that it's not very high\nIt's reasonable so it so it's reasonable to show you could get a mortgage that was a version more rate and payment when you get ready to purchase it after you get out of baby step to and get your emergency fund on embed be stripped three but it's going to get a little while to do that a little bit longer because you're eight hundred bucks it's ten thousand dollars a year more to live there\nRight [noise]\nWell I don't know if I Would do it or just because of emotions um but this was not a bad\nThing you're just a renter here's your worst case scenario you're a renter you've sold your house you're renting your mother in law's house and you realize you can't afford it and so then your mother in law will do what she would have done if you say no now and she will sell the house and you will have to move\nBecause we usually know mal she needs to just sell the house right\nRight yeah thank God so you could try it and say no later no harm no foul okay\nYou don't have to be ... you don't want to sign a contract to be obligated as we're going to go into Iran try it we're going to rent it for the payment and we want a written contract that we're renting it for the payment or brothers or sisters anywhere\n[noise] um there is a brother\nIn and get on a body going to be pissed off about the fact you're getting all this like would've given to you\nKnow you sure\nAs far as I understand it now there\nYeah I think we're all having coffee in one big pollen talking about this this is

for the mortgage balance\nOkay Lisa for the payment was an option to purchase it for the mortgage balance and then just like you or rent or somewhere else and you decided you couldn't stay than she would just show it then and that's no different than her selling it now accept it may have gone up a little bit in value and she might get a little more money out of it\nYeah it doesn't hurt to give this a try the only thing it hurts is eight hundred bucks a month more rent but it's if\nThere's if this was a place you see yourself living for many many many years like the rest of your life maybe\nI'm probably given Iran at this and partly because of the emotion here emotions okay\nPersonal finances personal and that doesn't mean it's situational a ethical or that the truth changes it just means you look at it and you go to them that item\nYou know that the car sitting in the driveway I rebuilt it from the time I was Thirteen to the time I was Nineteen when my dad and he died two years later I'm not so in that car\nThat car sitting in the driveway I bought a three weeks ago when I was stupid and smoking crack when I bought the car I'm selling that car\nThere's a difference in

headed for divorce so we have a huge family we have six kids between the two\nOf us feel a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and\nJust both of us spend money like crazy and and\nWere paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were I left the house to\nTo our youngest child and ... and ...\nA friend of mine invited me on to see you and me were\nI totally make over events and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him I said sure I'll go see you and I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or email policy of and a free and yes uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just ask them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nUm it just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized OK I'm the problem and and\nThen I had to do something to to get all that out and fix myself so I went home and I begged him to give it a shot and I bought your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey than\nThere were ... were retook the Thirteen week a few class at our church we started back to church or else along separation from being regular tenders and went through a marriage recovery program and we just go to a really awesome church church has a\nSteady church to ask what city church ... yeah I think it was it was God just working and our lives from the moment you know forever but really from the ... we started this plan it just everything started\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage debt in a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside and it wasn't nailed down in our house and I mean when\nThe show which flipped with you too it flipped doesn't it yes [laughter] he went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over to wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's so true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... your classes and then we just got together and nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese everything\n[laughter] ... we're going out to dinner tonight at a fairly extravagance is good and we're stressed out good no I just ... days but we've we've stayed plugged\nInto it and just never never given up I mean we we had the opportunity to leave your classes at our church and we now leader to two separate campuses and we worked with just dozens of families in Homer\nA manufactured home we pay cash for it I'm In the block he was like six hundred Ninety and mocked which seem to be high\nBut this was just supposed to be temporary so fast forward to today we are in contracted by home up in ... Colorado and we had an offer in our house for cash all cash offer\nWe're supposed to hold on our home this very day by that he won and then next Thursday when this why\nWell apparently or wheelchair did not stress to the buyers how he needed to put in the residential application\nTo assure the kid mom and buying a house for him does not have a job\nSo he probably on the verge of being disqualified combined is home\nAnd were freaking out because we took on Monday at sixty day loan out of my husband's IRA because it's kind of\nWanted you to do that\n[laughter] well yeah that's exactly what they said to myself all night because we just thought it would just it was just going to be temporary transaction oh I put it back in right away and no penalty each\nDay how close on your do you\nKnow would still be on Thursday and what happens if you don't close on Thursday\nI Know what we're being told if we had the option to put a three percent down to recast as soon as we sell our house and I wanted to know what you felt about these re casting of alone what\nIf you don't ...\nI guess to do the deal is going to be have backup office already and this other home\nOkay so ... this was a knock the manufactured home this is a homeowner\nYes you know the manufacturing home actually standing to make a ten to twelve thousand dollars\nYou know how much of a much of an earth my trick that you put down\nWe put three thousand down\nAnd you probably gonna lose that if you don't close right and and what does your recovery contingency on the sale of your other phone\nNo they would not allow and it continues out here a house gets would fit and almost sold by the end of the day\nYou know I'm you know so muggy along market you know so I'm armed here's what you're doing you're getting desperate and every time I get desperate to get stupid and you're about either and you need to not close on this house Thursday\nLet it go is okay and that's what I'm telling myself in town a husband at work and all the house to house\nAnd and you know we feel like we're getting throwing away her Ninety dollars a month does\nYour your might be but it's just a house six hundred and Ninety dollars major problem we're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back and I worked for two years you're up a creek\nAnd live our houses\nHere in any any um Longmont, Colorado we're seeing manufactured home\nIn Long Beach the manufactured home that didn't that the kids not closing on\nYeah his mom oh okay not a lot of it all cash deal okay\nAnd we just found out yesterday for our realtor which he assured is the kid had already put this application for weeks ago when we put the offer an for her and we just found out he didn't you\nJust need to sit there and you're manufacturing home manufactured home until you get at show when you get it sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchased and me and if that means you rent for a little while in between major rent for a little while in between jobs you know what to houses\nYeah I Know don't worry I needed to be honest I\nDon't do a ... an hour before brother appreciate\nThat but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does she do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nUntil my husband let's say we don't have any interest to house and you know it's just how do you remember when\nYou remember how your heart so big an open when you move to Colorado and you're going to try new adventure\nI Know everybody call of\nThe same as the opposite of that I Know you're already like it's in a cage\nAt it but yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now in Iraq or healing but yet\nYou know why you feel more honored is cause your corner 'cause I'm Wondering what the court so here's what you do when you're cornered you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYep I did that last night I walked out my husband was talking to the real fear I said I Can't even listen to the city\nI as a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a boy\nAnd I know I mean I won't go visit Neal I'll be happy to close on this deal when my trailer cells [noise] yeah when\nMy trailer is so much either has a so I Can't close until that happens and so after you guys have dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to the next guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver you'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate as soon as you feel forced [noise]\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you shouldn't clothes on\nThey should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it one 'cause you're just not gonna close\nIs if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up owning both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem\nIt's going to damage your finances is going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're going to have the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can and we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI'm I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday and then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk that's exactly what I Do calm down [noise]\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you for your service or thank you how can I help\nLike sixty and I have six little properties three that are free and clear and three that small mortgages and I just always say that we would probably to sell one of the time or basically about now that's starting now and and that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute you ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make for a year before they uh\nThey like you and he says wait a minute that on long held investment I don't know that that applies\nTo upset her hat and I think they are but I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with him I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security is not that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWhere they're profitable and yeah we've we've ... I guess you'd say thinks that's all it but they're not uh you know there is written butter ran three bedroom one bath how the\n... list I rented it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] uh yeah yeah but it was you know you know rich period I mean when you're sixteen fifty five on the senior though I've saying you've been through with Reuters and\nIf you don't want foreigners that's a different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security ...\nI may or may not cause they're so scared a problem and may be passive income might not come up with Social Security maybe you might wanna sell 'em anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mess with it [noise] that's that's a good investment and this is that\nI\nIs linked competency production officer for the ... show\nMissing days classic facial expressions and some of those\nTo make sure you want to live just been Dave

folks you brought with your the ... of their names and I just\nWe got there and who is eight and Harper who's seven\nAll right good looking family very cool and all the way across the United states here to Nashville through your debt free scream\nYou bet I love it how much of your fight off right about six nine thousand good for you and how long did that take close to nine months wow that's fast range of income right about a hundred and fifty thousand what are you guys do for a living so I'm In a ... minute sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness coach\nOkay very good and what kind of that was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left cool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off\nNo we just pay them off car got us into the travel\nOkay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch flip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right I'm going out and we decided to ban for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we want and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was in we are just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though they can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we won were more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future so we just we went ... intensity and your term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like I said we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ration center and so we uh\nGot that started writing\nOf time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and we did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's ... you can attend that might be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from what drew me to it because they believe in modeling all the eight years and if I was going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model it myself\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Moore's caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean you know Margot knows you know that's what happened but it's happened on this show and you're much [laughter]\nSo well done you guys very well done so when you have someone in your class and\nThey show up for financial peace and they're not game on because

need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do it yeah and you start your hands\nStart waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too
