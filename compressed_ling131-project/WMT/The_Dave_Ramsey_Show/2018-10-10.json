O. break\n... and can't we have an attitude that\nOne being our mortgage and then the second being our car ... and and the happening whites\nAnd feels that that money should go towards the car and I am just\nLeaving it as a little bit more sentimental and wanting to go toward something a little bit more sentimental and I'm Wondering is that correct it kind of you with their money and it's kind of like a final gas can shake it can take away the emotions can just go towards fat\nSo you want to buy something with it\nWell yeah it's like I'm eating a new as as sweet as an appliance his own line of kind of been around for way too long and it was hardly working in the first place and my grandmother and when that taught me how to cut ... for me that would be kind of a more final gift\nI guess I Would say that he might have been if I have we have the extra money toward a car I get that pay down\nOkay how much money's involved\nAt ... right\nUm\nWell I analyze these things through sentimental limbs as well and the way I Would ask myself this is okay grandma was obviously good\nWith their money is is that she left her grandkid and kids nine thousand bucks okay mhm um show grandma sitting in heaven looking at a grandbaby\nWhat makes her smile because her granddaughter did this with the money and I'm not thinking a dishwasher does that\n[laughter]\nNow I get the tie in to she taught you to cook and I might take a thousand dollars and buy some cooking utensils so that every time I used that set of\nPots and pans or knives or whatever that I thought a grandma and I'm like what the rest of it on my car but I think grandma probably with somebody that hated debt and she might be smiling have you paid off the debt I gotta agree with your husband\nOkay um but it's not that I'm not doing that through the lens of I'm calling your sentiments silly\nI'm just laying so I'm I'm just saying you're sentiment you can actually use that to try to say okay this is a you know the the character of this woman she was a frugal person of saving person she was careful with their money my guess is she hated debt\n... does that sound familiar I mean\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah\nSee I fail they paid off all data lounge real estate and made it at pretty much as their retirement\nYou know so I mean I think she'd be smiling it'd be paid off your car but also think she'll be smiley if you spent you know a grand on some stuff to using the kitchen I get to enlist balances out a little bit I'm actually on the car\nAt same time that I think twenty four twenty five\nThousand dollars or something I ... what's your household they wouldn't pay it off you get ... what's your household income\n[noise] a white editor added sugars here\nOkay All right well it's all going to get taken care of British in

through the lens of what what is wise and that would also be pleasing to grandma and so I probably would buy you know I'd probably say Sharon let's go get a really high end amazing set of\nCooking pots and pans and knobs or whatever drop a grand on it I don't know something like that uh-huh and then let's throw the rest of it at this in honor of grandmother because I think she'd be smiling about both things\nI think you're you know you're honoring life or tradition the way she saw it and believed and that is something\nYou do whatever you want or let's just the way I think through

this coaching thing again text the word coaching to thirty three seven eighty nine Robert's with us in Atlanta Hi Robert welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHigh bay thanks for having me on sure what's up a one\nTo ask you I'm retired I Am still work full time so I have a double dip you have a actually a lot of small Carlin besides my retirement for them to come for Medicare I mean Social Security ... next February\nAnd was thinking at sixty six hours ... bad and try to reinvest uh any gross more\nA cushion for my wife who is younger than me I think I've got enough money to live on but I Want to help her out a little bit cause she got a\nKind of a bad early retirement contributions to marry a ...\nA car and we both putting end the maximum all that we can and color retirement story employment mhm so am I actually had a twenty four or five apiece starting this year so I'm Wondering what you thought about taking Social Security is sixty six\nNo problem at all especially will turn around and reinvest it\nWell we'll we'll have to pay for the taxes on it sounds really don't qualify for all but oh well I think we still put me on a regular All right\nWell you would qualify for a Roth if you continue to earn at least five thousand dollars a year\nA well I Am a misunderstanding or there's an upper income limit on there\nOh there is yeah yeah you can do not make over two hundred thousand dollar household income do you\nDo\nOkay All right then you can do what's called a back door Roth I'd do that every year I might considerably more than two hundred thousand and the back door off is a at over fifty I'm over fifty year over fifty we can put in sixty five hundred each six thousand five hundred each if we want to\nI'm into I put it into good gross stock mutual funds for me and for my wife saw Thirteen thousand dollars each January I Move into a what's your does your move it into a ... and after about four Tom sorry how before tax\nIRA traditional i._r._a. because that why you haven't had taxes taken out on it\nYou didn't take a tax deduction and then you roll it to her off instantaneously and all in the same trends are action it's called a back door Roth IRA I talk to your broker about it if you don't have one ... one of our smart best her prose can show you how to do that but that that's the rough the IRA issue but you can invest your Social Security money\nWhether you do a Roth or not you just put it in a mutual fund but if you're going to just take and spend it I mean you can do that too but you don't need the money you got plenty of money so I mean yeah I Would go ahead and begin to draw it\nBecause I'm you know the the faster you take it out when you turn around and reinvest it the more you're going to end up with a more than you would have and the difference in what it pays you by waiting\nUm so the only difference is if somebody's just consuming it\nAnd you're nowhere near that uh then you might run the calculation differently but if you're a poet and invest it answers always pull it as soon as possible and start investing it because you're going to end up with more alive and more dead by doing that a\nIs with us in Austin, Texas how can we help today\n[noise] hey Dave hey what's up for taking my call sure me to ask you ask them should refinance our home ticket at it that you know [noise]\nNot unless it's to avoid

of been existing and you're starting to feel like a rat in the wheel and you're looking for a way to get off the wheel and you just selected the wrong way to get off\nOkay\nBorrowing your way out of

the total money make over I'll show you how to do this but you got to do some ... some you got to get really really serious and you're going to have to like you know cuts for stuff out and get this debt cleaned up\nAnd the way you get it cleaned up to pay it off and they may or may not mean you sell a car a but it for sure means you're not going on vacation for a while and you don't need to send

I did you do a lot of fun so something happened\nAnd you're all lived three years and five months ago when a switch flip tell me what happened\nSo a great story but it started five years ago today when we got married or are you good two months after that we decided to buy a house and our debt went from about two hundred and fifty to three hundred and two thousand dollars ... and uh\nWe started on our own path not sharing the debt I was to pay off what I owed and she was to pay off her part mhm and now I made a really brilliant decision and I bought a flu on a credit card oh good three hundred dollar\nHuge money argument that wasn't an argument was an ultimatum well he said I'm not doing this again\nThis is a second marriage for both of us and now she had money problems before with her previous mhm and wasn't going to do it again so I said I don't know how to do it but I Know a guy who does\nAnd I let her over to the podcast and that started I wrote\nWhoa very cool very funny shows the flu to broke the camel's back\nUp the aisle and\nYour daughters from his first marriage and ah she the oldest is going to start band and he went home charged it and I thought\nWhat okay oh no well it's it's you know that's\nGood you should you know buying your daughter a flute and that even makes more sense [laughter] wow I just didn't so you play in the ...\nAbout the firefighter the flu guy but yeah okay whatever [laughter]\nAll right good oh fun very fun you guys OK so yeah you did look up and you realize last time a one lady told me she said my starter husband the first one [laughter]\nShe said that time I figured out\nThat this doesn't work and I'm not doing this again that's a good line that I've had it you had an I've had it moment and are they all said okay I'm with you I've had it to let's fix this so it wasn't a I'm\nA ... this long drawn out argument but it was kind of just hit the balls with no okay look just wait we've got two ways that were there was a way that works in a way that doesn't work why we're doing it doesn't work\nExactly yeah well and I had never really heard of before and I didn't even know how to use a pot cafes even know what a pod cast was and so when Dale charge the flute at the time we kept our finances separate mhm and ice we're getting ready to go on a\nVacation Italy ... and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt mhm so we cancel that\nBowl and I went on a yoga retreat on my own ... and part of that retreat\nWas four hours of meditation and I listen to your [laughter]\nAnd I came back and said okay I'm ready to know that that that want to work where you can do that guy okay and so then you got the books are financial peace university or water just listen to the ... um mostly we listen to the pot and that's good then we got the book and then we've let 'em as to you oh okay so I did all\nAll unfold after all a very good oh good for you guys well congratulations to you how's it feel to have no payments in\nThe world amazing it's hard to describe yeah and in your office case it also removed this monster in the closet that might bust out at any time and stuff on your marriage yes you know and we're just that's not there anymore ... gone\nBecause of the properties are actually owned by the ... you the items are owned by the trust if you don't do that and the trust has no benefit that's called funding the trust re titled ... everything you own end of the name of the trust which is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that are formed a number of fun to many people pay their stupid lawyer or financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build the trust and then they never retired all the stuff in the name of trust which means the trust of absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's a ... no value so I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living trust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and show no I Would not build trust now you can set up and you can have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor I trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your death of money both of you die and you're minor children the money goes into a trust and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second mothers that are I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed and no trust happening\nUnless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age\nThey're no longer legally children\nEmotionally either for that matter but there we go so I mean some of your children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty years old when he did for a living he said I'm a stay at home son I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what your butt in the street [laughter] my Swiss Mike's in Chicago [laughter] Hey Mike how are you I'm good\nAre you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a ton of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bills that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdraw and they stopped taking out and they've since my\nAccount to collections and then to a lawyer and refinance filming to court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are all if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do much is on that bill a Fifteen sixty one thousand five hundred and sixty okay\nAnd what's your household income or about Seventy five thousand dollars for them and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of\nCredit card as well student loan so what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm [noise] and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming show how we get a dollar and a three and what were the medical issues\nOr she has what's called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\n\nOkay you gotta do you guys are at a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got you know ever since she was ... actually have a lot of things going on\nAnd how much credit card that do you have a lawyer\nProbably at twenty five thousand dollars mhm\nAnd how much didn't want him to do\nThat one up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's the doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stay at home mom\nHuh All right\nUm well what normally happens\nIf you have a heart and you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's ... that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad in a good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right [noise] yeah\nSo as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship to furrow\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars and offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nOkay because we called today a ... federally call today at least that you know we ... what can we do and they just said\nUm you have to pay the full amount plugged in court fees and attorney feed them or hire a lawyer and when the when court okay\nYou're going to come back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and then you\nHave you keep messing with the national weather and messing with them\nBecause they're gonna listen you are dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even to another paralegal\nYou're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a widget in a factory this is your life at your daughter is the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page they talked to ... stop thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that yeah talking to your head when you're talking to the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nLike a movie okay and just to keep that amount and just keep going well I don't have that so does that computer for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and it may go into court are you taking me to court doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you're going to have every bit of that\nAnd if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement in full no I Will not give it to you as a partial payment to get started no I'm not going to put this on payments that hasn't worked for me and it hasn't worked for you but I Will settle this with you\nFor pennies on the dollar and you're going to be lucky to get that because I got so much debt coming out my ears from this little girl that I'm pretty sick or you people and I'm thinking about filing bankruptcy and given use zero anyway\nAnd you are having these conversations with these idiots okay now you legitimately owed them money so we got to work with them but you know you just keep it all ended up\nIts ... ended up going to court\nIt ended up going to court then they will take a judgment against you you don't need an attorney you're going to lose okay because you all the money and they want him before the judge and the judge says might deal with the money and you say yes and he goes guilty\nRight over it as a matter if we tell them you know my daughter ... hair I don't ... I don't care if the industrial side of the medical world\nThey don't care I'm Sorry I Wish they did but they don't and so I just try to satellites and then let's put together a system that worked out of this whole mess and I'll help you put together the whole system and financial beach university and I'm going to put you through that for free you and your wife are going to get\nYour arms around the money thing so you put yourself in a position of strength to walk through the rest of the things you and you're you're lumped in with his daughter because you've got to find that with you you got dish will will with you hold on this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now buried on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you had to Dave Ramsey dot com slash shown\n[noise]\n\nDid you know that fifty\nSix percent of homeowners are over paying for their insurance and one in three drivers is doing the same thing that means there's a pretty good chance your spending more than you have to\nOwn insurance and folks just because you're paying a lot of money doesn't mean you have the coverage that you really need when you work with an independent insurance agent you get access to dozens of insurance carriers through one person that\nMeans lots of policy options and little work on your part our doors to local providers are independent agents who will find the policy that works best for you it doesn't take long to get a quote\nAnd you could save hundreds sounds like a no brainer to me go to Dave Ramsey dot com defined the insurance E.

set of a skills\nIt really has only one application in your city and you lost that job okay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to sell 'em\nAshton Martin ... or ... you would be in a similar market and the the\nDownside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on them because of the curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closed the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in order to create repeat business\nYou are an expert in there\nAnd I think that's set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree\nOr I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine I was I just came I went to something with wheels on it because you had some what wheels or the motor before slow your mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but you know I talked to a guy though that is selling the crud outta high on cars\nAnd he used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's just similar skill set because he was dealing with high in the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people you're dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\n[noise] and I think if you think if you broaden that out that why do you have you back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that and I think you're going to be fine so I wouldn't panic I'm\nThe only thing I could think of is if you can kind of some kind of brokerage situation where you're brokering high end luxury RVs um for two hundred and fifty grand you can fly in and out of a city ever so often and make a deal happen\nAnd so I mean you could go straight to manufacture or to a dealer of the same brand that fired you but it's been a much larger metropolitan area and sell to people\nAll over the nation and hand hold their hands in the process with a broker process I'm done I'm not sure where the leads come from not sure how that deal happens but um when you're dealing with something as two or three hundred thousand dollars airplane tickets are cheap\nAnd that makes that deal happened can't do that when you're making thirty five thousand but in your situation you there's a lot of stuff you can do um I mean you could be gone one night a week and jump around and really close some big deals you could sell a jets private jets\nThat's another thing that would fit perfectly in your scenario um and the job market's pretty hot right now because the economy's booming\nCouldn't give a jet away two years ago and now you can't find one show um it you know that's another place you that you think of a luxury mechanical element that's all I'm doing
