okay\nNot okay at all Amy is with us in Akron, Ohio Hi Amy welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up\nWhile I Am kind of the issues going on my um my father in law recently had a stroke and um and so he has been in a nursing home for about a month and a half ...\nUm my husband and I are on baby steps sex so we're actually thinking of looking into buying a new house\nThat might have an in law suite so we had maybe do home care at our house with him um we're just trying to figure out what would be better financially efficient half our house now which we owe about um Ninety thousand on or buy a house\nThe one that we kind of we're looking at on a fellow at like um like around three hundred\nAnd what's her current home worse um it's\nProbably like one fifty\nOkay so you can move up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house that the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house within the next few years anyway what's\nYour ... um it's about two hundred and fifty dollars a day\nOr you can afford it if you put it on a Fifteen year fixed or less All right I'd prefer to live because they don't want you every time you only get paid all start Fifteen Years over again that kind of guy each the purpose right right purpose would be to become that free so is he financially I'm obviously not able to care for himself obviously there is no other family members\nUm my husband has a brother um we're kind of a better situation I guess to to take something like\nThat on um ... my father in law does have a pretty he has a decent amount of money so he um he he could keep them in a nursing home for a little while until the money runs out stress for well\nI mean you may want to sit down um you see capable of making decisions with the stroke\nIs yeah I think they're um mentally and physically had\nHow much money when you say he's got a fair amount of money\nUm he's probably got like three hundred thousand [noise]\nOkay well I mean you could make a deal with him that if you've got your half of the inheritance prior to his death that you would agree to care for him until his death\nAnd go and get your one fifty and then you go about pay cash for theirselves yeah okay and you know\nYou would want to clear that with a brother as well everybody needs to be paid just as a kind of stuff this was a law\nSo you're real careful with it and go okay you're still going to get your buddy but we're now or is now you know and we're going to care for him and we'll take care of him a but that's a heavy commitment on your old part right and in other words if I were in your shoes the way I Would want to analyze that would be\nIf you reach a point being at home and your husband's at work and you don't want to do this care that you guys would be willing to write the check for the in home care nurse\nMhm yeah I um I think that we'd probably still need a nurse to come in\nTo some of it is good that's good\nWell I mean you can decide how you want to do this but that's one way you could put some of the money together\nAnd not having a little complicated thing where he owns house to house and then you have to deal with your brother in law when he dies casino range half your house or half half of your house or some kind of crap like that I don't want to get in right that that's that's a nightmare\nBut you can just bought a house and go we make two hundred fifty thousand we can afford it\nAnd we're gonna put on Fifteen year and\nYou know he can use this hundred and fifty to buy the in home care um however you want to do it that's the way to do it there's nothing wrong with that I Would have in my mind you know just your exit strategy is being you know if he gets really in bad shape and you have to put him in a nursing home are we going to handle that\nAnd then number two we got to get\nIn law and everybody needs to be on board on this everybody's got to feel good about this we met in person meeting was that sitting there telling

with us in Hawaii are I'm Sorry ... Hawaii I'll get all these out a Hi Connie how are you\nGood thank you very much for taking my call sure how can I help\nI'm Wondering what advice do you have to make it in a place where the cost of housing so astronomical\nYou have to make an astronomical income right because you don't get a pass on math\nIf you live in Hawaii California or Manhattan math is still math and so if you buy something you can't afford it will still bankrupt you write\nRight shoulder you know ...\nOr so the problem and the problem is dramatic\nAh for a guy like you who probably is a a a native Hawaiian and probably your grandfather and grandmother were and uh it's all you've ever known and yet the housing prices on the islands have made it where a regular working men can hardly afford to live there\nYeah\nIt's like Silicon Valley right I mean you can't afford to let you can afford to work in Silicon valley but you can't afford to live there you have to live the forty five miles away and hour and a half commute to be able to afford a house their problem is you can't move that far out 'cause you have this thing called an ocean [laughter]\nCan't\nMove that far out of town and it gets wet yeah but I I don't know I mean are there areas I Know why who in Maui and of course the big islands got its own issues right now but a little volcano action but the uh I Know a lot who in Mali are outrageous are the other islands\nI think I think so I mean I think I Would probably have pockets of places that you know somebody could um afford a but the problem is typically like you said it's like an\nHour and a half of your even though we're on an island and you got to drive\nFifteen or twenty miles with the worst tropic of the nation\nIt's up to two lane road it's a beautiful view but you get to enjoy the view yeah right\nOr the neighborhood is not you know you might not necessarily want to raise your kids are\nRight right okay so there is some options along those lines um then I you know there's not a magic answer to it what I don't want you to do and that's why I started the answer the way I started to what I don't want them to do is just give yourself permission to do something that's harmful to you\nJust because it just because it's expensive and you throw up your hands go well just the way it is and they rooms or just doesn't understand was not me it's math math still a problem when your house payment is sixty percent of your take home pay because real estate's expensive\nYou're going to go bankrupt I mean you're not going to make it your kids aren't going to college are going to struggle financially you're gonna struggle you can't keep that from happening and so you've got to uh you gotta you gotta bite the bullet into a neighborhood you don't love a commute you don't love or make some other arrangements um\nOr honestly truthfully what happens is uh are you Silicon Valley as an example of just reading an article about the other day the number of people that have left\nIs absolutely amazing 'cause they just yeah and then they're having the bus they're bussing service workers in\nBecause they can't afford to live there all by some in and you know some of the ski resorts face the same thing they build housing for the workers because it's the only way they can get somebody to stay there because you can't afford to live in Aspen\nAnd work in Aspen as a as a ... you know as a ski patrol guy right you can't afford to expand right and so it's the same kind of an economic issue on these micro ... economic situations but no you cannot it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan and make less than a hundred grand\nYou're right it just meant Iraq medically very tough and so you end up cross in one of the bridges I'm ... and living out in one of the other boroughs um in in order to get your costs down enough to actually survive and live your dream of being there\nSo I'm hopefully you can find a way to you know mix in the neighborhood idea and the commute idea\nEnough to get a value that works what do you do for a living\nAnd I'm a firefighter okay while as a part time I'm a flight attendant\nOkay cool and are you married yes what's your wife do\nRight now she pretty much stayed at home with a kid\nHow many kids I'm too We're two under two all fun and what's your household income\nYeah [noise] I'm about five thousand a month a home on average\nTheir town of fluctuates on my part time job kind of fluctuate depending on how much are you know work at a\nLow for a firefighter have you got a lot of stuff coming out of your check\n'em on a really ... well\nI think my deductions about thirty percent below\n... I mean do you have other junk like insurances are something coming out of your check um no I don't know I think well what\nIt was a major city and so I'm just as long as you're not exactly in a rural environment here so I was just guessing I didn't know right uh I I run into firefighters make a hundred all over the place so um\nOh yeah not in in in Hawaii via a captain ... which is a yeah most of the way probably could be yeah\nAll right uh and you are you in are you doing three days on for all for that kind of a routine\nYeah three days every other day and then or yeah or\nYou know I might instead of being a flight attendant I might look at a part time a business on the side you might make more than that than on the flight attendants stuff\nA\nLot of firefighter guys I Know have great side hustles that they make almost as much as they do it's far off and they're really fabulous they get in the in construction business the painting business or something like that and they make really seriously good money but hey man I don't I Try to help you all I can I put you guys into financial ... university the one year memberships that includes\nThe nine lessons in a glass hold on

peace Christ Jesus guy\nJust constantly production officer for the ... this hour is on and you'll find more on her YouTube channel where we have over six million people use each month\n... green millionaire our lives have France is so much more go check it out\n... people that look for two hundred and Ninety in three hundred thousand dollar houses don't drive down your street\nRight okay so when you price when you have a house is worth two Seventy five and you spend Fifteen more on it that's two Ninety and that's so you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption it's like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise] but the likelihood is\nIf you told me your house was worth two thirty and or the average house prices to fifty five and you spent two hundred and Fifteen on it and then you would be like up to average and you would likely get your money out depending on what\nYou spent the money on what the repairs were or the re models were I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get it's going to increase the value of your home 'cause it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n... trauma what's up [noise]\nGot a question just started listening to your pod cast a my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while but uh we start listening to you and go through financial peace and my wife and are planning to do that I'm just finally got her on board with everything [laughter]\nUm my question is just started budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance ... uh or peace right um so my my paid\nChanges all the ... one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand sure how ... how do you have a budget without Dave ...\nConceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk through and a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay what's our worst month and the next coming twelve likely it sounds like yours is five K. very like it's very very likely you're not going to be below five K. in the coming twelfth grade\nAgree okay they might but it'd be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars on name on assignment of mission and show five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do or it might be want to save some money it might be want to go on a trip it might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably it's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of those\nThings and we say art after our regular budget if we make a dollar what is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYet they're okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife or look at that and you're saying that's number one\n[noise] [noise] okay you say are we ... we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing the ... this month to do that to be for the rest of your life it's just but this coming up\nAnd you put it to beside that and then a three and then a four and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical

married and something happened and boom we're on this three year journey almost from the honeymoon on to get to get that free ride yet what happened does your story\nA well like most stories asserts at the bachelor party\n[laughter] no\nMy best friend Brad who had been friends with since I was four we finished watching the hockey game going out for dinner and we're standing around talking he's a cop so he's in his car all day\nAnd I said you know I'm In my car all day for work I was you know I'm getting bored and music and like is there anything else you listen to the kind of grew up the same families never talked about money or anything like that\nAnd he said you know there's this guy a Dave Ramsey I listen to these financial talks and that they're doing is or listen to that and that was about two months before we got married just after we had literally just bought our car ... off so uh\nIt's horrible timing but it was great and I listen to your guest every day for about two months and I wanted to buy your book but Brad said uh you know I'm getting that for your marriage so\nAnd that has a wedding gift card is literally we got married came back from the honeymoon and started right away and every dollar had just come out and so\nVery cool so I actually um your your fiance started listening to a podcast loses his mind [laughter] um [noise] what did you say about all this I

do you to tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nI Would say that budget in just telling your money where to go ... and making it the way you want it to the onset of it saying you have to pay

latest avenger is yeah right yeah it's the murder rate so Chris\nWhat about you what is your key to getting out of debt what do you tell people the budget and what else\nIs probably the like that being intentional with your money I think all my life I just knew how to make money and spend it [laughter] and then also what the budget and just your plan I was like man this is crazy crazy how how much life can change\nI go like it's it's just insane I married the first time we ever did or budget thinking we make a ton of money [laughter] this is I did not think we made this much and we could do this ... yeah it does\nGive you hope done at the podium you sit down and you kind of have that moment feel like I got a raise I Know this for\nYears and now we're like we're on we just started step

the time and I was pretty amazing very cool so how did you tell a lot of people you're doing this or you're a quiet about it\nFor the ... the first one is like I was so bad with money growing up for the first month or like a year maybe kind of kept it just with a ... and then after that my sister who's also here\nShe kind of started asking me questions to she knew I was with money going you know what are you doing it I'd give her all your books because we think the whole library mhm so but ah and then slowly told my mom and dad and\nWe got her finger dire later then I Would say his sister and then I'm rabidly and who told us about you John biggest cheerleader\nIn a way that well where you get to enjoy being at work because you spend a lot of time at work\nYou know and you should\nYou should get something out of it other than just money and Ken's got a show you how to do that good good stuff exciting times you guys are so if you want to come Kansas City it's all day long the tickets are so stinking cheap you would pay the ticket price to see any one of those speakers and there's like what eight of us or something I mean it's a\nIt's all number one best selling author is all top flight world class communicators it's the best the best sucking all star team that's pretty cool\nLaura's with us in Houston, Texas Hi Laura welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I'm I have a question about fitness trophy you're going to have your theory ... twenty five years old I'm and I'm\nI was offered to buy a bit last\nI ... I just think there are a lot and I have come back after I left that they you know apple pie\nAnd all that I Would have to go I think that for a bad year for six hundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the table at a temperature down fat and now I can also find my own age for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash\nCash so that whole thing um but I'm just wondering if that sort of thing but it's just better to buy a rather they start out because I Know how it started out that they feel like they don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business failure is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail that don't take care of their tax bill and they get by on on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ... if you go into debt\nAnd do this and I have to tell ya I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years of doing the show advise anyone to go into debt to buy a business ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill wasn't all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nCan ... fairly easily actually does you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate and I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you are running this thing after you pay you a salary\nCap for what I haven't got you know can\nYou would make three hundred ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit I don't have access to the book yeah profit\nAfter after the rent is paid the secretary is paid every body I paint\nAt their payroll after ... after ... after insurance I don't know\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA life that we can check it gave out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back not drink at your ten oh\nOkay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like there in about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal right so they're not ripping you off on the price [laughter] ah but I Would not go into to do it I Would start your own\nOkay and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could say about the money and do that is if you are making two ten enter every three years you could save up and buy a business it's worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies\nAre by buying out other stand alone but I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older but I was fifty voters or personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and with all the bumps and bruises along the way I've been really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\nHigh today and it's like if they quaking you to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am trying to not have a law with getting his credit report repaired and claimed that he's currently deployed in the military and Kuwait\nAnd um he had found a bad back on and a collection agency has taken that we're dealing with one time and we offer they sat on the line at settlement now what they had on my later\nThey responded and had great ... offer and they sent me back a form letter that get fed one time selling off I only have a great shadow which you put it that amount we had asked for some more stimulation like\nCan you can leave them behind a face your not going to fail there for ... party\nNo longer says ... also says settled in full and they're the owner of the day you're fine\nIf they do work to pay it out of it for a little wary of counting base these guys are kind of a full day are\nBottom feeders that's who you're dealing with are probably ... ... what kind of debt is it ...\nIt was a medical that about Hillary about three or four years old\nYou know they pay the nickel two or three cents on the dollar for it and their debt buyers and they are but there are bottom feeders you're dealing with that you're dealing with a guy to phone room they couldn't get a good job\nOf course that anything will be okay with with paint on that money and we don't have to get back\nYeah if you got it in writing and your staple a copy of the ... or the cashier's check\nTo that and you keep it the rest of your life in Casey's ... mess up their paperwork which they might and sell it and then somebody calls you later you go oh no I have a document this has settled in full I don't know a dime and if you've ever call me again I'm going to sue all of you it'll shut it down\nIf you want to double check ... I'm not an attorney but if you want to double check my advice with an attorney trauma copy the letter that's fine but I'm you're not going to get something sign that people like that there\nThat you you are a widget on a conveyor belt and you're just you know going Willie walkers chocolate factory you're just going along getting stamped that's all it is and you're not going to get much more than you got there wanting some money you're willing to give them the amount of money you got it in writing and says it settles it in full\nIt just says no more dead as do after this has settled in full as it has that phrase on it I'm fine with it if it were me I Would I Would go forward and I think you're fine but he sure you keep up the paperwork because it might come up later I mean keep the rest of your life it might be Fifteen Years it'll pop back up you never know the stuff's got to live like two and it's unbelievable\nHow about this hour that Iran's you show in the books our thanks to Jamie ... is our producer ... or especially for the phone rings Dave Ramsey your host and we will be back [noise]\n\n\nWell our typical experience has been because we don't know no one knows except for ... who runs for like a\nGreat the only ones that actually know their algorithm but it appears between six months a year from the time that you have all zero balances and no open accounts if you have a credit card and you're paying it off every month that's an open\nAccount right or that you can have no debt and still have a credit score all the time okay so if anybody is reporting on you and the only way that would happen\nIs if you have an ongoing relationship with them in and you're still all the money or you're still using their product even though you're paying it off every month that could be an M. X. card then you will always maintained a credit score of some kind so the only way as if you have ... you go off the grid basically you're saying I have a zero accounts open and zero balances of any\nKind of bad debt no good debt no no debt that I pay off every month no debt of any kind roughly\nSix months to a year later we're finding people's credit score disappears disappears now when I first started this I still had a bankruptcy showing on mine\nAnd so it was not going to go away for a while because I had this bankruptcy showing in a chapter seven bankruptcy will report on you for ten years in a sharp on your credit bureau report\nAnd some of the old creditors that you bankrupt on that you don't pay they might report after the bankruptcy they're not supposed to but sometimes they're computers kick out that they still haven't gotten paid well they're not going to get paid to shop for seven they got the route and I had two of them are three of them for three years later\nAnd that started the whole process over I had to go back and dispute those because they were not allowed to report that um they did ultimately get paid ... I went back and paid my bankruptcy but um as a moral thing not as a legal thing but anyway all that to say\nYou've got to have the thing completely squeaky clean and then apparently if they haven't changed at this month and they don't start counting your rent\nOr they didn't start counting something else that we don't know that they count then your credit score will go to zero which is what we call it but they technically call it in the terminal because they have no way to determine like credit score um you know they actually sent me an email back in the day that said um\nYou know we want to check on you\nBecause our credit score a your credit scores disappeared during ... on the terminal and um we wanted to make sure there was not a mistake or that you weren't dead um and I kind of thought that was a threat but [laughter]\n\nSo subtle passive aggressive like on a southerner says bless your heart you know I mean it's the same thing right so yeah but yeah I bet zero for gosh twenty five twenty six twenty something years something like that either interminable credit score\nAnd uh I've had an interminable amount of money as a result because I don't have any payments\nAnd it's a pretty amazing thing open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five a match in Charlotte North Carolina Hi Matt how are you\nA good day appreciate tech my column or get into my question
