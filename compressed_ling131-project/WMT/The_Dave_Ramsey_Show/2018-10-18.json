{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Well I have a I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working full time in fact most of the time she had two jobs when she lived in Aurora [noise]\nBut um [noise] had to move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area and\nShe was only able to get part time she is still making her bill [laughter] she does she does know about they ran the I I've been trying to get her into a class I Will at some point um and so she does have a car payment she's making that she's you know has room rental room she's making that [noise]\nUm but just barely as you can imagine on working at a rally as part time [laughter] so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she has five not four or five wisdom teeth in her mouth all of which have to come out and we'll be well into the thousands\nWhy or why did she move away from her income\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's crept with blown up at ... at the house I'm it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice and it was being people were in\nThere I got that burglar I had jobs right\nHe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out on the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell she couldn't find a rental in the Denver area that was within her range she felt\nYeah I don't yeah I Know so the Denver at the very very expensive rental area and so she moved somebody offered her room over in a state\nRun ... shows so she got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without our income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up a well\nI didn't have to tell you that the company she was working for promised her they were transferred to fulltime even their home so when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time there\nWe understand and so she got there and all of a sudden it with ah right now it's part time it will working full time but now it's like a ... so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was having all that got you okay fulltime\nJob of are you asking should you help her with her wisdom uh with some situation\nOh I Would yeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her with them keep situation um is there any other ideas I mean what this money what does the girl do\nShe ... yeah I Know yes job ...\nYou have to let her she made the decision should she has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennial\nThose they need to start feeling the weight of their decision if they make a bad decision mom and ground pirate grandparents sitting not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision Dave my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that cost acquaintance because he knew that's the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nThey brought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with day she needed she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying it's expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away or for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a full time you work through the things you waitress your drive over you know ... feet soon as you babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that will get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out what the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced to write\nAnd she's a victim of our circumstances she overreacted or circumstance yeah yeah and uh when you told me that that people cannot live in Denver because the rent is high on there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving your own proving yeah and um so you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not however feet solid on her but you work three four jobs and then the other thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom teeth and help her make to make the ... the Mexican turn their financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony um [noise] I have two daughters they're both doing very well eighth and ninth gave for four one K. question either want want anything to do is at their most fabulous favors and you get ...\nI'm ... I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one cave [noise]\nMy question is should I advised her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or or what are your piece or do her work ones and keep transferring them\nOr do you know for work was are matching matching her as well\nAnd and I that's the question is is you get the packets shield she ... she ... she can be there for three months you could be there for six months so but they do all we send to the retirement pay for our country and they need to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the\nRolling over every time she changes jobs\n... yeah yeah that's that's exactly right absolutely and then in addition to that on the side that the two have stability peace in their letter just a Roth IRA ratio where the smart rush for pro and then I guess right each time but you're saying she's working short stance and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one by before oh one K. someday\nShe could rights or should she each time she leaves well into their stable one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four O. one K. with you into a direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that um but that they technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers and stuff as you go along so I'm a good question I Would question\nEighteen

girlfriend but we'll see how that pans out right\nOkay and um what do you make a year\nOr about sixty right now good for you and how much debt do you have I have not\nLook at you or your great grandfather's kid that's an excellent [laughter] he's proud of that I'm sure I'm All right um how old are you\nI'm twenty three okay good good\nOkay typically what will occur in the next five years statistically speaking it's not a requirement is certainly not a law it's just an observation of the way life unfolds or you'll get married and buy a house\nTypically okay you might not you don't have to like I said it's not required I'm not saying that but the point of that being those are two major events and uh\nBoth of them will require money\nAnd so we need to keep that in mind what we're doing this we would always tell you to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses so I Want you to brown Fifteen thousand bucks or so set aside for that um\nIf you want to buy a home and pay cash for it at this stage and inexpensive home a that's not a bad thing uh I I\nI Would expect that when you get married you probably wouldn't move again and that's not unusual it's not bad it's just you kind of expect that so I'm just generally after you get married you find out you bought their own home [laughter]\nYeah I I'm anxious to buy a home my older brother is buying a home at this point but I just don't think it's right for me with you know with how accessible moving is for me and my field I Am a nurse I'm terrible at moving anywhere\nAnd you don't know how you're gonna have to then that's cool you know my point is there's no rush\nAnd I I I'm personally with you I think it'd be cool if you're white three years to buy your place in kind of quote settling on or whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency fund in place and your debt free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should always do with money\nOr you should enjoy some of it\nI'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary or you should give some of any money that you have and\nYou should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money and if I'm In\nYour shoes is going to be invested and uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're gonna leave alone at least five years\nI'm just going to buy some good mutual funds with it I invest in four types of mutual funds in my retirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer and growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred hundred and fifty of this in something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years and buy a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nUh the flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation so I Would give some I Would enjoy some and I would invest the majority of it\nAh some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple on index fun and ask them ... five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um it it's going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does and then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with\nIf you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it sits there for forty years and grows the stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started ... you're going to be so wealthy is going to be unbelievable and it's it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy sounds sit down with a smart vest or pro is what I Would tell you to do with ... dot com and drop down a list of the smart Mr pros in your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest\nAnd uh I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for buying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on believe a plea wonderfully wealthy [noise]\nUh I asked is with us in Charlotte North Carolina Hi asked them how are you\nI'm doing great how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I just recently about three months ago started that every dollar at love it I mean with the smart pro investor this sweet good or from a personal finances or operate but my question isn't on the individual ... [laughter]\nIt is on the church or non profit side of things I was curious if and your opinion or perspective ... are there a way for churches and nonprofits to invest for them financially\nWell some people call that being in Dowd a we're a university is typically a\nSituation where you would see that happen [noise] um and that's where there's a large enough sum of money\nThe investment return off of that account say out of ten million dollar endowment that had built up and that money is invested in the in investing their returns off at ten million dollars will operate the thing in perpetuation and so they let the nest egg causes of the nonprofit to live in\nPerpetuation off of that are you most often see that in a um\nA formal large a\nNonprofit or in where you really see a lot as in a university\nOr where they're in Dowling a even a professorship there's enough money in this one account that the income is providing is paying the salary of a professor in whatever field okay in someone just felt like they wanted to make sure that university was able to\nUh pay that professor in perpetuation going forward and that kind of a thing in the local church I almost never see that\nI'm especially with the evangelical world okay the ... church now a Catholicism ... has a lot of assets\nAre the Vatican has a very wealthy and so that's a different a different mindset on it but in evangelicalism the vast majority of the time those of us were sitting on that church border that elder board which I've done many times would say the investment is not to be made in um\nIn earthly investments but instead and\nEnd up people and causing people to make Christ and grow and crushed and that that that's the investments that we want to make and so the only actual wealth is retained as the paid for properties that the thing operates fan for the awesome retain earnings that are sitting there some\nSavings just to make sure that there's an operational buffer but\nUm but in terms of building an actual involvement in that setting I'm home nation ever see that helps answering questions that puts this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books will be back with you before you know what it means I'm remember there's ultimately only one way to financial peace and that's the thing with the prince of these crises\nGame faster than we have the same set forth a salad\nFive has to be here thank you for helping friendly [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you on of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize\nBut when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where and experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five\nYears and it was overwhelming to think where to begin your E.

military retirement and then the second career on top of that had it posted them into serious well so you guys are in a great position very very cool stuff\nAll right Chris end the call San Diego California sixty three thousand dollars laid off in twenty two months making\nOh thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nWell first of all the thing about you know three weeks ago when I was driving and I heard you're on the radio but my first baby with my mother or nine years I go to work\n[laughter]\nBut I have five but we ... we have five four one K. is our ...\nAnd I was wondering if she ... well no you might consider consolidating those cars former employees employers actually she and we roll their stuff but when I saw one in which\nEvery different four one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it\nBut you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous\nFor one case or previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you\nUm and that's advisable uh so uh yeah I I Would get was one of those smart disturb rose I was just talking about right before I picked up a call ... ... ... dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers or shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a\nTraditional i._r._a. to a tradition or traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a. there's no taxes on that if you do a direct transfer roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest\nWith recommendations that I use oddly enough\nA too that we put your in retirement than my retirement in four types of growth stocks mutual funds gross growth in income aggressive growth and international and are spread the total of the nest egg across those four\nAnd a evenly twenty five percentage\nKathy is with us in Wisconsin Hi Kathy how are you\nI'm good how are you there and in better than I deserve what's up\nUh my husband and I are looking to retire within the next two to three beers um has been for sure now we have a third of our income or about our retirement savings with\nA financial advice you currently and I'm Wondering what your opinion is and having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than one\n[noise] um the only reason that I'm I I worry a little bit is that you'd have all of your your retirement savings went one time\nIt's not with them they're just advise and you know you are and where to put it mhm you're not with them on their their the I mean it's like saying I'm you know I've got four\nDifferent cars and so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\n\nIt doesn't change the mix have you had two of the cars one mechanic and through the guards were the other mechanic you're still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them\nSo it makes sense [noise] yeah I Do I don't I don't know now like the ... [laughter]\nOkay well I it's not connecting them 'cause it's perfect but uh it added up to the ... the idea is this the investments that you have are not owned and operated by your financial adviser\nYou owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you on\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was won advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way because you're you\nShould be making the decision about where your money goes the advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where you're ... you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing it whenever you want you know no that's just dangerous as cried you need to know everything about where the money's going and understand everything about it\nAnd so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit\nAnd an information source and if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to you need one that their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five counts or mine or not his and he just advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more I'm more than one open another one whether or not one but\nTwo of 'em together we just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that than I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you're doing and if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that is what the analogy was trying to get to but I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nThere God how can I make my oh I'm I'll give you some numbers here real quick um I I'm fifty five thousand dollars in cash I have about forty or monitor Roth er\nAnd I make Seventy two thousand a year\nI'm I'm traveling nurse and I sold it all everything except for my ... my trailer and I'm traveling with my dog and we've got cheap or two fifty a month so I'm going to post up in Tucson while I searched for land\nUm where where I bought a house I Would say I'm the baby step for\nAnd I'm not contributing to the raw or any kind of\nYou know you've got some money sitting there to buy a house in a above and beyond your emergency fund some of that fifty thousand casually wouldn't labeling emergency brought in some of it we would label EMI a okay then thirty of it we would label for your down payment right\nNow I'm paying cash\nOkay thirty of it we would like to you got that much money saved up you're going to buy a piece of land because you're going to stay there yeah OK guys I got the cash bark and a ... year to move the trailer onto it\nInitially yeah and then I'll build build the the home when I was\nActually you're you're traveling nurse days are over\n[laughter] yeah but the kicker is is like in the land that so far out I could do this contract work um you know\nIndefinitely so that that's good that's a good thing there's plenty of work here and just work more strictly\nAbout on the line is you're you're not going to be you're not gonna be hooking up with air strider and haul went off to a ... to New York today travelling nurse stuff while you got a piece of land over in Tucson\nNo no I'm not so you are you are online it's settling down you're settling down then I got ... yeah you're right on track I think you're doing the right thing we said the emergency phone aside we bought the land and um then it sounds like you're going to pile money\nInto building for a while once you get the house bill for cash or then we would start retirement investing very aggressively 'cause you'll probably be a little bit behind at that point and I would go from there so I Am an good question and interesting should join shouldn't you put yourself in their ... their power cache there fifty grand soldier\nThat puts us our that Iran's you showing the books our thanks to things\nChild revolution then you want to search your producer vi I'm Dave Ramsey road [noise]\nMm\nMaybe I this is James child for the ... now so we're ... six hundred radio station here you had to ...

again you'll learn how to make a budget that actually works safe for emergencies get out of debt\nDid it on I mean credit as a student loan and we were under the impression Dora tiny that it you know what matter whether we put it down or not I mean we start getting credit rating that\nDoesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely\nWas bankrupted okay so did you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was my corrupted up your bankrupt she was discharged yeah OK\nThan if someone comes up you go and says we your sister in law and you say no that was bankrupted a there's a study originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody could find you people but\nYou know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupted I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly and like I got my husband's not very organized by um ... it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know a ... a a private student loan is basically an secured one\nIt's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal I'm ready for college is the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt double a whole lot of credit is bankrupt but we usually the difference\nYeah and then we have plenty of there we have plenty of Sally chair to pass\nYeah Sally Sally survives she's a resume how broad and so as you just can't get rid of her until you pay are often Victor\nBut the other stuff that's what you're saying I wouldn't worry about that right now I don't think it's going to come up if it does come up you don't have to go back and\nUm there's this later I filed bankruptcy Thirty years ago and there are two years later American Express came at me again on a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was listed they don't have to be notified\nA federal law and for a court in bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I had to shut them bankruptcy papers and told them you know just remove the account don't report on the account anymore you're not allowed to report on it because they count on longer does this mean they can't keep reporting it as bad debt after a bankruptcy on your credit bureau report\nBankruptcies though the line in the sand is drawn the chapter seven clears it now the chapter seven will stay on their credit report for ten years but the everything that caused it stops on that date and that's the way you look at it so\nGood question thank you for calling in I'm Sorry you guys are facing that but it sounds like you're coming out the other side open phones a AAA eight to five five two to
