confidence\nMhm okay so here's the situation I think you've got more talented than that I Want you to do an exercise where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I Want you to write out several skills that you have because you have more skills than just being able to talk will\nUh you you you you started a business and sold it started at fourteen and sold it I think you're thinking way too hard and I want you just release your brain right out the top three or four things you do best\nAnd then I Want you to go over to the passion side work that you just enjoy you find yourself you know this is a small task around the car if I was going to pay you to more than just be around cars what would you want to do all day and just begin to to let your mind\nRun and make a list of three or four of your top passions things that you enjoy to do and I don't want you to sit down with somebody who knows you very very well and is also truth telling your life and we want them to be able to verify and confirm both of those list the reason is is like 'cause I think you need a jolt of confidence\nAnd and you you're very special young lady who's done something pretty amazing at the age of twenty three\nAnd I think you're just you're over thinking and I think you need to get somebody else in your life will show you a mirror and you come away going okay I get it so back to that talent passion combo once you get clarity on that it's how do I use those top skills\nTo do work that I Love\nAnd and and if that's involving cars great but maybe just maybe you know you love talking to people about cars and help them get get in a new car do you get a lot of joy when you sell a car to somebody\nHow\nYeah how do you feel when they walk off a lot and they're pleased how's that make you feel\nThat if you get pressure yeah\nSo I think if you're looking long term to start a business I'd stay in that space I'd be thinking about how uh you can continue this idea [noise] um and and maybe expand it a little bit but what you're doing is is when I ask you this direct questions you're having a hard time identifying some specific things\nAnd this is important I think there's a lot of people out there in the same boat we get this we get this on on the cultural quite a bit\nAnd there is some type of limiting belief\nThat is holding you back when you can't quickly say these are some things I Do well\nBecause here's what I Know if I sit down with people who know you will and I interviewed them about you those of you that are listening right now that have a hard time seeing all this is this is a talent these are my top town when I sit with those people they're going to tell them the areas that you are good\nThings you do well\nAnd there's something that's holding your back and lock you up\n\nIs it that somebody verbally abused you did you have a failure in your life at some point\nThat has made you believe that you don't have much to offer\n\nFolks we deal with this every day and some of the out there are locked up on that one limiting belief\nAnd when you get beyond that and realize wait a second I have something to offer I have something to give then you begin to allow yourself to truly identify\nWhat it is that you do well and worked it makes your heart come alive sick a question from Facebook Rachel rights and should I

Nelson knock it out\n[noise] hey an anchor taking my call\nSure man knocking\n'em right so I'm looking for a while and ah I figured out last week which is\n... apparently it um creating an editing helm our town are you there okay and uh I watch or you could talk committee a practical okay I'm In research I found a video marketing firm real close to me\nAnd uh I kicked him out on a lake and and you know they're ... they're linked to a buddy of mine you know high school\nI'm here to your country coach and don't want to go up because it's a very universe get heard my call and gave me a great uh hey\nAwesome well have you talk to your buddy that ... that is at least connected to this company on linked in\nA I I haven't spoken about their uh you know where he lives nearby\nOkay well that's the first the first step is calling up saying hey uh I'm interested in learning more about this company I see that you're connected them on linked in what is your connection how strong is it that's the first thing\nBecause he could have a strong connection or maybe it's just a random connection or ... you see what I'm saying\nSo you are in um urine stage to and that is full on research and so you found and identified one company that does what you want to do you mentioned the proximity principle\nTo the Dave Ramsey show lizards you haven't heard that it's important to clarify what that is the proximity principal says in order to do what I Want to do in this case Nelson wants to do\nFilm an audio editing production work so in order to do that he's got to be around people that are doing that in in places that it is happening so here you're next steps after you talk to your buddy and see how strong that connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies or or companies that are in this space okay 'cause you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you we circle and say I need to learn more about those companies I Need to get in ...\nReally what I Want to and I want to work for myself and I just don't know how to make the jump from well even my current job on not excited about it all to go on to the mall or their career and that is completely in a different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where do you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently is kind of\nI Know it got to focus on one thing but um I'll have a degree of work development and I have a passion for development Web design\nA great website for companies and and just doing maintenance for companies [noise]\nUm but I also have a passion of a day Ramsey teachings and I've done the financial coach master courting and I would like to open up a practices you know maybe financial catch it on the side and I'm just it's completely different I'm not going to focus on one thing I just don't know\nWhat exactly I should be focusing on right now and that and and somebody give me that after\nNo well I think you have the answer I think you have any answer I'm going to put you on the spot\nOkay\nSo I Know that you're passionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn to that but I I I and I think that's fine I think you have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard ... clearly and definitively say that you always love designed and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job doing that right now how would you feel\nOh go right now go fantastic of course I'm so but here's the deal\nSo there's a pathway to getting there what are you doing right now what is your job and how much you're making\nA right now I Do a commercial laundry equipment recur her toga laundromat winners\n... what do you think I'm a about sixty five thousand a year but I Do a lot of time working in and out of town that's really kind of what can they burn now you've got to overcome All right do you have been out of town travel\nAre what are you completely out of debt what's your situation there\nAre also and by yourself to we started with about Seventy thousand and right now we're down to about a Eighteen thousand though he started ... years ago that's awesome\nUh we've we've had two babies are cash for a ... we've had a lot of medical expensive come up that we've been working for cash for it now but [noise]\nAh Josh aren't given up on the play oh listen ... good\nThat's incredible you're doing great what's your pay off day you've got an idea in mind if if life doesn't keep throwing some ... and everything stays the same when do you think you pay off that Eighteen thousand\nA bomb march march or April ... next year we that's where we're headed oh\nOkay so here's all I Want you to see\nFirst things first your current job I Know you're ... you're working hard but it's making a huge difference and in less than a year from now you're going to be debt free and then after that you're going to put an emergency fun together and get through baby step three how long do you think that's going to take\nA left when I hear from Monaco thirty six eight months for good a good emerged in front of like a six month\nI agree with that Josh that's not that much time for you to bite your lip and be the study he wrote that you're being right now and get yourself set up to make this step not asleep but a step so my other question is let's focus on the future so how much experience do you have with Web design\nAll I have a lot from the past but I Do know with technology everything ... sorry we're with that I'm kind of out of the loop on that as far as the code and stuff but the one good thing I have in my corner if I'm a very quick learner marketing\nI'm a self motivated or start right and wrong learn worms and stuff and I teach my subtle but as far as the\nOh knowledge I mean I've I've got a lot of knowledge\nThat's how I feel just a Josh here's the deal so you've got some experience which is great so you're you know that you've got the skill set this isn't a skill issue this was a train issue so you're the number one homework assignment\nToday is to go find out what qualifications you're going to need for the marketplace to say I'd hire Josh to do Web design that's that's number one homework assignment what additional qualifications slashed training education do you need and I'm I'm In college I just mean getting\nMore equipped and getting up to date to make yourself marketable\nSigned out what that is that when you find out what that is the next question is how much is this going to cost me\nFinancially\nThen the next question is based on my budget based on getting out of debt and everything that's going on in my life if it's going to cost me this much much financially how long will it take for me to complete that qualification which will then make me qualified and marketable to do the role I wanted it\nJosh ... that's all you got to do because once you get the answers to those questions that's your plan\nYou understand you just plug in play at this point All right to continue this much I'm going to say this much money I take this class this course and then you begin to practice proximity and talk to people who were in the Web design space in Winston Salem North Carolina\nWho's hiring Web designers or this could be companies that hire internal people or maybe it's a marketing group Asia you begin to identify targets now this is all happening\nJosh while you're paying off debt\nAnd this current sixty five thousand dollar over time gig is not going to burn you out any more 'cause you're going to change your attitude to one of gratitude which is this job is setting me up to step easily\nAnd triumphantly into the role that I ultimately won a field do you see where that is you see that about a year from now or maybe sooner if you get the qualifications sooner and you can get a Web design job that's going to pay you sixty five thousand or sixty thousand after you've paid off the debt\nIt's a game changer all of a sudden Josh you're waking up on Monday morning fired up and feeling so white you're not even sure if you're sitting in the car\n[laughter] that'd be fantastic but I mean you can see that can't you\nCan see how it is what you're saying that it makes me my my attitude change already and I'm I'm Glad I call Jim Gard you you've got a clarity that heater\nWill listen me and I'm Glad you called because I think there are millions of people that just hurts your story and they see themselves in\nYour story because you've you've got to figure it out\nAnd and it's just coming up with a basic plan Dave Ramsey has been giving people plan for twenty five plus years\nA folks there's five stages the ... and the dream one discovery who am I what do I want to do what I Want to do it next research just for me walk Josh through research what I Need to learn to be able to do what I Want to do then after I figure out the research what I Need to know who I Need to know\nWhat I Need to learn who I Need to know then we're going to move into\nActually embarking stepping out in making something happened practice that proximity press will get around people\nDoing what you want to do get in places where what you want to do is happening that's the embarking your start knocking off as mini milestones in those goals you're going to begin to achieve\nAnd as you achieve your ... gonna step into that dream roll the role that you were created to fill the world needs you to perform\nAnd that's the final stage of ... and the dream that's

counted down let's Sarah that free scream three to one\nThen they're not trustworthy enough to cut on you\nOr whatever procedure that this particular specialist is going to proceed with\nUm ... you know so\nNo I I wouldn't go to the doctor or I Would get comfortable with that doctor one of the two um I may be that that's off putting enough because it's kind of a weird request it may be that that's off putting enough to you that you just don't want to use this doctor but better than what you said in the email\nSometimes I hear people say you know I I'm not going to tie that church because I don't agree with things that are going on at that church\n\nBut you're going to trust them to spiritually train you you're going to trust them with your children's show one Sunday school class you're going to trust them to influence you on your view of scripture scripture and your walk with God but you don't trust them with your money\nWell let's just dumb so into the system that's appalling\nYou don't trust them enough to touch you don't trust them with money but you trust them with your soul that's just weird\nIt's just a bad idea so that that's the thing\nNow I have at times with the church that I'm attending while I'm watching the misbehavior of leadership and I've taken a little time off of tithing and set it aside little bit to see how this was going to turn out but long term if I'm not willing to give their I shouldn't go there\nAnd the same would be true of this doctor story here\nAnd is with us in Baltimore, Maryland Hi Ann how are you\nI'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] I paid thirty five well not paid off but I paid thirty five thousand dollars in less\nThan a year good for you I'm torn thank you taught student loans listening to you and then I was in a car crash and the money thing going for medical expenses and\nUm I two things I've lost my motivation and also and the other thing is I found a great deal I have some auto body um problems with my car and I found someone who is willing to do do it for cheaper price and I want to get that we've had that\nBut it's going to be eight hundred dollars\nAnd you don't have eight hundred dollars\nWell I have that I Know you're not gonna like that but I got it I have a\nThousand dollar emergency fund but the IRS gets hit me and they ... they are going to get that money [noise] um I can save up I mean I thought you were out of that\nOh no no no I'm not out of that well paid off their iPhone already five thousand less than a year now that was torn my student loan that\nActually I have and you didn't pay the IRS before you paid your student loan\nThat just came out of nowhere that I haven't I'm getting paid park in the mail from my CPA half a fan Tara\nT. O. F. F. A. marked on right now\nMhm ... mhm\nOkay and so you have one thousand dollar saved for emergencies is all\nYeah but I I have I got a credit card and I know you don't like credit card and I don't normally use credit cards but if you're an extra Twenty one lie and I can use that credit card aided pay a hundred dollars a month to\nUse it for one candidate for the auto body repair which is eight hundred dollars yeah yeah\nI ... and I mean that that's so backward from everything you've ever heard me say I'm appalled that you think I Would actually respond positively to that ridiculous statement\nI mean really you just called Dave Ramsey and said I Want to use a credit card on the air\nOkay well I take that back I Know [laughter]\nHow many there is Lee you are going on here no I mean you've gotta you've gotta think about now Dave Ramsey things but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation is you're inconsistent\nYou need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts and you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you had a car accident did you not get an insurance settlement for that\nNow they're saying that there was no no ... ... a damage to our vehicle and they're saying they don't believe that it um in that crash injured me but I I'm actually had pain before the crash occurred\nSo I'm just paying for myself with my health insurance\nOkay but I'm Talking about the car wreck did so you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollars I paid for my student\nOh\nOK instead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar pair Marine I want to do it now become a great deal because it's not it's damaged that\nI've been driving around with for a long time the other damage yeah well what am I may stop if we're not going to add on to a few thousand dollar let me stop you for\nA number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for you call me right number two this is not an emergency\nSmaller margins going there it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal not emergency and you don't have any money you accept what's in your emergency fund now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so now you need to clear up the Irish and you need to save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just want to be able to do it with him you just missed that deal but so what\nI'm ... you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision and a lot of the things circling around this conversation and have had that field with them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan and live that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis come into your life anytime there's a problem you just get back on track back on track\nBack on track and when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only are money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life that I also felt like a dog tracing its tail or you just been going in circles\nAnd that's what's going on I can hear it I can feel it and talking to you you're going to be All right but that's what you need to do and now we're not going to use a credit card to take advantage of a bargain to fix your car\nNot what they are athletes that are now and is not an emergency so we're not using the emergency fund and very clear principles Sharon slides and you just like a fly them to everyone else
