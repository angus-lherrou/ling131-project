off overseas I for a long time had or for the first couple of years of my employment I had the opportunity to do extensions\n... and we use those extensions which kind of worked out like all the time and kind of cover expenses and make things and all that and then buddy the months ago I was told that\nWe wouldn't be getting any more extensions\nSo I was I was overseas at the time and Mary where I couldn't really calls though I had to do everything by text them I texted her and said here's what it's looking like which are understandably we we were doing things are upset her quite a bit\nYoung rumors dropped off\nA yeah yeah just to be good to be your income there and she was pretty upset about that so we were considering cashing out my four one K. two things off and to kind of makers will hold again\nAnd and then what happened at that point is when we got done ... that night [noise] um I was like you said very upset I started looking into the four one K. option I didn't like that option because we've already in our past of Twenty years cashed in a couple of my small retirements when I quit a job\nAnd so I called my brother at like eleven o'clock at night he works nights so I can talk to him and I called my brother Charlie and he kinda ripped me is what he\nDid Dave Ramsey on me because I'm\nJust said that you know we make too much money to me that's broke and he told me that we could you know he started telling me we could solve this or that and he started talking about selling the car and selling the tractor and selling the truck getting\nThe van and I kind of came up with excuses for every one and you know it wasn't really listening very well and hung up like in tears just crying and\nTried to go to sleep but Clinton and ended up getting up out of bed a went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down in the first thing I looked at was the car um it was the only vehicle we other than the tractor that we owe money on still\nUm we had my mini van was paid off um had over two hundred thousand miles um\nBut wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happen to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas handle yeah you know\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr that and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get to buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put us in it it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back him what I'd been doing and he said he would buy us F P U\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of cats and I didn't

going to be sure what's up\nSo I've got a question for you so my dad has a small\nGroup working with them for about seven years and I just started a family from time to panic over the kind of make it better on every time and he wants to try out there because he\nSaid that's the best way that the amount you can over taxes rather than\nSaving money and it never been able to hold over twenty five years and you've never been able to have really\nMhm well that's why you know is because you keep spending money on debt to buy stuff but he don't even need to say on taxes are the the math that he's doing is unbelievably faulty\nOkay let me give me an example what what would be a typical purchased a will be the size of the equipment I'm fifty thousand dollar item a hundred thousand right out while yeah but you\nCut down on the bus or fifty thousand dollar item um in years past he had to he could not write that all off in one year\n... off over five years or ten thousand dollar you're right off and if he has a ten thousand dollar you're right off you don't get to say it doesn't say ten thousand dollars on your tax bill okay\nMhm instead what it does is it would save you about two thousand dollars on your tax bill now what we're saying is that he borrowed fifty thousand dollars to save two thousand dollars a year on this tax bill for five\nYears\nYeah the the math is really really faulty there\nAnd so what happens is entrepreneur is either don't think this through an or use this as a rationalization to buy toys inside their business that they really can't afford she goes out to quit buying equipment until you can pay cash for it and then and then you're going to buy older used equipment only equipment you need to do the job\nWe don't buy anything here in our office if we don't have to have it to get the job done when about anything in the tax write off\nThe way he explained it to she has to have because it has to be you know because if they are not going to break down but the one that won't be because it break down and look out for ten days off that the way he ex wife and I\nTell them you're telling me all two year old and three year old tractors aren't safe and break down all the time again\nNot asinine ... that's just ridiculous\nOK here's the other thing is kind of a doctor Phil moment he's worked just bought off all these years and he has no money mhm and Dr phil would say how's that working for you\nYeah it's not you know childhood theory of years working out here it's not working out and so I don't know how to tell you to tell your dad what to do he's probably not listening to you and he's probably look Lena may see the point\nNow finally starting to take it you know I\nKeep going if you're running it if you're running than if you're running it then you get to make the decision and you and I just decided you can ... I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment but I've got\nProbably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now while we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we're going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nOr whether it's cameras are computer systems in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment\nUm couple pickup trucks to do delivery and stuff around here and one bus that keeps running us between buildings but other than that we don't have any big stuff like that but still I Can't have that bus breaking down all the time but on the bus used\nDonald Harris drives our bus everyday runs us back and forth between our little shuttled between our things and it's it was a huge shuttle and I paid attempt for what a new one cost\nAnd it's run I mean it's broken down a couple of times when we rented a shuttle for that day when it broke down kept kept moving we'll put it in the shop and fixed it but I mean for that little bit of inconvenience it's safe\nAnd it's been reliable enough to get the job done and not shut us down\nAnd so that's a minor example but it's filling in the same metaphor and so yeah you can you can make this work\nBy use to pay cash for your equipment otherwise all you do is work for nothing\nAll you do is end up with no money for all your work because and and the you know the heavy equipment dealer gets all your money and that just doesn't work for me I don't want to live that way [noise] Josh is in Savannah hey Josh welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHow you doing

he may be at the executor impact well um I've never seen that well the interesting thing I Would at fat fry make sure I fully understand hip ... after he had a question it is it appropriate to I can see that well and do you have any suggestions on how to track that conversation\nOr it's more than appropriate as a matter of fact just flat out strange he made you the executor without first talking to you\nThat's why we're [laughter] yeah I got that too that's up to bury presumptive\nSay the least show a let's re start the conversation ... ...\nAh I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider helping you in this way and I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the honor I think uh but there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your exact number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the wheel and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by the will have to be informed before your death what the will says\n'cause I'm not going to implement stuff that I get blamed for and everybody's pissed at me and it was you that did it\nYou follow me mhm ...\nYeah 'cause you're going to have like your cousins or whoever it is that he's asking you to not give money to that thinks they're getting money they're not going to be mad at him he's dead they're going to be mad at you and\nAll you are allowed to do by the wall is exactly what the ... and yet you're going to get all the relational blame and all the emotional blame and I'm not set myself up for that no way we're going to have a to live a reading of the deal\nWith the parties that are involved they're all going to know what it says I mean junior boys getting cut out 'cause he's doing heroin we need to go and tell him while he's alive he gets no money\nWell I'm Still alive if he won't do that and he won't let you see everything in advance just say honey I understand you don't have to do that at your stuff but you need to take me off of the executor ship\nBecause those are my terms for serving as executor does that sound unreasonable you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as ... ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it I'm not going to take it I told him while he's alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it after ... don't get built into it\nOkay thanks for the call open

apprenticeship agreed to live in her basement and now you're open to put up with her\n[laughter] goes with the territory is what you got signed up for it you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship right that you're talking to her you're stuck there for six more months or ... as a six more months left in this thing\n[noise] um [noise]\nIt's like I said we don't really

guys need a nail this deal down so he you know what you signed up for and you know what you've signed up for so you can see alive and the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big honking car payment and he'd sell the car or just
