what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give you some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house shock yeah the way to go yeah we're happy about that a decided uh you know fell off and investments just to do that people kind of\nOkay how old is she sixty three\nWhy are you now power of attorney\n[noise] she's starting to forget that um\nKept getting checked out for the amounts that I think in the process of doing that and she hasn't been paying that I put her on a budget so now I'm taking care of her stuff\nWhat is your income\nUm she makes ... about twenty eight thousand air\nMhm okay and um what is the house\nWere hired sorry what's the house worth um my sister lives in it and she kind of destroyed it I'm sure I'm where's your mother and my own apartment\nYour mother is paying rent an apartment so that your sister can live in the house\nYeah so what's the house worth I'm guessing sixty five\nOkay okay so how fast is are you a throwing your sister out and selling the house\nSide on friday [laughter] she's on a date I Can't figure out\n\nAre you on the deed last phone line how did she get on the deed [noise]\nUm my sister has um a child with me so my mom wanted to make sure my niece had a place to land so she put my sister on it\nAre you paying that is your mother paying the mortgage\nProblem not any more I was ... yeah I told my sister I Would not anymore yeah everything everything's in my ... all the utilities everything as take 'em out yeah I Can't turn the heat off\nCan't tell you Keli Goff author kind of\nYour ... and her name [noise] um he\nHas a fence but she can't because her deposits too high\nUh-huh 'cause she doesn't have to pay her down so they they tend to posit too yeah compensate for that\nBut you can see to pay the bill\nRight yeah okay ... pay the bill that and that's it and she used to\nPay the mortgage today yeah okay I got rid of fifty eight thousand other debt good and one hundred and one thousand in student loans passes away when your mom passes away\nYeah okay so we don't worry about those quit paying the dad quit paying the students that equipment\nIn student loans so now I got to eleven thousand dollars in some medical bills\nThat does the rest of it we're just not paying your mom don't have any money she broke his apparently got dementia mess twenty eight thousand dollars a year she\nSixty three years old you're living in an apartment we have to make sure she's cared for first and that's food shelter clothing transportation and utility she doesn't need transportation [noise] did you say there was a car in here does she need to be driving\n[noise] I'd say no you're the power of attorney yeah\nI Know that I've tried to convince her to sell her car and get a thousand dollars a pack of fifty eight hundred dollars is a lot for a car so\nIt's not a lot for a car but it's a lot for a car for somebody that has dementia and I'm not sure they need to be driving right now I Can't remember to pay your bills country remember how to get home I'm scared for her\nThat was one of the time she forgot how did you get home that's what started it\nIs it responsible on your part to let her drive the answer is no\nRight\nShe I Love her you love or you don't want her to be hurt or to hurt someone for God's sakes that she could she could go driving often end up in Tennessee from\nWisconsin\nAnd we'd have one of those silver alerts or whatever they call them right yeah yeah no I think we're going to I think we're going to do away with cars period oh okay now we're down to medical bills\nThese are very hard decisions for you right but you have to do\nYour job has the power of attorney and as a loving daughter is do things that are good for your mom regardless of who it upsets\nYour sister is upset your mother's upset I don't care yeah it's\nVery hard for you to make those decisions but we're only going to do things that are good for your mom none of this you are doing is out of greed for yourself\nOK so all the student loan people they get zip nothing nada okay\nSo yeah she ... she gets nothing not a zip sell the car\nNow I'm Down to just a few medical bills and I think you can work your way through those with her income or at least get some kind of a payment plan going this very small and ah you can let that attorney's office know that basically she has no money what ... what is the twenty eight thousand dollars coming in from\nUm he has a pension I knew it in her security\nOkay I'm than what I probably would do with these medical bills is let them know they're probably not going to get paid either except if I have a little extra money here or there after taking care of mom\nBecause I paid fifty on on each one\nAnd it's okay if you don't pay twenty five or something or if if you can work out some kind of lump sum and you know five hundred bucks shuttles a whole dad or something like that clears up that's fine but here's the thing if they were to\nSue her do you know what they're going to get nothing because she you know what she has nothing all of the income that she has they cannot attach you can attach pension income you can attach Social Security income and you can't attachment annuity\nAnd so that she is what we called judgment proof because she's broke\nAnd so that puts you in a very strong position to talk to Mr or Mrs collections bottom feeder attorney when you do talk to them\nAnd just go here situation she's sixty three she's got dementia she has no assets and are only income which pension and Social Security she's judgment proof tell them I said that when we talk to him than actual coach and he said they are judgment proof\nOkay and uh so what we'll do is we would like to clear this up but we're going to do it for pennies on the dollar so make me a ridiculous offer because that's the only way you're getting any money\nAnd play hardball with them because we got to take care of mom here I'm not trying to I'm not trying to beat him by up I'm not trying to hurt anybody I'm trying to protect your mom\nAnd the last thing I Need it she she gets her food paid her lights and water her rant and she is taking care of only then do we deal with a couple of medical bills seller car sister gets nothing student loan gets nothing\nSo I I'm I'm saying this real kind of like 'cause I Want you to get a little that down inside 'cause I Know these are going to be hard conversations for you yeah but you got to be our cars at your mom you're protecting okay exactly you can do it you can do it if you need some help you call me\nBack but just just play hardball with um terms those shoes judgment proof my goodness what a story [noise] wow\nThere's a reason to save for retirement ...
