this week in history\nI didn't hear the crunching of the picnic basket uh-huh and my wife uh stuck or had a door and said\nGod [laughter] [laughter]\nI never heard that story before you know that's all\nYeah yeah no I Do not a good not pick up the crunching\nOf ethics bad and so you know the real kind of start over as you might say on the\nThat was a probably a probably unique day for a while uh in in one you've probably never quite live down with with your while I was on many levels that was\nPretty good for for a ... million to concept\nBut you know and and it's usually what happens is it takes something it takes that it just takes that\nI guess we call it the ... moment just that moment of wow you know I don't you know or\nAs you get to holidays or you know um get togethers or you get to um ball games you get to things where you're around people that you're around a lot and you start finding yourself\nNot being really part of it you're you're there but you're not really involved because you're just kind of a a passive participant of you to smile and shake your head and someone talks to you yeah because\nWhen you miss part of the conversation ... pretty soon there's a there's a time when you're ... you're the limit is up of saying\nUh say again please or what was that yes and you know you've got like a get out of jail require ... yeah\nI didn't quite get that well I you know after a few of those I mean you feel like well I Can't do this or any more so now you go on and you miss those first few words and and so now you're thinking some sometimes you're not really sure of what they're talking about\nSome ... yes so then if you know if it's a situation where maybe it's someone you've just met\n'em and you you know the drill or they're going to start talking I'm not going to hear very well smile and shake my head and but it's maybe it's someone new maybe it's you know you and your wife met someone new and you went out for dinner you met them somewhere and you're having a conversation and you walk away and you you know you look at your wife you say you know I I like them and they walk away\nAnd go what was his deal you know did he not was he not really paying attention to us did he not really feeling gauge and it's not that you know you walked away with a different feeling they walked away saying I don't know you know I'm not real sure about him or her or whatever it is\nAnd you met while you just couldn't get engaged in the conversation because you know the drill you get in the conversation you see there are a lot when you see their lips move\nAnd that's about as far as that goes you just hear that you see the lips but you don't ... you hear it but you can't quite make out the conversation see smile and then you leave and you look at your wife and you say\nYou know give me the recap of that whole conversation you caught some of it not all that um and then it just leads to a whole lot of issues because now what you thought would you know maybe\nIn our relationship of let's meet you know let's see these people again or hang out or you know whatever let's invite him to dinner where they are they're walking away with a completely different opinion\nAnd it's not the case but that first impression is what it is and it's just [noise] just everybody has to go through I don't know why I mean you know it's just one of those things that everybody goes through\nAnd then they come to the terms or you know they may not come to terms with it but they say okay Brin grudgingly I'm going to go get my hearing checked\nThe average person from the time they find out that they have a hearing loss wait seven years to treat it\nI'd say that's about right yeah and I I mean I don't have a fix on it\nBut that they've done studies on it but um\nTelling you it's it's about the average and\nYeah you know I tell you one you know I knew\nA probably Twenty years ago that I had the nerve damage I got ... I I my particular nerve damage came from sitting in the in crowd basketball crowds especially football crowd some got me on during the play by play I don't want him to the radio um\nAh mostly basketball though so I knew I had the nerve damage so then I\nI started to and I knew I had some hearing loss you know at that point you have any way back so I started wearing the are earplugs you know during the game you know the headset was all part of a young on to the ... the loud had said first are wearing earplugs and then that certainly helped and then when I was more on the lawn and\nCentered cetera but the if you you mentioned the seven year time when it really got bad you know really started to get that I started really missing things\nThat was probably about that far yet\nMac and that's normal and [noise] you know in the last um seven\nYears roughly we have learned so much about hearing loss and not so much about the hearing loss itself but all the other things that go along with hearing loss the\nUm dementia the link to diabetes the\nA body mass index the the smoking the little blue pill um you know all the things that we know now that we didn't know twenty Thirty years ago\nIt was the old saying we always we always call it the John Wayne syndrome you know the guy would come in and sat down you know I'm not going to go until I'm dead and that was just how everybody looked at it or I'll get hearing aids when I Can't hear anymore we used to all laughed and you know then that would be whenever they decided they'd come in\nWell now that we know that by waiting you're actually damaging your brain and causing your brain harm your ears just conduct the sound and what happens when\nThe the hairs and the the mentally or get broken off inside the coke where they get broken off they don't re grow so now you're getting signals that are mixed going to the brain because it's going through a broken you know it's going through that broken hair\nThe incorrect signals are going to the brain and what happens is the brain becomes dormant and loses the ability to understand words so when we give you the test if you have poor discrimination hearing aids will not correct that we can't restore comprehension now we can help with the hearing loss yeah what\nDid I read somewhere in the brain Ninety percent and the IRS ten percent yeah\nIt's just because of the ears are conducting it I mean they're just carrying the signal brain does all the processing and by not treating your hearing loss you're actually pulling from other areas of the brain because of how much\nAh how much brain power not and it's kind of agree what to say but brain power that hearing takes that by not treating it you're causing the brain to kind of go into overdrive but all it does is pulls it from other areas so think about it as like a pie\nYour brain as a pie the only has so much you can't make the pie bigger the brain is what it is so all it's doing is cutting the pie in different portions but stealing from other areas\nTo compensate for your hearing loss that's where we get into the dementia and get into other things because we're accelerating um brain shrinkage\nAnd we're accelerating um the brain's ability to comprehend and its its cognition and comprehension that we worry about it's not you're hearing loss as you're hearing loss when you come in we've got a hearing aid that will work with any hearing loss you know bring up each frequency and in compensate for it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Concept By Iowa Hearing Aid Ctr", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "20"}
