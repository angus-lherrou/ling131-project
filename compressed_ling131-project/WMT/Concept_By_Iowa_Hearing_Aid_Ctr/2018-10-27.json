earlier\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy six Bob Seeger releases his ninth studio album night move it's his first with a silver bullet band group of Detroit area musicians that helped launch Seeger into the mainstream singles included the title track main street\nAnd rock and roll never forget [noise]\nAlso this weekend Nineteen Seventy six Led Zeppelin who avoided TV appearances because of sound problems appear on American television for the first time when they played Don ... rock concert they perform black dog and dazed and confused and this week in the year two thousand George Michael paid one forty five million pounds\nPut the Steinway piano which John Lennon wrote imagine George said I Know that when my fingers touch the keys of that sign way I Will feel truly blessed and partying with\nMy money has never been much of a problem just asked my accountants the singer outfit Robbie Williams and the oasis brothers [noise] there's this\nWouldn't even want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after his head as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent a police to help convict the crooks\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a bad how\nAre they have had cancer are being treated with chemotherapy\nThat can cause hearing loss um auto toxic drugs demise in group\nA little blue pill um\nThere are so many things now that can can attribute to hearing loss the number one causes a noise exposure so if you've been around and it was mine from the from the crowd basketball ... in a ... in ... uh they have measured can get up to a hundred and thirty five decibels\nDamaging is eighty five so we're talking in every ten decibels actually doubles\nAh so that's a lot of lot of noise in in ... you know I'm not sure I've never seen what they but I Know it can get really loud and they're a\nLot of the people that are coming to you our farm guys who long yeah a lot of mushy you bet\nI'm so factory workers caught you know I'm contractors construction workers are I mean any kind of noise exposure so if you're listening right now and you've heard me you know any one of these things or multiple things\nThen it's it's time you you know pick up the phone call it's a free hearing test so the process then is you call you make the appointment and then we do the rest you come in we encourage you to bring 'em whether it's a spouse um you know a friend or loved one\nWe want everyone to be in the conversation understand what's going on 'em and then when you go home\nYou everyone heard the same thing you're not going home and trying to interpret to somebody else what you heard you're going to have retained about twenty percent of what you hurt so if someone else is there now we're going to have more information that everyone heard\nWe just want make to make sure everybody understands so you come into your appointment um we always budget two hours for your appointment um and that's on the long and but we want to make sure that we have plenty of time to a a fill out a lifestyle survey\nSo we understand what your typical day is like not every hearing aid works for every um environment the same\nThere is a what we call a simple there is a moderate and there's a complex well if you're a simple person\nYou know simple lifestyle where it's I really don't get out much maybe go out to lunch or dinner one time a week maybe church um but other than that you know it's just me and my spouse at home or maybe I'm by myself\nThat's a simple lifestyle that can be a simple hearing it doesn't require as much if you're an active person out and about all day long in different settings you need to hearing aid to make adjustments without you having to do anything that requires a complex so understanding who you are and what your day is like so you fill that out\nYou fill out your your history of just what's going on with your hearing loss and um your spouse or whoever you bring with you can answer some questions as well\nSo that's just the initial part then we bring you in for the full hearing test\nWe check your hearing loss we will give you words and have you repeat them because there's two parts to hearing their hearing and then there's understanding so hearing just means All right we give you a tone test you push the button when you hear the tone so we know where you're hearing losses\nBut then when we ask the words and happy repeat them if you don't treat your hearing loss your brain actually loses the ability to understand words so even though I treat your hearing loss\nDoesn't mean your brain is going to comprehend it's because you've waited the signals haven't got there in the brain just forgot the issue is hearing age don't correct understanding\nThey work with a hearing loss but they can't restore understanding or speech comprehension because you it's a brain thing it's an ear thing it's a brain thing\nSo we give you the words than we do a bone conduction to see if there's any middle ear issues we also look in your ears within the scope as well let's see if there's wax or anything that um\nWill skew that the test because we want to know when we want to clean it lacks out if we need to do the word recognition and we do a speech annoys test takes about two minutes\nWe give you five sentences you repeat the sentences but as that goes the background noise will get worse that will tell us when we treat your hearing loss how well were you doing in noisy situation it's just a really good test it takes two minutes that gives us a lot of information\nSo then when we're done with that than we sit down and we go over the results\nUm make the recommendation and we can even program hearing aids up right there if we have the right ones in program up right there and you can walk out in two hours wearing a pair of hearing aids treating your hearing loss and starting your new life all in under two hours\nSo it's very simple and very easy\nIt all starts with the phone call and if you do what I mean you you get to trial them yes if you dirty day who you are if you were walking out with those growing up you get you get\nA chance to try them out and find out how they're working\nAnd yeah it's a thirty day five hundred percent money back guarantee so you've got to guarantee that if something's just not right now I always caution people\nHearing loss isn't easy treating it isn't easy wearing hearing aids for the first time especially the worse you're hearing loss gets the harder it is to adjust um just because your brain is used to a certain way and your brain will re adjust it just\nTakes time and ... and then I mean let's talk about an exception just given what let me interrupt or just briefly for me no adjustment\nAh you're the you're one of the lucky as it was I mean I was not as a little while I Need to take these however while I I Need to ... ... ... it was just\nYou know from from the very start and right on through my day yep perfectly comfortable\nYeah and part of that is a mental thing\nMentally you have to be ready\nMentally you if you're if you are at least accepting somewhat that okay it's time I know I mean I Know but I really don't know if I have a hearing loss but I'm at that point where I accept that um you'll do a lot better\nIf you're an individual that comes in and you just are mentally fighting having a hearing loss\nIt's a struggle because it's a mental thing you've got a mental hurdle\nThat you have to get over and that's usually what it is it's not the hearing aids don't over amplifier they don't you know hearing aids aren't doing anything more than they're supposed to [noise] it's just when you\nTreat your hearing loss you know every day ... you know as you're hearing loss developed as just a little bit little bit little bit little bit we're just used to it it's a comfort level of wherever you're hearing loss is when you come in\nYou're used to it because you've lived with it so it's just that comfort level and he's with me and then when you put hearing aids on we're just erasing that time\nNothing you know a newspaper or being in a restaurant any isn't any louder than it was when he had normal hearing it's just your brain doesn't know what normal is because normal is different than when it was Twenty years ago\nLike first time I turned on the microwave [laughter] what's wrong with this thing [laughter] yeah\nWe actually had a guy wants got his pickup truck and came back for his checkup and said I'm mad at you guys he said I got my pick up and the thing was a piece of junk I had to go traded in 'cause it made all kinds of noise and he just hadn't heard as soon as we bought a hearing is Anna Anna new pick up\nAnd it's just because you just don't know and it's not a bad thing it's just it's what your what your new normal is a is different every day and just deteriorated so your new normal is whatever it is\nAnd all I can say is the longer you wait\nThe bigger your new normal is because it just keeps deteriorating it's like if you waited to get glasses until you were like twenty three hundred", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Concept By Iowa Hearing Aid Ctr", "city":
