{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "WMT", "content": "Good morning and welcome to the special concept by Iowa hearing aids centers program I'm pleased to be with concept corner Taylor partner for the next half hour\nTo talk about my success with concepts hearing aids and to hear from Taylor about hearing and hearing age our goal is of course to pass along information at all a Jew or a loved one of yours or someone you know possibly has a hearing loss that can be help with the things we're going to\nTalk about a year and with that it's a\nGood good morning drew Taylor partner good morning yeah it's great to be here as always alright how shall we start shall we start like we're gonna start somebody must learn that again and hearing loss\nYet we're gonna start 'em one on one on one hearing hearing one oh one just what I did yeah I'm In your wife was a big she was a big help and now I was mad about yeah God I Love her to death [laughter]\nSo\nIf you you know if you're one of these people you know that that says I don't know you know I I don't know if I have a hearing last I I think I Do okay I don't know well here's some things to look for do you turn the TV or radio up do you ask people to repeat\nWhen you get into a crowd or a restaurant do you find yourself struggling to you know have a conversation because it's how ... how what\nI'm asking people to repeat a using your spouse as an interpreter when you go places and it stopped going to events if you were\nPulling back from going to places because you may not hear very well\nAnd you haven't really put the two together of I don't hear very well but that's not why I'm going it's just I don't ... going but it just never really clicked that\nOh I'm not very well so what do you know what what um what what's going on um if you are a type one type two diabetic if you're an aspirin regimen if you have a body mass index of twenty seven or higher if you've um\nAre have had cancer are being treated with chemotherapy\nThat can cause hearing loss I'm Out of toxic drugs demise in group\nOr the little blue pill um\nThere's so many things now that can can attribute to hearing loss the number one causes a noise exposure so if you've been around and yet was mine from the from the crowd basketball ... and a ... in ... uh they have measured can get up to a hundred and thirty five decibels\nDamaging is eighty five so we're talking in every ten decibels actually doubles\nAh so that's a lot of lot of noise in in ... you know I'm not sure I've never seen what they but I Know it can get really loud and they're a\nLot of the people that are coming to you our farm guys\nOh yeah a lot much you bet I'm so factory workers caught you know I'm contractors construction workers are I mean any kind of noise exposure so if you're listening right now and you heard me you know any one of these things are multiple things\nThen it's it's time you you know pick up the phone call it's a free hearing test so the process then is you call you make the appointment and then we do the rest you come in we encourage you to bring 'em whether it's a spouse um you know a friend or loved one\nWe want everyone to to be in the conversation understand what's going on 'em and then when you go home\nYou everyone heard the same thing you're not going home and trying to interpret to somebody else what you heard you're going to have retained about twenty percent of what you hurt so if someone else is there now we're going to have more information that everyone heard\nWe just want make to make sure everybody understands so you come into your appointment um we always\nBudget two hours for your appointment um and that's on the long and but we want to make sure that we have plenty of time to a a fill out a lifestyle survey so we understand what your typical day is like not every hearing aid works for every um environment and the same\nThere is a what we call a simple there is a moderate and there's a complex while if you're a simple person you know simple lifestyle where it's I really don't get out much maybe go out to lunch or dinner one time a week maybe church um but other than that you know it's just me and my spouse at home or maybe I'm by myself [noise]\nThat's a simple lifestyle that can be a simple hearing it doesn't require as much if you're an active person out and about all day long in different settings you need to hearing aid to make adjustments without you having to do anything that requires a complex so understanding who you are and what your day is like so you fill that out\nYou fill out your your history of just what's going on with your hearing loss and um your spouse or whoever you bring with you can answer some questions as well\nSo that's just the initial part then we bring you in for the full hearing test\nWe check your hearing loss we will give you words and have you repeat them because there's two parts to hearing there's hearing and then there's understanding so hearing just means All right we give you a tone test you push the button when you hear the tone so we know where you're hearing losses\nBut then when we ask the words and happy repeat them if you don't treat your hearing loss your brain actually loses the ability to understand words so even though I treat your hearing loss\nDoesn't mean your brain is going to comprehend it's because you've waited the signals haven't got there in the brain just forgot the issue is hearing aids don't correct understanding\nThey work with a hearing loss but they can't restore understanding or speech comprehension because you'd some rain thing it's an ear thing it's a brain thing [noise]\nSo we give you the words than we do a bone conduction to see if there's any middle ear issues um we also look in your ears within the scope as well let's see if there's wax or anything that um\nWill skew that the test because we want to know when we want to clean the wax out if we need to um do the word recognition and we do a speech annoys test takes about two minutes\nWe give you five sentences you repeat the sentences but as that goes the background noise will get worse that will tell us when we treat your hearing loss how well were you doing in noisy situation it's just a really good test it takes two minutes that gives us a lot of information\nSo then when we're done with that than we sit down and we go over the results\nUm make the recommendation and we can even program hearing aids up right there if we have the right ones in program up right there and you can walk out in two hours wearing a pair of hearing aids treating your hearing loss in starting your new life all in under two hours\nSo it's very simple and very easy but it all starts with the phone call and if you do what I mean you you get to trial them yes if you dirty day who\nYou were if you were walking out with those ... ... you get you get a chance to try them out and find out how they're working\nAnd yeah it's a thirty day five hundred percent money back guarantee so you've got to guarantee that if something's just not right now I always caution people hearing loss isn't easy treating it isn't easy wearing\nHearing aids for the first time especially the worse you're hearing loss gets the harder it is to adjust um just because your brain is used to a certain way and your brain will re adjust it just takes\nTime and ... and then I mean let's talk about an exception just let let me interrupt or just briefly for me no adjustment\nAh you're the you're one of the lucky as it was I mean I was not as a little while I I Need to take these however while I Need to ... ... ... it was just\nYou know from from the very start and right on through my day yep perfectly comfortable\nYeah and part of that is a mental thing\nMentally you have to be ready\nMentally you if you're if you are at least accepting somewhat that okay it's time I know I mean\nI Know but I really don't know if I have a hearing loss but I'm at that point where I accept that um you'll do a lot better if you're an individual that comes in and you just are mentally fighting having a hearing loss\nIt's a struggle because it's a mental thing you've got a mental hurdle\nThat you have to get over and that's usually what it is it's not the hearing aids don't over amplifier they don't you know hearing aids aren't doing anything more than they're supposed to it's just\nWhen you treat your hearing loss you know every day ... you know as you're hearing loss developed as just a little bit little bit little bit little bit we're just used to it it's a comfort level of wherever you're hearing loss is when you come in\nYou're used to it because you've lived with it so it's just that comfort level and he's with me and then when you put hearing aids on we're just erasing that time\nNothing you know a newspaper or being in a restaurant any isn't isn't any louder than it was when you had normal hearing it's just your brain doesn't know what normal is because normal is different than when it was Twenty years ago", "show_name": "Concept By Iowa Hearing Aid Ctr", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "13"}
