I'm not really feeling pasta today we haven't always available menu that has grilled deli seasonal items to choose from and you can tap it off again without ice stream if anyone you\nWell it sounds it sounds like you have all the accommodations and all those things someone would need if they're looking to do something like this right\nVery true and I think the biggest misconception of all is a move to a retirement community means lots of independence means I don't get these choices anymore\nAnd I think people aren't seeing the bigger picture if they live in a home that has two or three story or if they're laundries in the basement there's parts of their home they're not even able to get to see if they can no longer drive there they're having to line up um other combinations for travel so they're probably not getting our see their friends as much so they're really isolating themselves at their home\nWhen they moved to a retirement community they have so many more options and they have the ability to make those choices so\nRather than just sort of eating whatever meals on wheels delivers or whatever's in the pantry we have a full always available menu\nRather than not having the option to get out and play cards with friends or you know go to entertainment uh events\nThat's right down the hall for you I'm rather than not being able to get that laundry done you want to or the house keeping the way they always used to we do that right in included in the package so there really is so much more opportunity to have that independence than at home a lot of time\nYou're talking to Dr briefly the in the entertainment part of that what you do provide things maybe even on a daily basis as they can attend and then they'll do something like that those are\nAbsolutely so every single one of our communities has an activity calendar that's created by ... by our life enrichment coordinators and our standard is to have at least six things on the activity calendar per day\nAnd they need to be buried so some of them will be exercise programs like our lived to be healthy a senior exercise program that means three times a week it could be crafting it could be religious or spiritual cultural events it could be a an internal event that we are bringing in a music or you know\nActing into the community or it could be something where we're taking everyone out on our bus and going to see the high school play or I'm going to see the local um you know production that's in town so\nWe're really really listening to our residents in what they're wanting to do in tailoring that activity calendar to them so you won't see a copy and paste version of our activities and all twenty six of them it's all very individualized to the community and the residents themselves\nNo the transportation forward and they set it up and take them through the doctor or shopping or whatever they seemed to have to do it's a time\nAbsolutely so all they have to do is I walked on our front desk or give us a call and say hey I have an appointment at such and such places such and such time and we say All right we'll be there with bells on that's kind of how it works so\nAnd if you're a loved one listening to this and thinking well all my mom or dad they can't go to that appointment by themselves out I won't ever hear what actually happened in that appointment first of all our healthcare coordinators have such great communication tools with the doctors we hear this all the time like oh we know that when we give orders that it's gonna be relayed correctly and it can be taken care of\nOr the other thing is rather than take a whole day off work which is what my mom used to have to deal with my grandparents\nWhen they needed to get to the doctor they can just show up if they want to meet us that the appointment stay for what you need to and then get back to what you're doing you don't have to worry about the transportation\nThe picking up of the the um prescriptions that that was prescribed during the appointment it's sort of whatever works for you we're going to work with families to make sure that they get what they need a need to know what they want to know\nUh and then if they'd like to just sort of hear the the cliff notes of what happened we can provide that as well\nWell that's a good thing because a lot of people like to have somebody there to verify what ... what they heard why they herded and what they're supposed to do next\nAbsolutely 'cause I hear this all the time just because I said at one way doesn't mean they did that as well and it's true it takes clarification sometime\nYou but you provide a lot of great things and now you have some openings in the area that people could make a call on that would uh I Know you mentioned perennials and Clinton a little bit I Know you have a couple of openings are over there or if you do you always have openings are pretty well fill up and then you don't\n... it really just depends on the community so like I said we have twenty six all across the Iowa one in Illinois in Galena\nAnd if you're listening to this and thinking like I Wonder if there's one near me you can always visit our website WWW dot senior housing companies dot com and we have a great a button now available I even cook the radio listener button and it'll show you a map of all of our communities and some of what we've talked about today\nAnd then also feel free to call me if you want to one eight hundred three six six sixty seven sixteen my name is Kelly and I can certainly help all I knew what the right community for your needs\nA especially coming into winter now you want to be careful to make this appointment early do your research early because you don't want to get caught with out in an apartment when the snow flies\nA if you're a farmer the back in the field right now and maybe he can be a little maybe your novel this is true not today but if you're listening to this and thinking gosh you know\nI'm going to be back in the field I'm going to be really busy I'm not going to be able to check in on mom or dad the way that I did all summer long and give us a call let's make that make that appointment before something bad happened\nThat sounds great and and and most all not as everything is the same so you have to check to see which type or how many facilities will meet your needs\n... and they've really done a great job of making sure that each community is tailored to the residents that live there so some offer independent living in memory care some offer ... homes independent living assisted living closer care and memory care so it really just depends\nOn the community itself so depending on what you need in your location I'm sure we can find the right fit for you or your loved\nOne you find that memory care is becoming more and more critical and and and people are taking advantage of that\nAbsolutely I our president Alan Philips always says that modern medicine has found a way to keep people live longer ah with with medications with surgical a interventions with healthy diet and exercise\nBut unfortunately nothing really keeps you from getting all the time or if they haven't figured that out yet so memory care is becoming more and more of a need\nI so pretty much every single one of our twenty six communities offers memory care for people with Alzheimer's and dementia\nWith programming that is truly helping them live a more full life so things that provide well rounded um daily activities and good communication with family so that they know that their loved ones not just sitting in in their apartment\nSo if people would would become field for some reason or another\nI can sit down to it like Apple's recently unveiled new Iowa as well springtime
