and all the safety switches and and ah you know a check for carbon monoxide all that good stuff\nAnd it's important that you get connected with somebody like Robby hardware to because then if you have a problem in the middle of the winner you might be yeah we're certainly there for our customers Internet absolutely so that's a good thing to anyway uh we um want to talk about a lot of things that are going on you sound Lennox yeah\nWe're ... and the sounds like they got the lines\nAre about ready to open up or just go going again I mean they got hit with the tornado there over in Marshall time which really gonna hurt a little bit with the uh getting products but I think that's going back on track right now and and uh you know I mean that's one thing I've always said is it you know rub the hardware buys from\nUh from Linux or one of the main reasons is the product that we're in stolen come right out of marsh ton island and support in a local uh Iowa economy and stuff's pretty important to\nAbsolutely so it's something that you want to talk about it and get some discounts\nAnd uh Lennox yeah running our own was going on through now through a toward the end of November\nI mean there's some great a great deal that's a great time to buy a combination furnace and air conditioning system you can get\nA Lenox rebates also on furnace on ... and stuff but a lot of times many grouped together is really your best deal a lion Madame one of the already sees all have a a nice incentives as well um you know on air conditioners and furnaces a\nIf there's so many of the gas and stuff so yeah it's a great time to to consider it I mean a gas furnace really like I said we should\nThey should be looked at inspected every year but you're expected to get you know anywhere from twelve to Eighteen years out of gas furnace so if it's getting that kind of age on it I strongly encourage people to and so a carbon monoxide detector is well that's just something that can can ah obviously prevent a catastrophe so\nWe'll see if we can take a phone call him and they have one for you this morning Joe will see they have a question for Jake Robbie\nYellow I\nWell I'm Sorry we're doing a

doing\nWell it's a national its its natural gas is that correct\nYet I think it's a big things I think at one time it was\nCold yeah probably was converted over that kind of thing\nYeah certainly and and that too has a you may not have a a a furnace on that for a gravity south system or they certainly have gas files and other safety's that should be checked a you know even though there isn't a blurring loaded on a gravity style\nSays no no no motors now and yet it right out yeah basically we should check make sure things aren't blocked we did have a a found a boiler this year that that the flu is blocked and there was a carbon monoxide issue and and so it's\nCertainly worth looking at and and investigating and make sure that everything's burning clean and proper for you\nKnow basically to check to have that things have not far yes okay well thank God [laughter]\nI think he was accomplish it that I should tell of folks the phone number three six five zero six hundred eight hundred

call here in the morning they have a question for Jake Ravi go ahead\nI'm my question is on um how does one go out and knowing a correct BTU foreigners to get for their place certainly also is there such a thing as too much\nBP you I Know a lot not not west BTU but if you get\nSomething as greater BTU then what are rated for is that okay\nRight well it's a good question to start with 'em to answer the first question would be to use and the seizing um manual J. lo calculations are the best for achieving the exact\nUh perfection for the proper ... to use um [noise] and we do low calculations on\nExcuse me every and solve that we do retrofit or new construction and and that takes into account the square foot of the home the insulation and our values the windows um the addict insulation all these things uh you know based on where we're at in the country here in Iowa\nI'm we can calculate exactly what we need for me to use as far as over seizing\nOver seizing a gas furnace um isn't a isn't a huge deal but the the temperature cycle of home uh it just it it won't equate to good comfort you know I'm\nThe big thing uh in my opinion is is\nWith over seizing some of the gas furnaces today like were installing are fully modulating and there's several furnaces out there that are to stage so in other words\nYou know fully modulating like a Lenox S P Ninety eight will modulate from anywhere of twenty percent of its total capacity clear up to a hundred percent so you really don't risk over seizing\nWhen we look at the to stage stuff you normally have a low fire and high fire therefore you don't have to really worry about over seizing it's there for you if you need it I'm probably the biggest mistake people make when when seizing is on the air conditioning side and that is also calculated on be to use the he gain of a home\nAnd if your ... and ac then it can get awful cold and climate 'cause it gets to temperature way too fast and does indeed humidifier that into\nYour question yes excellent thank you\nYes sir thank you as a call ... ... ... here and guess what we're right up to break already hey oh that was done by quick fired all day so well that's okay
