suspect you're killing the Saudi journalist in Turkey boxes Jerry ... live at the White House\nA does a lot of negative things is what it does um been seeing a lot of patience lately I've been kind of going around us and different opposite seeing patients I'm just helping out because we're\nYou know a little busy so helping out and uh the it's amazing how we can talk to an individual about what happens or why they're in their current situation\nAnd then have them look you and say well yeah you know I've got to think about it well you've been thinking about it for however many years you've struggled in situations for however many years you got the courage to make the call to come in and get your hearing checked and then it's wow okay uh I don't even think about\nAnd then you sit there and and you look at him and and you just you you asked the question of what didn't I explain correctly what didn't I what didn't I explain that you're not understanding and what I mean by that is\nThe longer you go without treating hearing loss the signals aren't getting to the brain the brain loses the ability to understand words [noise] I don't and it's not that I don't care it's just when we look at your audio Graham so when you push a button and the results in your graph\nThe audio grand just gives us a guideline\nWhat I care about is when we give you the words in heavy repeat them your word recognition scores in your speech annoys test that is more important than anything because that tells us if we treat your hearing loss with hearing aids\nDoes your brain is your brain going to understand what's coming through if your brain has lost understanding or speech recognition [noise]\nIt doesn't return so now by waiting now you're waiting longer you're letting the correct incorrect signals get to the brain the brain you you have the chance of reducing those scores even more\nI equate it to watching 'em if you have like direct TV or dish\nAnd it's storming outside and the TV goes in and out of the signal goes in and out that's what's going on with your brain your brain is getting a mixed signals your brain's not getting a fresh signal because you're not there is no way to get it there if you're not treating your hearing loss\nThe signal can't get there that there there's nothing to give it the signals getting broken signal the problem is our brain is use it or lose it\nSo if we're not if we're overloading our brain we're suffering and cognition\nSo our cognitive or it's a cognitive overload that makes your brain suffer long term that's where the the dimension link comes in your two to five times more likely to develop dementia by not treating your hearing loss and then people will say well I'm not old enough I don't care what a jar\n[noise] it doesn't matter I mean if you're fifty in your brain isn't functioning correctly because you're not treating hearing loss you're fifty\nBut I don't want to go to I don't want a war that hearing it sure look old\nHearing aids weren't designed for people at a certain age they weren't invented for someone at a certain age they were invented for a hearing loss ... why do we wear glasses mhm why do you wear glasses because you can see it's right what does that happen\nIt happened for me in fifth grade it wasn't an old it wasn't an old age thing I didn't look at my mom and say well I'm not old enough mom I'm I'm not old enough to wear glasses I looked at my mom and said well I Can't see she took me to the doctor and I got glasses why do you think coke Larry implants were invented\nMhm for babies that were born deaf\nIt wasn't for it wasn't for fifty five year old person that can't hear any more of the it was too stubborn to get hearing aids when they needed to and waited and now they have to get a call ... ... that's not what they were invented for\nWhat are the so tiny that you can barely see 'em anyway yeah and that's the amazing thing is every one I have yet to have any on two things one I have yet to have any one look at me and say wow those hearing interest do big\nFirst comment is wow they've really got small mhm well yeah you haven't seen a hearing aid and you know since you're great grandma had one at Thanksgiving Twenty years ago that ... and was big and bulky and well\nYeah I wouldn't want to wear that either but the technology now I'm actually saw a woman yesterday I think she's I Want to say she's in her fifties but I Can't remember age of time and she was I mean she was younger um and\nI explained to her what the new technology does how it can next year I ... and not just even your iPhone that we actually have aids connect directly to your Android or iPhone and she looked at me she said I can listen to music through my hearing aids said yeah so that's what the technology does now\nThe other is I've never had anyone look at me and say I wish I would've done is it's always I Wish I would've done this five ten years ago because I didn't know what I was missing\nAnd that's the thing is you don't know what you're missing 'cause you're normal now is where you're hearing loss is so for your brain that your new normal\nNot normal for Twenty years ago it's normal of where you live now and it's like taking the radio and turning down the volume one notch every year doesn't seem like a whole lot year after year but after like ten years it's a lot of notches mhm so now but it's but it's what you're accustomed to now so you really don't know\nUntil you treat your hearing loss but people have to get over this there's an age thing or I can wait till I Want to get hearing aids and everything will be find it won't the number one complaint people have\nIs they expected way too much of the hearing aids mhm and it's not the hearing aids can't do it when we have ... I mean we have technology now that is unbelievable\nIt's because the brain can't process you're asking your brain to do something it can't do anymore do people put off than making an appointment to come in and all the time ... it happens every day I mean I I guarantee there are thousands of people listening right now that\nHave put it off they murdered off put it off but it off I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it next year I'll do when I'm ready or I'll do it you know when I Can't hear any more well that's all fine and good but you're you're causing your brain to suffer\nAnd it's not ... it's out of our control when the brain loses it it doesn't return it doesn't come back it's not something that like by wearing hearing aids and now you have to have good speech understanding when we fit you in order for it to be successful to truly successful so how do we encourage them to do that what can you get for him\nSo anyone that calls and books are limited by one PM today\nYou will by the by one concept recharge S.
