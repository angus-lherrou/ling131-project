Minnesota\nDon't want to ears are and just saying that saying alright tomorrow I'm doing I'm doing the dog wagging her shift I'm going to be doing the uh Easter Avalon and garden show tomorrow and then we got the uh\nNot necessarily those have WMD or I heart media\nThe morning and welcome to ask the expert on six hundred WMD Jim doing along with most of Johnson from frontier futures\nAnd uh she's here to talk about what's happening there and how we can do a little speculation here and there I well I don't know about that oh okay we're here to talk about hedging Hendrik okay hedging yeah and tell me about it do what is it just just started during which ones\nDo I'm I'm with frontier features as you just said and uh we're we're\nA company here in town and I've been here every couple of months and kind of my mission I guess as to [noise]\nUm explain what a full service broker does\nI'm really trying hard to kind of flip the switch on any fear you have of calling a broker working with the broker I think\nAny more people get so nervous to get wrapped up with somebody that might not have their best interest in minds and things of that nature so\nAgain just kind of keep pushing the um education avenue of all of this stuff um and knowing that that using the futures market and options markets\nUm doesn't have to be a scary thing right right so I'm here today just to kind of talk a little bit more about that we've got our full service division with um numerous brokers around um to help people out\nAnd I'm just talk about the markets a little bit and then also kind of what we do what the process looks like when you finally are like okay I Can't do everything on my own um especially right now\nI I kind of was thinking I Would come in today talking to people that would be on a combines but I'm not entirely sure that's the case [laughter] among other things we don't have the best weather outlook for the next week so\nUm I guess that will be my challenge when it's raining take a few minutes give give your operation the attention that deserves here and uh\nIf you want a little help or just have some questions I promise it's you're not going to get wrapped up into deep with stuff you don't know but um you know it doesn't hurt to education educate yourself a little bit um and just kind of see what we can do to help you out so\nI'm basically what what we would do is um our our big thing is have a plan bottom line have\nA plan um you know flying by the seat of your pants margins are small anymore with stuff it just it it's really important that\nIf if I Can't stress anything more than that but just kind of looking at things now and as we do approach the next week and there's rain and and you maybe have a little more time to spend to spend with your books um there's a couple of things that um\nI wanted to kind of focus on today [laughter] um again back to where we kind of started with this the futures market is just at the very basic of what it is is an opportunity to be able to price crops in the future right\nSo if we you know in my office I've got a quote screen that goes all the way through you know the next couple of years so each month to see a price posted and that's what the prices in Chicago\nSo we can actually price corn\nFor next year and we're talking about corn that there are still other Cornyn its way it's not in the ground and [laughter] you know what I mean this is a far way off\nHowever um the big the big components of this and and I was kind of explaining this to you before too is what we call Carrie [laughter] so right now we have a price where corn is right now and we have a price record is next December\nAll in the world would they know that well so based on the futures prices right now we can ... the Kerry price that factors in storage and interest costs so in a normal market the prices for a year from now are going to be higher than they are right now [noise]\nAnd every everything I ever say there's an strict on it because there's always [laughter] example of you know there's the inverse market things like that but right now we're in a normal market so the prices in two thousand Nineteen corn\nAre higher than where they are right now so basically what we're what we're saying is take a look right now at there's a couple a couple of big factors storage is a big on\nUm we've got and and this is especially true with soybeans with prices that maybe aren't as favorable I think you're going to see more farmers story beans this year than normally do [noise]\nUm you know you've got the prospect coming up of okay do we ... do we plant left beans next year because of the prices do we plant more corn\nYou know all of these factors that it's really hard for us to say right now where we're sitting right now what exactly is going to happen but we know there's a couple of different scenarios so when you come in and we we start to look at\nYour break even prices um your basis levels and that's the other thing that kind of one of the chat a little bit I Know we've covered basis before when I've been here um and I I Do feel like basis is something that a lot of\nProducers have a a decent handle on that's the difference between your cash price and the futures price and that's that's what the basis as I'm so using the futures market you're able to actually priced things out into the future and this is something that um again it's sometimes hard for people to\nGrasp the idea maybe of pricing something further out um but that's also what what you can come to my office we sit down and kind of write it all down figure it all out and everybody has their own levels of risk tolerance and um what they want to do what they understand all that kinda stuff so\nThey do they always try to do all of their crop or to do some of their crop or or or how does that work\nI think that um I I don't think it would be anybody's um in anybody's best interest to do everything all at once right especially now when you're looking into the future ... the main reason is because we don't know what all of it is [laughter]\nI don't know what all of our crop is due to do that I was in Nineteen Ninety thousand twenty right right so when your hedging you're never hygiene\nA hundred percent necessarily because we don't know what we don't even know what that is right now for two thousand Eighteen 'cause we just we don't have the crops out of the fields yet so I'm you know I can on the crops onto the field once we get there\nI'm well that's what you know the U.S the reports come out and that's you know that's why those are always such a big deal because those are the numbers that it's like OK here's where we're at\nBut then the USDA numbers come out and you hear people say well that's not true because in my yard the ... you know what I mean so it's yeah you have you have a better idea and as the weeks pass on here and harvest gets more underway we kind of have a better idea how things are going\nUm but I mean we're looking at at a record yields you know so there's a um a lot of news coming up\nI'm mid term elections are coming up I'm again just with harvest getting underway we don't really know what what effect whether it's going to have on everything going on\nSo there's just there's arguments to the bowl side there's arguments to the barest side um and you're like well you're not much help well the hope is not necessarily that I Know the future that I Know what's going to happen but the help that we can provide it frontier is\nSitting down and making a plan so that when things do come up when opportunities arise you're prepared to take advantage of those\nNow we have to take a break for me to do that let's talk about where they get a hold of you sure more detailed information on their own particular situation okay\nUh you can call her office or number at the offices eight hundred seven seven seven to for three eight we have a website full service press dot com we also have a Facebook page so there's multiple ways to get a hold of us and again no pressure just shoot us a question if you have one and we'd be happy to talk\nWith the regular most injunction a cheer from frontier futures we're going to talk more with her and just a moment you're listening to us the expert on six hundred WMD when\nWhen one thousand dollar lottery
