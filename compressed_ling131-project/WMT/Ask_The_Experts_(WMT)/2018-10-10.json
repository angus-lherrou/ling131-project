M. T. Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nNews alerts hurricane Michael is hammering the Florida Panhandle unleashed the Brady now close to a category ... storm as it approaches landfall Fox has brown tracking it live from Miami\nWe do women's only classes as well as the one we have on a week from Saturday this fall but we have another one schedule for November ... another in December\nWe do basic hang on classes every week we call them pull the trigger it's we it's a foreperson class so it's a one one instructor for people\nWho never fired a gun before we can start with no knowledge and get your shooting in a few hours and ... as a winner progress is a little bit more advanced class how to draw from a holster a more intermediate level classes that will be offering as the as the weather turns\nThat's and that's interesting and most people they shouldn't just can they buy a gun without taking one of the classes\nSure you can purchase a gun so you need a permit to carry or a permit to acquire in order to purchase a handgun\nIn order to that counts as a background check entered purchased a rifle or a shock on yet to be Eighteen years old\nAnd we run a ex FBI background check on you know it's called the Knicks jak most people takes a few minutes someone might take a day or so to return but again it's the vast majority of people it's just a few minutes and the ... the background jug we run and you can take the gun him\nBut I could come in and and I can actually apply to buy a gun so long gun yes all rifle shotgun but not in not in so I I'm I'm unless I take a class I'm done\nSo now you can take a you can get a permit to acquire okay at the Fred to acquire you have to go to a lower your county sheriff and just pay him whatever their fears that thing of Linn county is twenty dollars and\nThey'll run a background check on you and mailed a permit to acquire to you in a ten days or so and then you bring that permit and and that will count as your background check and allow you to buy a handgun\nBut also light than take the class do it or not you don't need a permit to save the class knowing too well but that's the idea behind the class wouldn't that be yeah the the classes for the\nPermit to carry the permit to acquire is just allows you to buy a gun permit to carry allows you to purchase a gun and but it also allows you to care of the gun in public\nMhm so what what do you see the most as far as purchasing guns from you you see more long guns being sold or do you see more hand guns being sold way more handguns and that's do you think that's because of the atmosphere out there now no I think\nYou know and actually since two thousand sixteen the gun sales and the gun market as this plummeted you know it's been we've we've seen industry why we've seen a stark decrease in gun sales in ... and decrease in the growth of of the sales\nPeople buy guns for different reasons and if you break that down between male and female the number one reasons that females buy guns for self defense or nationally as well over eighty percent of women who are buying guns for the first time or buying it for self defense or home defense\nMen it's it's a little bit different as well the top reason for men purchasing guns or some sort of social aspect it could be hunting and that could be just target shooting sports shooting [noise] there's a lot of places that there were groups come in and they shoot at lunch hour\n[laughter] so it's a [noise] men purchase more for social activity and then what they do for self defense and the second one man is is self defense\nBut [noise] the more people the\nNumber of people who own guns anymore that shoot that hunt is very small you know the the hunting hunting population as decrease pretty dramatically over the last generation and so the vast majority of people who own guns by him to shoot or they buy from the home defense so it's a little bit different customer than what it was you know maybe Twenty years ago\nThey now is there anything starting now as far as hunting season is concerned or when does it start well\nThe most ... the early ... and start Saturday\nAs the fourteenth I Believe is the early ... and what's that mean so you can it's a\nThe\nEarly season ... was a Muslim as a Muslim or your loan through the uh instead of the limits of the bridge low to the Muslim barrel ... white powder\nAnd we do have actually rented a sale and black powder guns right now but we have a handful black powder guns left and where it's a seasonal item for us so more twenty five percent off all of our white powder supplies\nSwitches patches and clean and gets ... and that kind of thing we have I think four or five black powder rifles leftover that that were given a real deep discount on\nAs a very popular or do they more or less go for the different type of gun\nA black powder is not as popular as as just normal handguns shooting a rifle shooting and they limit the number of tags and this early season and I think if I'd be pretty tough on him because you know there's so much Cornell with a wet weather we've had yes have you know the deer are going to be in the in the cornfields\nAnd there's plenty of 'em that seems like any way at least they're they're in town probably protecting themselves is that the idea\nThat or I don't know that they protect themselves because man I have a big SUV and they like to stand right in front of it\n[laughter] do you have a deer horn nope I don't I'm [laughter] I'm not too sympathetic when they stand in the way you look out
