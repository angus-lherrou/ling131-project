friends from Cedar Rapids police departments city council wants to see why not with us as well we have always ended the segment end of the hour with things that are upcoming\nWhen you treated you're hearing loss\nSo that's huge that tells you right there that by wearing hearing aids\nIt is it is helping your brain is getting a signal and so basically hearing aids are giving your years back what you're missing and giving your brain it means\nWhat to make sense of and how to make sense of what is coming through so it just has to be the correct signal a cheaper hearing aids someplace you know that as\nWell as maybe state of the art maybe it's not you know I'm going with not and well and what they call state of the art as well or at least they they aren't as the Internet and gets to you can put a lot of information on the Internet\nDoesn't mean it's right it just means that state it that's all the Internet really really means is that state and information doesn't mean is right\nAnd we see it all the time and in the hearing industry that people will put state of the art get what you're you know hear what you've been missing here I'm\nA correct you know using definitive words and then hearing loss you can't use definitive I mean it's just it's not definitive everybody has a different hearing loss\nDifferent thresholds um different speech and no I mean there are so many factors that go into hearing loss so if you think that you can self diagnose or you can go to a um big box store or you can go to a pharmacy or somewhere\nAnd walk in and just pick something off the shelf or say oh go on the Internet and say oh yeah this is what I Need I had a gentleman actually call me a couple of days ago and said what price on your best hearing it\nAnd I had to ask some questions because we'll one why do you want the best I mean there's got to be a reason um have you had your hand checked ... what are what are you comparing it to\nAnd there's so many factors that go into understanding what are you hearing loss is\nWhat it means to be treated but then realistic expectations if you think that\nOne when we do the hearing test we you know it's the the first part is you know you you here sounds you push the button that tells me what your true hearing loss is\nWell there's a hearing aid we have a hearing it it can work with any hearing loss so it's we can look at that age and say okay this kind of gives us the guidelines\nThe part of the tests that is the most impactful is your direct word recognition scores so if I give you words and you repeat the words back and your scores on a hundred percent you are losing speech understanding now the issue is\nEven with hearing aids if your speech understanding is diminished it'll never return so if your scores aren't a hundred percent you'll never have a hundred percent again ever you can't make the brain\nUnderstand or to learn what it is lost our brain is use it or lose it when it comes to speech understanding and that's what's so many people\nAte take for granted and be think that\nOh if I get hearing aids everything will be great will know your the worse your scores the harder it is for an individual to get adjusted to wearing hearing aids and it's because we're ... we're trying to wipe away whatever time frame that is so if you've had a hearing loss for Fifteen Twenty years [laughter]\nYour world is completely different than it was when you had normal here and you're just used to it in its current form when he put hearing aids on it's like you it's like he racing Twenty years in sound and people will sail you know there's all these things when I don't find it used to that well\nYou were used to it at one point in time you had normal hearing introduce you let your hearing deteriorate so far been now it's an adjustment period everybody adjusts differently some people can put hearing aids walk out the door and do phenomenal\nA lot of it as a state of mind you have to be willing to accept you have a hearing loss and the only way to treat your sensory neuron hearing loss which is the majority of hearing loss is today\nIs what the ... that the only way you can do it there isn't anything else it's going to correct or work with your hearing loss surgery can't fix a century neural hearing loss there isn't some magic pill\nTime doesn't cure it there there's no cure I mean it's like with glasses what is the what's the cure for poor vision\nClasses are contacts Mitch corrective vision I mean it's corrective lenses that's what it is the same thing with hearing loss it's corrective hearing ... and that's the only way we can do it and\nThinking that you know you can go on the Internet and find something cheap or something cheaper remember you still have to get it surface you still have to get it programmed you still have to get the follow up care and when you buy it off the Internet\nConcept isn't the place you're going to come you don't get to come to concept and say oh I bought these off the Internet can you hear and and to me well now you know now go find go find the place that old you know what about the place you bought 'em from oh they're out of where California Utah where I mean where are you buying from\nI'm understanding what you're buying and when you're buying or purchasing hearing aids you're purchasing a a lifestyle\nBe all the follow up care that is what you're purchasing\nIn a concept all the follow up here is include\nThe sitting down with your dispenser face to face why you're wearing your hearing aids and making the changes while you're wearing them to hear [noise] do I like the changes do I not like the changes do we need a little bit more a little bit less but you're doing it face to face right now\nWearing your hearing aids and there are places out there the big box stores are doing drop officer is now so you don't get to see anyone you don't get to sit down face to face with your provider\nUm pharmacies are doing the same thing there's pharmacies out there that you know\nYou can purchase something in an over the Internet that is ... that is exactly what you're purchasing is you're you're not purchasing anything for what one doesn't work writer something is wrong with that will get so where you bought it what what are they going to do for you you're going to mail it back to him at concept you're walking and bring it to us we either can fix it in the office or we have to send it in for a pair\nBut in most cases you can probably even get a loner while you're in a while your other ones going just depends upon if we have any you know any in or not but I'm all of that is so important that people take for granted and it's because they're looking for a cheaper option\nAnd cheaper\nThere I've never ever experience cheaper being better ... no matter what I bought cheaper has never worked out in the long run it saves you money up front but you always get stuck in the end you know I and you know you always try to encourage people to get their hearing that there's it's important\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bad we sleep in to the raid that we use when we wake up but we've neglected one of the more impulsive products\nWith only a kite husky and what hamstring", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "25"}
