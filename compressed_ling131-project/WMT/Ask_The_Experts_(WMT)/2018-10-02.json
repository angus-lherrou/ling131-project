live in Washington\nSounds like sounds like fun I can do you do you go to clubs and organizations things better ...\nLots of different um groups and things like that um I usually end up I'm speaking with a more of our um senior population is is a kind of where I where I tend to end up maybe some of some vets um because our services are covered by\nI'm veteran benefits um so sometimes um I have those kinds of groups as well so\nWell and a lot of not everybody does a home health care like you do write and uh so everybody has their little uh you know in an ... or what I've heard and what I've seen is you're going to like twenty four hours a day seven days a week or you know\nYeah yeah Julie likes to cost purple cow I'm we're kind of the whole we're kind of the whole package um and so what that means is that we have two sides of our company we've got our private side and we have our Medicare side\nI'm On the private side we do our personal care is in our home making services and on that Medicare site is where we usually have our clients uh who need skilled nursing or physical speech occupational therapy\nYou know we're going to talk about both of those things gone by the private side for some people uh when you're out on your little visits more heavy kind of talk about the fact that they think that well uh I just can't call or a too expensive for sure you know things that would be good questions like that\nAll the time yes I Do I hear I all the time that oh I'm I'm not old enough for that yet or I don't need that kind of thing yet or um does my doctor need to call you then or how does that work um and really the answer is a home cares for anybody of any age um if you just need a little help around the house\nOr that's what we're there for and we it's really a preventative thing is how I like to a present it to people because\nUm you know you don't want to get to the point where maybe your laundries in the basement and you're trying to walk down the stairs with that big old basket full of clothes and you fall and then you end up needing you know going to a nursing home and needing services and so on and so forth\nWe want to prevent that from happening in the first place so that you can stay independent for as long as possible so it's really a preventative measure when you go and um higher home a home care aide for yourself\nUm to make sure that you don't end up getting any worse any faster than you have to you know um [noise] so I I like to really present it that way\nUm the other thing is I'm On our private side you you do not have to have a doctor's orders it's as easy as you picking up the phone and given us a call so um we've got lots of holidays here Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up and um\nYou know sometimes we'll get a actually a lot of times around the holidays we get 'em sons and daughters calling us and saying oh\nYou know we're at mom's first Thanksgiving and she's just not doing as well as she was and I was wondering about your services\nAnd what we like to um really urge some of our seniors is is for you to pick up and and just\nCause yourself you know call us and have come in um will make sure you're doing well for one your sons and your daughters come home for the holidays to see ya um and so they don't have to worry about you and you don't have to worry about a lot of the things that maybe you you kinda think maybe I shouldn't be doing this anymore\nWe Ralphie without something or you don't have to have every day or something like that and and uh you can have it maybe two or three times a week or once once a week for that matter right right and only for an hour yup\nYup very individualized in that way we set our schedules work with you to set those schedules so that you know what to expect to no end to expect us to come see ya\nI'm maybe you only want us you know once a week for an hour maybe you want us five times a week for you know two or three hours and that's fine we can make we can make those times work I'm\n... and that's something that I I really like to point out to people as they are looking and shopping around for different home cares as you'll notice that some of them some of us will charge 'em\nWill charge a certain amount per hour but but they might have a two three four hour minimum so I'm no matter how much work that home care aid comes and does maybe she's only there for an hour\nUm you're gonna get charged for those four hours so it's something to do something to look for and really\nYou know if if all these little help out around the house or maybe you just need to run and get some groceries once a week or something like that really that's the thing we can get that done in an hour or so\nUm that's just kind of something something to look out for is um you know how what is that hourly minimum and um what are they going to charge you for for a visit like that\nYou do some ... or or you know some light housekeeping ... uh and cooking and may be freezing some stuff for the folks in the nature\nYup yup we can do um so our our housekeeping services um we do we do light housekeeping I'm so we can't come and do like a deep clean or anything like that um but we can come help you make sure you know the kitchen and everything's nice and cleaned up um\nMake sure that you're getting your meals um sometimes they'll make meals and uh you know maybe make a lasagna and I'm Free some of it for us so that you're able to pull it out for lunch or dinner or whenever you need to for the rest of the week um\nWe can do that kind of thing um we can come and just remind you to take your medications if maybe you're having a hard time remembering\n'em to take those um we even have a morning at an early riser service and then we have our evening tuck in services as well ah where we can come and make sure that you that you get out of bed and you know sometimes you can get a little light headed when you go to stand up for the first time in the morning again preventative we want to prevent those false\nUm gets you into the shower and make sure that you're ready for the day\nUm and then we can do kind of the reverse of that in the evening if if um that's something that you would like it just to someone to make sure that you get get into bed and um that you get up in the morning and get going for the day\nWhen someone calls you and says gee you know as I Would like to have your services more have you do a free assessment than no\nThat's right yes that's right um we do all of our ah for all of our private um site clients what's going to happen is if you do you know you think oh this might be kind of a helpful little thing for me to have\nUm what happens is one of our case managers\nUm they're all they're registered nurses one of our nurses will come out and meet with you and she's going to talk with you about all of the different things that that you might need\nAnd um you know you might say well I don't need I don't need this and that and whatever I just want you know maybe some laundry some laundry assistance and maybe some you know perhaps\nUm and it's as simple as that and she'll set that up with you should let your let you know what that's going to cost ya\nI'm and she'll work with you to make sure that you're um you're getting your needs and and um your needs are met and that you're you know paying what you want to for him\nAnd if you have to go to the doctor who you're maybe even take him to the doctors I correct\nSure yup yup we can have you know if maybe you want to a a separate set of years there with you our something we can uh one of our home care aides or we do we can take you to the doctor we can take you I'm like I said to the grocery store if you need a little help in and out of the grocery store we can go help you do that um we can even go for ya\nI'm you know anything like that um we we get those kinds of things set up and I'm scheduled it that that free initial assessment and I'm\nKind of go from there it works out really quite nice ... after news called yes it's as easy as that is really really that simple and went to a phone number yet so I'm the numbers through a nine to nine four three five to seven and you can call us anytime of the day we're we're on call twenty four hours a day seven days a week\nUm and it's going to be somebody like myself I'm or office manager or something like that
