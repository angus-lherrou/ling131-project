those are the host guests and callers and not necessarily those of WAMC or high hearted media muggy morning and welcome to ask\nThe expert on six hundred WMD I'm Jim and going along with Dr Jay Jay hang from Blue Ridge gentle he's oppressed and honest and that means\nI Am I a dentist who have gone to extra training and dental prosthetic such as dentures partial or dental and plants um so I was three years after dental school had an additional residency program for them\nSo you get called in when things are kind of funny and you don't know quite what to do next is\nA more complex things correct yeah yeah well that was another way of putting it [laughter] anyway but\nYou get into bridges in dentures and and like seeing plants and things of that nature as Eric\nCorrect that's a that's primarily um um my specialty is the prosthetic are they um like a prosthetic head and neck whether that's a chief gum tissue stuff like that as replacements no\nNow is there is there any uh as a thing that stands out in your mind and what you had to work on don't give any names or anything but something buddies that you worked on this really straighten things out for it because everybody wants to a decent smile today and they want to look good and and that seems to me is the thing right\nYeah I think the thing that sticks out most to me is when a person has a more and more recently has come in with their teeth significantly worn down well that's just been the thing that happens a lot of times people are either Clinton or grinding or\nSometimes even the type of food that they are eating they'll wear down and there's two different layers of to structure there's the enamel which is the outside and it's very hard structure\nUm and then you get to the inside of a person has worn down into that inside layer of tooth which is that and\nThat's a little softer material so people can wear that down even faster so that would be the thing that sticks out more recently as a patient coming in with their all their teeth kind of worn down over time something that happens a little over a little bit each day\nUm and then we're ... putting crowds are caps on all these teeth and rebuilding them up to where they once were and that's a it's a it's it's a very precise process that takes a lot of time to do it but very worthwhile for patients\nAbsolutely show and a lot of times you make your own problems too don't you\nCorrect um if it's a couple of single single too there are a couple of ... can do that um with um\nThe machine that can be done same day or something like that when you're talking about doing all the teeth at at once or multiple teeth that are involved um sometimes it's a little bit better to take a little bit different steps different approach a just a Ben's on the complexity of it all\nThat sort of machine does you know a really help you out as far as getting something maybe one or two done in time and then they don't have to come back or if they do I at least\nAs it's it's been great just because a dentist is an hour is not always people favorite place to go so [laughter]\nYeah no shocking right [laughter] so uh it's nice for them to come to one time get it done uh especially with it today with everyone's always busy holiday season coming up here too so gotta get a lot of soft on I'm\nTrying to rush into that a little bit because a lot of people have some dental insurance I haven't used and you find that you probably get really busy toward the end of the year which we are almost at the end of the year\nYeah so if this last two months just seems to be from a dental standpoint a whirlwind because everyone's trying to utilize their insurance\nSo if you have insurance getting then sooner is better we do occasionally get a phone call that last week of December or saying they have the people need to maximize their insurance benefits\nAnd trying to get booked in theirs is kind of like winning the lottery just because some people have this stuff planned out months ahead of time using using a there a time period right now to plan out hey I Want to have this done um so getting booked in there so the ... is very difficult those last couple of weeks\nWhen you're working to on a getting a few more high genesis involved is that correct so that might solve some of your problem\nCorrect that we ... we have a a couple more Hi Jen is on board to help get those ... patients in the door so they're not having to wait I'm so and then we also have a um a new assistant on board to help maximize the people's um time periods\nAnd attributes I as a precedent if you do a normal dentistry a regular day to day dentistry as well do you not\nI mean that's what's unique about my specialty is I'm able to do that", "show_name": "Ask The Experts
