A. S. F. always read the follow label directions [noise]\nSix hungry W. M. T.\nWelcome back to ask the expert on six and a W empty and yeah we're having a good\nTime whereas the movie is hey you know light of the TV and anyway we have a radio no nah that's from a tribal leaders destinations unlimited luring neither chair and so is a um a ... Alex Jasper\nWhere you have you been by the way I meant to ask you where are you been on a couple of trial and I apologize I been gone for a month and in fact I didn't even recognize Alex when I came back so I was in a week in Cape Cod and then I was back for four days and then a candidate New England cruise around and pat gander who's though always wonderful spend time with her on a path so we had a great time so\nSounds great beautiful area up there now you're going to tell us a little bit more about the Alaskan cruise for next year and maybe go down for spring training exactly\nSo yeah our is gonna be twenty six year doing our Alaska trip now a W empty a it's going to be June sixth through the twenty first of next year\nSo we start out by flying into fair banks and we do a week of touring the land portion of Alaska so we'll get to do Denali where we get a chance to do it to her up Denali national park which I think is one of probably the one main three highlights I'd say if not number one you get to see a bunch of wildlife there between the bears the mood I mean really\nAnything you can see it's pretty great to see\nA then we make our way to McKinley where you'll get the chance to see mount Denali as long as the the clouds are nice to you which it's nice because it's daylight almost the entire time there so you do get a chance as long as you're willing to step a little weight\nThen we make our way to ... where we get a chance to do an optional flow to her as well as the Kenai Peninsula\nUm I've done that before I'd say that probably definitely one of the highlights to um the year I when I think we stopped counting about like Ninety five bald eagles that we saw during the tour my goodness yes all a little baby bear that was a\nMessing around with some fishermen trying to take their fish or they didn't seem to be too concerned which I guess that's the difference between Alaska and Cedar Rapids [laughter]\nYeah and then after Keene I uh well actually embark on the ship where we do a week of cruising\nOr you'll get the chance to see Hubbard Glacier a Glacier National park which\nI'm Laurie saw last year yeah you know to kind of same thing not a bad picture you can take their during that at all or would do gag way we get to do a bus tour of the city um gold mining towns that you get to learn about the history of that as well\nOr Juno where will do will watching which I'd say if Denali national\nParks not the number one highlights probably whale watching and I'm just seeing a something that is as big as the boat here and right up next it's kinda flipping out of the water\nYeah something different definitely and then are we going to stop and catch it can which is going to be the last\nOr we stop and uh before we have one last day of cruising where we didn't bark and Vancouver will we will have two days to spend in Vancouver\nUh one of which we will two were um use our gardens and I'm myself I'm not huge into flowers already knows that but um I even enjoy that I have to admit that I even enjoy that and I was not a disappointed that I went there and all\nThat are are they ... they rarely as when you think that they've transform that into just beautiful garden yeah\nAnd that's so after that we've we fly home and so that's the tour like I said June sixth through the twenty first we do have space still so if you are interested I feel free to give us a call three one nine three nine three one two three five nine\nYou try to change this a little bit every or don't you\nIt just a little bit yeah we did we did this I Can't very last year and it was very popular it's kind of nice doing the land first and then cruising later because the beginning you are well first of all your eggs and it's a study of vacation you've got tons of energy and you can't wait to see everything and\nAnd um and the two sides of that are are just so completely different I mean are they doing the land and then doing the crews that you see\nYou know Alex had done it twice before and uh I had done the Kurdish but I'd never done the land portion and when he talked about you know this eight hour motor coach type thing I'm thinking oh my gosh that's going to be a long time well it isn't because you think of eight hours but it at the time flies I mean the bears they\nI was shocked when the bears just walked right along and they I mean they don't\nKnow and and you could see the mommy beer was out there with her two little babies and the two little babies wandered away and she whipped her head around and said something to them and they came margin right back and you're you can just picture like you know over here right now where if you're taking your pitcher get over here\nAnd uh they you know kind of just took their own sweet time walking in the road and um we had to stop that's their road and uh and that was to take a picture of 'em and and they're just wonderful it's just absolutely beautiful and\nAnd I I think we were in the same all when we when you see the whales and they're like you said flipping out of the water and twirling and slapping and or not eating and roll\nYeah more to know what they call and who do they talk to and what's going on was the the ...\nOr you can call either one of us either Laurie are Alex at three nine three one three five nine and get a brochure will get that out to you right away and get you signed up so yeah there we've never had never had a disappointment it's it's just absolutely beautiful and a lot of fun to watch the debates on there\nA gym six the twenty first of twenty nine\nAnd of course the same phone number you would use if you would like to go to spring training and see the cubs are actually\nYeah in March of next year from the Seventeen through the twenty second will be doing a cubs spring training trip a get a chance to visit the Phoenix area as well as the to spring training game so\nThere are only about ...

Cedar Rapids and I hard radio station [noise]\nPressure on Saudi Arabia on the ... the CIA chief now in Turkey which released an update on the killing of a Saudi journalist today Fox assignment on one with this lies\nBut I don't think folks in Washington D. C. understand that if we see continued low prices that's gonna mean pain and suffering and all of our small towns all those small businesses on home farmers depend on and who farmers depend\nA if if we have continued if we if we feel an extended soft period around of bankers were nervous we're going to have\nA small town car dealerships you're nervous routes schools and churches are going to see fewer people are in the bleachers on friday night and fewer people in the pews on Sunday mornings and that's not what I Want to see so we've got to think make sure that Washington DC understands what the waivers they've been handing out\nOil refiners in biofuels policy uh it's been keeping prices for corn and beans down and with what's gone and trade I don't think we've had a a coherent strategy to really take on\nThe bad actions of China you know if we had rallied our allies are the Europeans the Japanese Canadians Mexicans other folks who are of like mind in terms of China's\nA problems uh now I think we would have had a lot more success you know it's it's really concerning because we've seen obviously low prices\nDue to what's going on and trade but what concerns me even more is the fact that we might lose those markets are our you know spent those eight years at USDA ... lotta crop briefings\nAnd that time about how weather in the southern hemisphere impacts prices and demand and supply in the northern hemisphere never wants to hear the words Russia and soybeans using the same sentence but in June after they put\nTariffs on our beans or one of the headlines out there was China to source record supply of beans from Russia\nOr those export markets are important but we've also then got to make sure we're figuring out what are those next generation uses of what we growing race so we can continue to add value and create new jobs and industries in rural Iowa\nThank you Jim Jim Ghana by the way I Would be remiss if I did not a big say ... to the folks at my record Iowa corner sponsor a during in the presentation today my next secretary of agriculture a Republican candidate might\nBomb an Indian Doug good to be with you are\nAlways fun to be on the big show and and uh you couldn't think of a better place to do this uh this was the last four I'm here before the election and then on the big show and so thank you thanks to those of you here today and\nAnd for all of you listening or out across the state of Iowa today as well we know a lot of folks and ... and tractors and trucks that are out there working hard you know we we got a a saw some tremendous progress here last week the weather finally turned and held a thirty seven percent soybean harvest which is still twelve days behind the average\nUh twenty nine percent of the corn harvest and which is about four days behind the average so uh you know we're still running behind but uh I Know that folks are working awfully hard had a chance to travel up through\nNorth central Iowa in western Iowa yesterday I saw a heck of a lot of means coming out so uh uh we know that are over the next few days we'll we'll we'll continue to see quite a bit of progress\nWell it's a it's just a ... been an absolute a tremendous honor to have had the opportunity to last seven months to serve as the secretary of agriculture the state in the I think first and foremost would I Would want folks to know\nAnd all of you listening out there all of you involved in in agriculture and that's the to what I've done every day is get up go to work on your behalf\nTrying to fight for this agriculture trying to promote this agriculture and and you know we know that there are some challenges out there some issues right now that need to be addressed and we need to see progress on trade and talk about that here and a little bit and\nAnd we need to make progress on water quality and soil health and talk about that too um but I think we're moving in the right direction but again it's a it's a tremendous honor to be able to serve so\nI grew up in northwest Iowa a we have a century farm my great grandfather bought that farm in Nineteen oh too I was just up by this past weekend helping finally with some of that so I mean harvest that we were anxious to get done\nAnd I'm you know I'm raising my wife and I are raising the fifth generation of our family to be involved in that operation in fact I was taking my youngest to daycare this morning and he asked if we were going to the farm today so unfortunately I broke his little heart said no we're\nWe're having to stay here but uh but uh you know they enjoy being up there and involved in that in that operation as well\nI tell you that you know I like to say this God made Iowa for agriculture and you know you don't have to look very far across our great state to see how incredibly productive we are looking at our statistics look at where Iowa\nRanks in terms of our our production in uh in corn and soybean and pork and eggs and bio diesel and ethanol in this country and we're known globally for that production and the quality of our our products are but we can't take that for granted you know it does matter\nOf who we send to represent us who it who we send to work on our behalf\nUh we've got to ensure that we have policies that allow for the conditions for success and agriculture\nWe've got to ensure that we have a regulatory environment that allows her farmers in our businesses to grow and thrive\nInto so it doesn't matter who you send to work on your behalf so the things that I'm I'm thinking about and I hear a lot of bad as they travel the state and again I Know we'll we'll dig into these things deeper throughout the day here but I'm I'm markets for our products both international and domestic you know making sure that we can export our products are holding our trading partners accountable\nTo that we've got the message of domestic markets like livestock and renewable fuels are things that we can take our commodity agriculture and turn that into something of higher value\nWe've got to make sure that when our economy is based on agriculture and our agriculture is built on our natural resources that were doing the right things from soil health and water quality standpoint and the final piece is is all about workforce here this top of mind for folks when I travel to state\nMaking sure we've got the talent pipeline to supply the workforce of today and also the workforce that we know that we all need tomorrow so\nAnd these are the things that I'm I'm working on every day and the things that we will work on and I find that have a chance to serve a full term here as secretary of agriculture so again thank you uh for hosting this uh this forum today and I look forward to a great discussion\nOr Mike Mike neck thank you so much again a big thank you going out to Iowa corn for helping us the hostess presentation today my name is Bob when Andy Peterson to the big show dogs going to be coming up here a little bit with the markets and whether as well for those of you joined again\nThis is our secretary of agriculture forum today and the guys on the give you about a minute and a half years will minute and a half Andy we'll talk a little bit\nUh ... throughout a question for about a Ninety seconds or so what would you say the number one issue is facing a that you would face a secretary of agriculture\nI think number one issue is profitability we've had declining farm income for five in the last six years\nUSDA a predicted it was going to fall again this year back in February before we started\nThe uh trade disputes with multiple trading partners so I think the the number one issue is short term getting Washington DC to fix what has been a bad biofuels and bad trade policy for Iowa farmers are and then longer term we've got to invest in the kind of research that will pay off in future\nUh uses and commercial opportunities for or what we growing race you know I Will stay researchers just a couple of weeks ago announced they're applying for patents\nFor us soy based a replacement for a paraffin wax all those Amazon boxes all across the world that get shipped with a paraffin wax waterproof from\nYou know we could and hopefully in a couple of years be making those are here in Iowa using something made out of soybeans so we'll add value to what we've grown raise but then also jobs all across rural Iowa\nTim Gannon thank you so much my bag I'm throwing the ball over to you now what do you think the number one or a ... facing a agriculture is right now\nYeah today I you know I've been saying we a lot of issues mostly what books are more worried about is getting into the field most recently but that would be the top of mind issue\nI Would say as I as I traveled to state there's there's no doubt that the the near term top of mind issue for folks is is very much focused on on trade\nAnd and markets and make and the impact that that's a disruptions that we're seeing the trade war that we're seeing especially with China is having on our on our markets okay and that that hits to profitability that hits to sustainability and I think it's just that it'd be the number one issue\nOr that that I'm hearing as I as I travel to stay so Ben encouraged to see some momentum here I'm In recent weeks you know starting with the conclusion of NAFTA negotiating after two point or us MCA\nUh the the uh indication that we're moving towards\nA negotiations with Japan than to you and and the u._k. this is all this is all good news we need to carry this momentum into resolving our situation with China\nAnd uh so yeah I I think that's the that's the number one issue that I'm hearing about when I'm when I'm traveling to state\nOr Mike my neck and Tim ... yesterday during the big show where they take a a break right now Doug group is going to bring us up to what's going on in the marketplace we're also going to be looking at whether and\nUh we're celebrating a Andy today another a nice day out in the fields at least it's not raining anywhere in the state of Iowa so well we're going to talk a little bit about whether a as well now I mentioned during the next half hour we're going to talk a little bit about water quality", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "23"}
