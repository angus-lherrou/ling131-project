M. T. [noise]\nRemaining moments here with mark still for a hunter history center that ordered by the way is the website ... and are a number of events now that you've got the home base and now that we're

round the holidays are at the history center\nYou'll get to be in another law will cause a lot of people do gyms along really rely on your family socio to Long Branch he'll be signing his book\nThe morning and welcome to ask the expert on six hundred WMD Jim going along with feeling need guard who is the community relations manager for senior housing management\nOh are ya I'm fantastic Neal you are you Jim good to see and yeah you do a blue and I said yeah unfortunately yes we'll end with the man happy to be here with the ...\nLed to have you here we're going to talk about a lot of things that are going on you might want to just mentioned to start off with that though you're working was what twenty four twenty six one six\nTwenty six yeah so senior housing management managers twenty six retirement communities or retirement living communities across Iowa in Illinois so that ranges from independent living the town homes and apartments to assisted living\nCloser care which is that step between assisted living and memory care and then finally that memory care which is secure programs for people with Alzheimer's and dementia\nSo there's no moving any more you can you can do the whole thing uh you know whatever you need all the way\nRight or any of our communities we've really mastered that aging in place so you move in once and we care for your loved one or yourself through end of life so it really just depends on what you're looking for and what area and we can certainly find a community that would meet your needs\nWhen it comes to memory care how does that work when you have a husband and wife there and maybe one or the other is beginning to have some needs for memory care but the other one isn't do you still let them stay together or how do you work\nThat that's a great question and it's something that's coming up more and more people in choir offer their loved one unfortunately Alzheimer's and dementia is affecting people at a younger and younger age that early onset and so people are wondering can I or do I want to stay with my loved one as they transitioned into a memory care\nAnd leave definitely put a lot of thought into this we've started designing our buildings and our apartments\nWith that in mind so having larger apartments so if the loved one or a spouse wants to come along they certainly can\nOr creating packages so that couples can reside under the same rough so in the same community but maybe in separate apartments so that way um the spouse that does not have the diagnosis can come and go as they please and be involved in other activities and other packages of items or um they can live under the same the same apartment\nOn me make that determination uh when someone is is beginning to have a little problem with their memory or do you have a doctor make that determination or do you have ... the other one's saying this is your time or how do you work\nFor a right and it really just depends on the support system at home so we obviously have an assessment that we do not only for people looking to move into memory care but for any level of care with us\nAnd it really just sort of takes a baseline so where we're at today whether that trauma ... memory standpoint from a health care standpoint from a I'm sort of just wishes and needs standpoint\nI so we would do that assessment and that advice what level of care they would be best and\nUm otherwise if you're a spouse or a loved one or a caregiver outside of the community are really looking for those um red flags a that would cause concern if you're not going to be with that person to provide that one on one care so um maybe some additional red flags to look for would be\nA inappropriate clothing so are they putting on a sweater when it's a hundred degrees outside or are we putting clothes on backwards or pajamas on 'em to go to church that type of thing um are we putting the car keys in the refrigerator or the milk in the broom closet those type of things that just don't quite make sense\nIt's not sort of that natural forgetful missed that we all have once in a while where we forget why we walked into a room and that type of thing\nUm and eventually you know you hear stories of people who do wander out the front door and think that they're on their way somewhere\nUm and then their their caregiver can't find them or maybe they're on their way home um from from a visit and forget which way to get home those type of things would be a major red flags not just for the day to day for forgetful mess so\nWe're really wanting to intervene before that time because obviously any of those situations and situations can set you up for a bad outcome and that's something that we really want to talk about today with the wild weather getting cold as well\nSure you've been a social if somebody comes to a couple of comes to you or how you determine right away we're if you have an opening where to put them in what have you you don't determine right away that necessarily live a memory problems you\nKnow and that's not something that we would um necessarily\nAccomplish on that first visit a that first visit visit is really just to share more about the community and what options they have and where they think they would be passed\nOn that assessment sort of comes after um you've chosen an apartment or made a deposit and\nKind of really expressed interest in the community we do that assessment really\nI'm at that point give people options so is it a closer care setting where we put these interventions in place and know that once we reach a certain point that would lead to memory care\nOr is that memory care right away do we want the spouse to live with their memory care resident is that something that they want to do or is it two separate apartments or maybe the spouse is going to stay at home and and choose to have the person\nDiagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia live with us\nNo most of the facilities to senior housing manage and people have are they are quick to take care of memory care\nThat's a great question because what we've seen is that people are able to live longer than ever before with medical advancements but we're not able to keep the brain working the way that it once did so I'm every single one of our communities offers a memory care in some way shape or form so that's really a testament to the needs because\nWe saw our own residence overtime advance to the point that they needed that so if they didn't at one time off or memory care they absolutely do now and every new community that we are taking on has a memory care program so you're seeing more and more of it is what you're saying and one more and diagnosed earlier and earlier\nOwn country and not necessarily in an older age some at a younger age\nAnd absolutely you know it used to sort of cars shock when we'd get someone who inquired and had a loved one who is in their seventies and diagnose and now it's not uncommon for us to see in their sixties or even fifties unfortunately\nOne gonna there's all kinds of now we're going to take a break before we do want to know which kind of tease him a little bit of up to your winter or opportunities for the folks it's coming up here\nYeah ... so if you're particularly worried for a loved one who may have Alzheimer's or dementia or maybe they maybe would be a good fit for assisted living just through these colder winter months get through the shoveling\nA and the traveling in the winter we do offer a short term winter's day so we'll talk more about that when we come back after the break absolutely know how to get a hold of ... you can visit our website WWW dot senior housing companies dot com or one eight hundred three six six sixty seven six teams
