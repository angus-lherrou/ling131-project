new dot com slash okay to download the yeah if I knew or knew\nDisease and you know gum disease I mean you name it everything else you you're aware of\nBut hearing you're not aware of until it happens to you until it happens at whatever age and it's not a magic age of old you know sixty five and I'm going to go sign up for Social Security and oh by the way I should get hearing aids is was just not how it works hearing loss happens when it happens happens from birth to death that's just\nIt is the facts of life number one cause of hearing loss as noise exposure so if you've been around noise anything over eighty decibels\nFor a minimum of Fifteen minutes you could have hearing loss so it's but it's nothing that's ever been talked about so we treated as an island over here until it's time it happens\nBut when you when you think over time there were always two groups that that had hearing aids you read or handicap or\nYou were what we call you know what most people would say is old um was funny as we had a woman that was a Ninety four Ninety five and she said well I'm not old enough yet to get hearing aids [laughter] I'm not going to be like those other old people [laughter] and you know so in her mind now she was young so old is relative and in in the mindset but\nThe two groups were you know handicap or elderly and\nNo one wanted to be in those two groups\nYou know old ... you were you know you wish weren't able to do anything handicapped met you know at the time there was something wrong\nSo no one ever wanted to be in those groups of the problem is with John's Hopkins and Dr Franklin and all the research that he's done over the course of the last Thirty years but more importantly what he's been finding from all of his studies over that time in the last you know five to seven years what we're really finding\nThat those that don't treat their hearing loss actually\nIt's a cognitive issue it's our ears conduct the sound our brain actually process is the information if we're depriving the brain of important information it actually is going dormant\nWe're losing cognitive um ability we're losing memory loss or work we're developing memory loss we're actually increasing brain shrinkage so we're actually causing the brain to shrink\nAnd lose tissue by not treating our hearing loss and it's amazing that you know I've been on the radio now for she's among the ... been doing this eight years at least and I've been talking about dimension you know all these things for eight years\nAnd I'll have people come in and now you know say I listen to you on the radio on and we'll test their herring and we'll sit down and talk about hearing and what they need to do to treat it there's only one if you have a sensory neuron hearing loss there's only one treatment\nIt's hearing it's mhm there isn't surgery there isn't a what's going to get better oh you can you know go do some you know reading or ... and and it's kind of help you won treatments hearing it but how many people look at me and say well thanks for the information I'm going to go and think about it\nAnd I'm just sitting there thinking\nI I just gave you all the information on what can happen\nOr what is going on and I had a gentleman um yesterday and and I explained\nHow the test was going to work that I'm going to you know I'm going to test his hearing when he hears towns are going to push the button and\nThat part of the tests just kind of gives me a reference point but then I'm going to move on and and give him words and have him repeat them and that's the critical part to hearing loss is your brain if we put hearing aids on you is your brain going to understand what is said because it's still can or have you lost comprehension or cognition\nAnd you know you've lost part of that and it's never going to return and people look at me and they said was that me\nAnd I'll explain that you know your brain actually loses the ability to understand words so few score eighty percent on that part of the test that means you'll never score above eighty percent you're ... you're you're cognition is it eighty percent you've lost twenty percent\nThe best you can do as a hundred percent and that's where we want you to be that means then you have a hearing loss will put hearing aids on but the clarity will still be there\nAnd the gentleman you know when I got down to explain to them that you know you've got eighty percent\nUnderstanding and you know he took it real serious and he looked at me and he said well I don't want that to go on I don't want that to get any lower set up I've already lost some of this I don't want it to get any lower and that's the important thing people need to understand is the signal has to get to the brain\nIf the brain isn't getting signals what are you expected to do I mean it's it's automatically going to lose it because it's not getting the correct signals or it's getting the incorrect signals um you know think about it like um you know your cable if the cable if it's not getting the correct signal\nYou're not getting you know the TV's gonna look squarely in the mid ... think of it like when if you have direct TV and or have satellite and it's like the wind gets really heavy or um it rains really hard and the TV starts going in and out\nYour brain's doing the exact same thing that is your brain that your brain without hearing aids is getting a messed up signal and I actually saw a woman last um those Monday I'm Sorry on Monday and\nAsked her you know what's going on and she said you know I've had a hearing last for a while\nAnd she said I'm starting to get 'em it's starting to kind of making me anxious and she said more importantly I'm working so hard to hear people she works in the school cafeteria\nAnd she said I'm working so hard to hear the kids that I'm actually straining to hear the kids but I actually memorize their orders\nSo when I see them I Know what their orders are because I Can't understand what they're saying and I don't want to mess it up\nAnd I said are you tired when you get home she said yeah I said no are you mentally tired when you get home and she said yeah I Am because she's working so hard she's putting her brain into overdrive\nTrying to compensate for something that she can't compensate for you can't compensate for hearing loss I mean you can sure try\nBut you can't compensate for so she's not only trying you know struggling to hear but she's actually having to use your brain overtime because she's trying to memorize so many things that is an overload there's going to cause you know long term issues and you know you know thank goodness she's going to treat it but it's amazing\nWhat we really know and what we know about the brain\nThat in your ears and the brain are connected as one and it's important that you treat it hearing loss is the second largest epidemic in the United states by and heart disease second largest\nDo you ever heard about that you ever hear that no you don't hear about heart disease all the time yeah um but you never hear about about hearing loss so second largest epidemic\nIt is the number one handicap\nOf any person over the age of sixty five so hearing loss is the ... is the number one handicap over\nThe age of sixty five so think about those two things right there and if you're out there sitting you know I turn the TV and my wife says I you know that I don't hear and you know and yeah you're right I Do struggle and I get angry angry but I get anxious and you know I get um\nIf I Know we're going to go somewhere I get it you know it just starts to kind of work me up 'cause I Know I'm not going to hear very well\nIf you're sitting at a hearing that and in saying those things it's time you get into concept and get your hearing checked and find out what you need to do\nAnd if it's if it's a money thing we have hearing aids across the board that start at seven hundred and fifty dollars and go up from there now it may not be exactly what you need for your hearing loss because you're hearing last may dictate\nA hearing aid that may cost a little bit more but at worst case scenario gets started don't wait don't ... you know we have people will say I'm gonna I'm gonna save up and I'm going to wait till I get the very best\nWhile you're doing is prolong your prolonging your issue gets started we have a training program\nWhere you can trade the hearing aids in you know and ... will help and we have you know zero percent interest financing plans I mean we have we have a leasing option we have all kinds of options so if it's a money issue we've got a solution you just have to pick up", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cedar Rapids", "day": "11"}
