threads his whatsoever do\nYou have high ceilings yo yo yo luckily in states at all the ... the news guy yeah a lot of news going on to a lot of new going on Yeah Yup some of the news here is a is not good\nSome real good and I think the reason why we've been doing a show about sixteen years now in the financial never is lacking\nFor giving us stuff to talk about is it never never never know but I thought it today we spend a little time going through some good things and bad things and also some checklist and an eight thinks everyone needs to know when when we talk about Wall Street because\nEverybody is in Wall Street whether they think they're in Wall Street or not everybody has some ties to Wall Street a lot of people say I don't care about Wall Street I'm not in it well maybe the company you work for years and if they have a bad series of reports you might want to think about looking for another job somewhere else before you get those pink slips that might come around the house and every single week we we meet with folks who want fortunately\nGet those pink slips and then we'd meet with him and we try to make sure to\nTo bring them back from the roof you know 'cause that that's really bad when something bad happens and emotionally you're in a different place when did this the ... the stages of rage in stages of depression and then you basically combined when you are told the company doesn't need you anymore oh yeah but he just closed its doors when you get there so\nOne of the things we do with people we serve is that we help them map out number one where they are right now and amazingly\nIt's not as bad as you think of as many times and we and matter of fact we seen some folks who were told by a company that they weren't need anymore and when we sat down to analyze were they were right now financially where they wanted to go into in retirement and their dreams and and even the dreams not just an easy but then once\nThey could have retired a couple of years ago if they have the right way of putting the right plan together translating that financial plan that everyone has and you might not think you have one but if you have any money saved anywhere you have a financial plan for you and you know when you always planned to save more in the future but it never happens Mr Moore but it's translating that\nLump sum and everyone has a lump sum somewhere maybe more than one translating that lump sum it up into a retirement income I call it [noise]\nPhilip money that's going to come to your mailbox each and every year regardless of what happens in the market regardless of what happens anywhere you're going to get that check and hopefully that check will increase we built increasing income into our retirement plans and so it's basically taken the ... out of living in retirement when you know that checks are gonna come Monday bills are going to come to I think\nExactly right and we I had a nice listen to come in and the other\nHey there was a that is a ... my twenty six years of my so what's the most enjoyable part of your job that is telling someone that the numbers tell us that they can retire sooner versus him later dead even a lot of times that we can retire today yeah\nYou know and I'm Wondering I'm finding too as if uh you're you're working with younger clients what I'm Talking about say the late thirties into the forties and they may not think about these kinds of things and it's it's good that you make sure that they are aware no matter as you said coach whatever their financial situation is right now right they can augment that by doing the right things with your advice\nYeah yeah absolutely right and so and then that knowing that you can retire when you want maybe you don't want to retire I'm not I'm not planning on every time but I Know\nIs that his name to hack yeah like yeah it's one of the timberland but [laughter]\nYou know as he as good as he seems like it's really good he's really nice guy I met him yet the nightclub were on the radio obviously so we've had a special meeting with them in the last year I got to meet a band called ... have you ever to order absolutely really cool it really cool guys to do\nA lot of these people you see on TV uh they're they're stuck up and they're not fun to be around do you watch homeland it all on Showtime course I went up I read some reports the other day about ... it was his name Saul yeah he's one of the most unfriendly guys to work with in Hollywood they really mean he walks in says lines and what's right back to the trailer [laughter]\nOh man he looks like when you think about it yeah he does all the ways that part of\nA very very bill ... but evidently\nHe really is I mean I don't want I wouldn't know about that I Would hope you do everything I Want to take so I get the heck yeah yeah and he finally takes all day doesn't kill that in character maybe later in character the hold up well a sort of is that John McEnroe wish and speaking of that Steve rolled it takes [noise]\n\nWell Marty I Want you to talk about this for me to because we got this report came on the wire services and in the wall Street Journal by the way\nMerrill Lynch to resume charging commissions on retirement accounts and then they said that it was the move as a result of the court ruling throwing out labor department's produce it ruined client's best interest interest so let's talk about this you you are you called my tension in this report so I Want you to tell me a little bit about your feelings on this ...\nAbsolutely as many of you know that there was a fiduciary rule that was going to be put in place and it was basically going to say that any retirement account\nThere could not be any commission's charge to get that account it would have to be the only so Merrill Lynch the largest investment firm and the country decide they would get out in front of his real Chuck and say okay if you're not in a fee based account and it is an IRA account we have to move you\nTo a fee based account or you're going to have to take the count and moving away from era which\nSo some of the people were already in a commission based in other words they paid commissions to get into the account those are called ... an interest rate sort of like when you go to the state fair unless you're lucky enough to have a coupon to get in free you pay for it to the right and so they paid the entrance fee and the deal the entrance fee was\nWhen you get into a show like that there are fees are going to be a lot less in the future because we're there might not be anything because you paid a fee to get in so they already paid the fee to get in and then down the road to come up with this thing we're going to move you out of the the account you already paid the fee to get in into an account we're going to charge you see every quarter absolutely\nAnd they and they said that the food that rule was requiring you don't do that which is false and this is the key the rule never pass\nKind of rules and they came out with this after they knew that the deal already didn't pass now how can they get away with something like that just shut day are a big company they work with the banks ... billion with a\nBank to bank of America O'Hara legit here's here's what's so crazy Chuck imagine this you're sixty five Seventy years old you're lucky enough to be in an account with marijuana it's a retirement account and let's say you have some principle production\nMerrill Lynch says we have to move you to a fee based account which is a risk account and invested in the stock market the market goes to a correction which we aren't dissipating a correctional the market\nImagine is let's say your brother is that an account this principle protected they say you have to move it into a risk based account because we have to charge you a fee and the market correct about twenty five or thirty percent how do you feel about that ...\nNow you've lost a lot of your double whammy yeah it's it's it's going to get away with something like that as we mentioned we weren't going to get by and what can you have a big meeting with other apps and they get them all excited then they play this music oh\n\nWell that's a straight guy for that consumer and the client will tell you it's not good\nWell here's here's the thing about that it's not been an issue because the market it's just been going up and up and up and up and up\nThat people are going to wipe out if they see those losses that you're talking about when they moved out over I mean so what's the alternative what can\nThey do well this is the this is what this report that came in and they made all these changes but everybody in the the the basic counts that goes you know what would change their mind that we're going to go back where we can starts commissions get oh yup\nYup well I mean so doesn't make any sense for the consumer doesn't\nKnow it will be no city out of the consumer and if I were Marilyn quiet I Would have some serious concerns about this change of direction\nSo we have a financial checklist we go through one of the things on there is does this make sense to you to do this you're the person listening you the person who has her money there and that would fail on our test one that I Do share a review fail tests west and and that would not check and so once we have one no\nWe we throw it out because they should be all yeses on his checklist if we have one do I don't like these things well it's not going her deathbed or it's okay or that's what everyone else is doing no that's wrong you know and that's we see that way too much\nIn this report their coaches passionate about that I read this report and there were Thirteen different times in this article where they use the word broker\nFor any of our listeners when you hear the word broker that is I commissioned type if he is not an advisor he is he or she or he usually we see a lot of them as your email brokers out there he or she a radio a broker if you call yourself a broker that is very difficult to call yourself a new Sherry\nI used to joke that they call themselves to broker because they make you folks you know need my opinion do need for broker anymore when you have a license for new series out there who were ... the best advisors\nExactly right and they called themselves advisors advisory that's ...\nYeah I Want a true fiduciary which is an investment advisor license with the state or the federal government is different licensing has different test is called a series sixty five license so point blank ask your person who you're dealing with our you sixty five license and they'll say oh yeah here we are in a sale you also broker license summer but some are due license\nRight I mean they can charge fees and commission and then the double whammy as I'll basically we're talking about either on your side or they're not on your idea of a different agenda point blank say they're either on your side whether or not the right ... that's exactly right they work it for you or are they working for the bank that's right but\nThat is exactly right I Want somebody in my retirement I Want so yeah he was working about me and not\nAll the time so I'm not for me Ninety eight percent of the time of the bank to present a time because that's you know I got to be a hundred percent right on your side and they must be you know nobody I mean this alert lighting for you I mean well yeah Marty sent this that we all basically where ...\n... I saw this article when I was just a do use a term that my dad used to say I was flabbergasted\nWell we're baffled did it get away with these days this survey but they hide behind the big bang umbrellas a lotta times right in the lobby like millions of dollars to lobbyist and to get away with it and we always see when when they get caught on this you hardly ever see someone go to jail or or get fined\nIt's always the bank pay into finding those they they always say well we pay a fine but we don't admit any guilt well if you pay the fine [laughter] I think you're if you're paying a fine what do you think right what do you think Bob ...\nAnd I'm going to\nVery careful because this is your money we're talking about this is your retirement you may have to work longer maybe retirement because you have someone taking fees that I always used to say and I've said this for sixteen years on the radio and twenty six years to clients whose retirement fund to yours or you brokers\nYours yeah All right so\nIf you're one of the ten people call but at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement this offers for you will put together for your very own retirement plan will look at where you are right now in the financial world were very passionate about making sure you're on the right track will isolate any financial termites you have folks that is unnecessary in my opinion\nThese risk and conditions we call those financial termites\nThey're hitting a lot of times if you had termites in your house would you want to know about them today\nOr ten years from now or certainly before you're out as a really long term I guy comes and puts a little trap around the yard and then the ... will put some financial trips out there who are like mouse trap so once we find those fees are not get away we are going to get rid of before you were going to eliminate them\nBut you're not going to get rid of them if you don't admit they might exist and if you're saying I don't have any fees you're absolutely wrong is always be somewhere right so we'll find out what's going on well look at the financial pass you on right now\nWill diagram a way that you get to for you to get back on that path or if you're on the right path in the great to know everything's fine Gore and really no it's fine deep down inside your mind is always that will seat of doubt that you're not quite sure if if you're going back every year to the guy who gave you the first opinion for a second opinion you're really not getting a second opinion getting reinforced\nFirst opinion so let's get that through second opinion we call it a financial MRI\nLot deeper than X ray looking at everything that you find this world in diagram me out for you your true retirement plan your true peace of mind when we go through Social Security reviews we we've had people that are what kind of claim of Social Security strategy that we're going to cost him about a hundred thousand dollars worth of their life if they didn't take the right one so we are limited to that confusion\nWe look at the fees will get the risk we make sure that you're on the right path we have some money dedicated\nTo retirement income we call it [noise]\nFinancial to plant every single year retirement you get a check the check could grow we also have a spending leave playing you you have a like let's say someone has a million dollars and they're worried about spending it because they want to leave it to their spouse or the next ... next of kin\nAnd spend a week when we'll give you income for the rest of your retirement and when you pass away\nEqual to or greater than what you started with goes on your next of kin spend it and leave it and then we also incorporate the advance to protect strategy you get gains you advance it you walk to gain in if the market goes down the next year you don't lose\nYou always advancing and protecting makes a whole lot of sense we see that the football team gets to lead\nThey're not passing them all over the place they're going forward for yards at a time of dancing and protecting and the three main points that are missing in many financial plans growth\nProtection in income you can have all of these do you call right now for the next ... worked great for you guys out there with a million but as long as you have two hundred dollars that we can get to work for you to get you on a path to financial righteousness\nOur goal here at the shows to help you make the best decision possible\nSo if you have any questions about what we're talking about or how when they apply to your own situation you can sit down and get a retirement roadmap put together\nAnd Paul Roberts whose coach Pete's local trusted financial coach and the Biloxi area and his team will translate for you that complex financial world and it's a very clear instructions now if you want to take advantage of getting this true\nOne of the three guys behind the basics\nAnd everyone's heard of Richard Branson and he must course but Peter demonic says the brains I think behind the operation and and so that one too and makes a couple years ago called the vision ear\nAnd you'll look around that society these days there's always somebody trying to do something to make things better\nAnd then there's always someone trying to do things worse too about the bank they're charging fees on people so\nDisruption that call Amazon dot com is has just written well first of all disrupted the book selling industry now is disrupting everything you know after ... ... you get you get an Amazon at a bank and everything I wouldn't banquet Amazon by the way I buy books from actually weeks' supply why we buy paper towels and beverages and everything from 'cause it's a lot cheaper\nCan be wise to just press a button and it is to have to go out and go shock and if you lived in New York City or if you lived in a skyscraper think about when when you want to go shopping back to the day you'd have to that's all day event\nSometimes as the the L day was broken Seattle walked down thirty five years I have a taxi cab which were owned it's its own fun and games there and you're ready to go to a store buy the food lug it back into the cab we'll get back up the steps\nAll day if they are right or you press one button on Amazon deliberate did or the FedEx and UPS men are too happy about that [laughter] I'd had opposed Mandalit a flight of stairs I'll tell\nYou what I got seven grandkids that's how we give them since we use that as I I don't touch it it gets sent right to their house all wrapped up in looks pretty\nTalking about what makes me excited the Amazon gift card 'cause I mean you can get anything you want their editors trying to get something you don't want like when I was younger we will get underway for Christmas [laughter] ever the friend alarms oh gosh I myself\nI don't know I saw an article today Jeff Bezos view that sermon of the company they said he makes one point five million dollars a day on his money on interest the nonprofit more interest on his money that's pretty nice pretty nice yeah that's like the whole kind of money [laughter]\nSo we look at the are going to quickly touch on this and then when we were on the next thing we're going to go through what we call brokers behaving badly unfortunately this is a story or more every day we finally have to go down to one a week but I'm looking at something called the auto retirement here that we're designing and it's about when you look at an artist and artist starts with a blank piece of campus and\nThen it's up to him or her to make a masterpiece\nAnd if you gave me a blank piece of campus and I and a paint brush I'd make a mess ... well that's got it on the war and all that so that's happening a lot of times when the financial world how do you know the plane or you're dealing with is Israel is an artist a financial artist how do you know\nIf they're working for a big institution you trust that big institution has looked at it but how do you really know if they're putting a plan together\nBased on what you have and so let's say that you you give the artist you give the Blake canvassing you give them some uh some yellow paint\nSome blue paint and some red paint and they paint just red yellow and blue on the painting\nYou gave it to a real artist and a real planner they'd make yelling boo now they have green writes it in ... and if you mix the while he let me give you test jak if you mix red and blue what do you get purple [laughter] so it's about the visionary not just saying what you have the right let's let's take those colors and let's combine them\nLet's hybrid dies I mean let's make a painting that everyone can be proud of and now you've got a ... kind of thing where you get the guy just those pain all over the stuff\nThe cameras and things oh we're going to try to sell it for a hundred and ... let me tell you what it is when he was going to love that you know the painting ... is is a five thousand years old and you you've got these guys looking at it let me tell you what he was like what he was like in any way that her ... as for me to talk of what he's trying to get done real quick taco truck without going to talk of the heritage was outside of\nThe food Carrie it's not going to try you know he's gone up so it's about putting the proper plan together and I
