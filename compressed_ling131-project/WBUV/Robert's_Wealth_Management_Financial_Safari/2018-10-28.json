I was\nTalking about the person sounded okay that is that makes sense no and that's an immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing and that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met data us it does I mean that's almost ... percent right I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon of ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax cuts that on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter] remember these to cut through the cans with it yeah and then it got through a tomato I remember the guy to take the ginsu knives out then they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream\nAnd to cut it off a heart attack and then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three forced into your bag and drift over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd edit out of your money that you're trying to best why that's a really good in the United states slice outlay slice of the money you put in when somebody goes in your pocket some of them do and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really hurt us you've heard the phrase non traded ... have you heard that I have\nYeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but\nAll right to non trade that means if you buy it\nYou can't sell it right or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's been silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from shore her last yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter] I\nMight as my commission they say so they make commissions both ways okay yeah so it'll be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why\nAnd say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times of the fact that people know the where they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow that's what I was going\nTo add and we we hear a lot of people who say advantage of the rental situations uh read is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to and it's like oh gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm So forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then be because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there we go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have\nAll they've heard about the strikes a which is hopefully this will go up in value can sell for profit but what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I said hopefully hopefully yeah yeah I'm\nGoing to get a bell but ... and\nYou said maybe thinking though economy hopefully your fun to play with ... All right so\nBut it's not joking better people are getting into these they should get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a cup in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money ... ... and there's no guarantee that money will ever go up and we've seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment or I'm going to ask me about say about that okay", "show_name": "Robert's Wealth Management Financial Safari", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "28"}
