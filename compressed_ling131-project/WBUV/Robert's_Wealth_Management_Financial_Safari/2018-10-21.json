and that's the dilemma that's a problem a lot of people have so what we usually recommend is something we call bucket balance right so buckets of money so we need to take your money out of that one big bucket and balance it amongst three buckets and each bucket with its own purpose\nAnd you know balancing your buckets is very important and so simple and yeah but it's but you know 'cause we're looking at one big bucket and and if you ever have a big bucket of back in the day we've had these gigantic ten gallon buckets we'd have to fill fill water and bring it in one place to go there we put ... one summer and then\nForgot about him and just whatever health reasons but never tried to carry a big bucket of water that spilled over the top what happens to well let's see well I suppose it's all over and it doesn't help you know doesn't know and so every now and then uh maybe you'll lose balance in and they'll all be gone\nAnd so we have our money in the market bucket and the market goes the wrong way ... we may just run into\nRubble and maybe we'll get overloaded as the market keeps going up like a does what are you going to do the money's going to continue to go up if the market goes up but at the market goes down this what people forget about what happens to your money them\nAnd how do we know with certainty that we're going to have a count that has gross protection from the

balance better be going pretty good after twenty five years at a company or I Hope so yeah so when you when you put money into four one Kay what do you put money away for\nYour retirement that right at steady retirement income later on in life\nSo but the main problem I've seen is the options many times you don't have enough options or maybe you haven't had good guidance because you have a four one K. a person who administers the four one K. you may luckily if you're walking see that person once a year if you're lucky and you really have to say do what makes you feel good they really don't spend enough time with you and then you don't really\nYou know how the performance is or the hidden fees and therefore would catch whereas personal experience tells me that absolutely so again the four one K. accounts or for your retirement when it'd be great to retire your current four one K. was not performing well all announce to the past year so to speak there you go you know and so a lot of people ask Ken I retire my four one K.\nAccount wasn't working really oh yeah so that is interesting that I'm ... yeah and it will financial planning gets frequent everybody shore so is that possible well saving money to four one K.\n... does has some benefits are actually get the match into ... but some people find it unfavorable because the lack of flexibility yup inside the plant absolute and no income availability and they're so what you're doing is you're saying to put a lot of money and my four one K.\nWill Steve I think if you go both ways a lot of people get over confident and a strong economy and they spend more money than they should we like to categorize money in red\nGreen and yellow accounts the yellow counsel for emergencies that's the money you need to build up its outside the four one K. and outside of retirement plans that you can get if you need it for emergencies if you haven't built your emergency account up now is a good time too and if you

got when it looks like a big golden feather okay yeah I can see it at our studio and then our offices we have two of them and I actually have a ring the best selling all three wow which are are they maybe pay four dollars but I thought I was qualified to get it in the spring and looks like a Super Bowl rings okay it does yeah yeah and I got one of the one of the ... at least for success or not mix with the four okay\nOr the other one raise those Evan baby steps one I Love ... wonderful love the stores throughout it but the success anonymous books with Steve Forbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay\nAnd Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I get and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms and\nWaste a recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food wise ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup chicken something else to catch it or you know it was like he would never waste a chicken as they would take the chicken bone or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey stewards ... you go yeah so it is it making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you are in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and\nIf that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the you're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement is make sure that the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not overpaying on these that's right and\nAnd a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought I was just garbage ... anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many feet right not statement where the fees are really show many times when it's looking at the actual products of strategies you're in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really\nThe recession proving retirement well it shouldn't be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your needs ahead of their needs us right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes in what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising retirement so about ... you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need to make sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom design the plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment oh in real detail but nine ways to protect you\n... okay your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement so about a bird it sits in the nest and it's like sits on the egg and it gets it all nice and warm and they finally had just mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so facts are because we want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides million you\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic many of our listeners\nNow it's a big enough for when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and it goes out to shore to think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to where to retire [laughter] I Would imagine they would begin going yeah\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five not\nAbout this on the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is it doesn't seem like a do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made this conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas by spoken word\nOften causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways ... ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now we're ...\nWe do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plans\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and in certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous we're not as what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I have four is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right us right that's right when the chance to become a guarantee you when it's a hundred percent\nExactly when something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement a success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people's strategy for\nWhere we end again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of sort of we call retiring with success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they tried to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race verbal racer examine other word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but ... you don't really want me to have a great retirement that yeah so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money in retirement so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money every time it but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do this right period mhm no disclaimer no but no uh most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy and radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well\nA lot of visors say the four percent rule doesn't work it rained down market right and so he proceeded to say well it worked signed it up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things [laughter]", "show_name": "Robert's Wealth Management Financial Safari", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point",
