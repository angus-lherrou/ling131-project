of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty unquote serve was self sacrifice and without regard to their own life virtually every American respects the medal of honor and a significant self sacrifice that the award conveys is this concept of self sacrifice well revered\nIs missing so noticeably from our society today I'm certain that are selfish preoccupation was instantaneous

devotion to duty his personal bravery serves as an example of what leadership is all about and reflects great credit upon himself his unit the United States Marine corps and the naval services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEver exhibited by United States senators in the history of our nation while associate justice\nKavanaugh did Nazis bullets emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in the most offensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America\nThose very senators knew all too well to to judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians and public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conducted less actual ... says proven innocent almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court had

said innuendo for political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin okay Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nThe different type of battle equally as important to when justice Kevin fought to protect the very fabric of the constitution he has sworn to defend by not\nBacking down he convinced me of his moral courage in the face of unwavering criticism was the primary underpinning genetic civilized societies the presumption of innocence this nonsense that the presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side upon the very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law the sheer to publicity of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politicians second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stripped from\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators was tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when the nation centered citizens into combat and into the military\nAs a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution to military supported in harm's way whereas elected leaders are obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress both arenas are critical if our nation
