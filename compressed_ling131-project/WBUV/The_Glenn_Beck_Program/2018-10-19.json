{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Of four nine ... nine\n[laughter] you're listening\nTo the Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on news talk one more night W. B. B. in Biloxi and news radio seven ten W at GM and Ninety nine five back then the jag immobile news headlines\nComing up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... Michael good morning\n... good morning Kelly Happy Friday to you both\nBack out on this this story of the ... we've been referring to this is the missing Saudi journalist and I've noticed that day to day\nA lot of the news organizations have switched over in her ... starting to say now assumed murdered Saudi journalist so we we big knowledge that this has happened yet\nWe knowledge that at least according to Turkish officials and again\nWe're relying heavily on the Turkish officials here to conduct the investigation 'cause it's happening in their land in any evidence that's happening in regards to what might be a murder or\nTheir responsibility there digging up the evidence they're\nPulling things together they're creating a timeline for all of this to happen so when they say that they have evidence that can show he was murdered were kind of believing that element of it now as far as the\nFacts that we know we know that he showed up to the conflict to show he did and that others video proof of that happening to the editor constantly and then he never left the consulate aside from that\nThose are the facts that we know at this point we're waiting for the investigation from the Turkish officials and frankly from the Saudi officials as well\nAs to what happened in between that and what happened to show he hasn't been seen since then we know that yesterday Turkish officials are took to investigating a forest area a\nBright sort of close by with a constantly there's where they feel or some of the fans from the Saudi conflict made their way through this war so they've got a cadaver dogs out sniffing around trying to see if they can find anything maybe it's possible that they\nA toss some body parts of the show ... they're they're not exactly sure but they are conducting this investigation and they're saying to everybody in the world wide\nThey're expecting to have this investigation wrapped up here in a matter of days which is also what Mike Pompeo has asked President Trump or just a few days so that these groups would have the ability to conduct their investigations improper fashion\nSo where where does this leave us diplomatically\n[noise] oh that's a good question uncle Henry I think that that's a question uh that that we get to see I think right now everything is on pause almost everything is on ... so we saw yesterday that Mike Pompeo\nCame back from his trip to not only Saudi Arabia but also the turkey told President Trump that they needed a few more days to investigate or the Saudis and the Turks did to investigate what happened to ... so that the president is kind of said okay that's fine we can definitely do that and I think that by some time\nFor the U.S to figure out where they stand in regards to Saudi Arabia and what worst case scenario will look like in regards to if they have to apply sanctions on some level or have you know some sort of of of repercussions are consequences for the Saudis I'm One of the big questions here was a report that Mike Pompeo had heard\nThis audio tape but the Turks say that they have the actual data to show and that he was given a copy of the transcript well that was rescinded today by Turkey's foreign minister saying that his country is not shared any audio recordings from the disappearance with U.S officials are which backs up what\nMike Pompeo was saying about all this but there are still questions here in DC in regards to mobile hold on a second didn't pump go out there to collect facts was this a fact finding mission so he went out to Saudi Arabia but then his own words\nDid not talk about facts with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia then he went over to turkey and apparently didn't ask for or demand to hear the tape or see the transcripts that the Turkish officials are saying uh proves the murder of ... by Saudi Arabia so\nWhat exactly was your fact finding mission and what did you bring back and talk to the president about those are questions that are short to be asked year over the next couple of days before we get to the end of the investigations from the Turkish officials\nSo Michael power if the Turks say we finished the investigation and and they did it the Saudis did it in and here's how we know they did it and then the Saudis say no\nWe didn't show didn't watch for us what do we do that\nSo then I think we ... it from there you got to look at the evidence that whatever it is the Turks say has led them to believe that it was the Saudis who did it if they release a copy of this tape that they say that they have I I Believe that that would be difficult for the Saudis to say that they didn't have anything to do with it um there's also reports today that the Saudis are kind of stepping up\nStorylines and New York times is reporting that the rulers of Saudi Arabia are considering blaming\nA top intelligence official close to the cramped and like almost\nUncomfortably close to the crown prince we're talking about a mentor a major general ... sorry who is a\nRanking advisor to the crown prince and they're saying that that would be an extraordinary recognition of somebody so close to the crown prince involved in this uh but again I guess that's what you have to do when you're talking about the magnitude of this international backlash so they're looking at that as a possibility um again\nWe'll have to see what the investigation shows that we already know that whatever it was a puppy or had to tell President Trump\nYesterday when he had his briefing there was a change of two from President Trump now see the secretary of treasury stimulation is not going to go to the big investment called right so it was going to be out by the crown prince and Saudi Arabia I think that's a huge step for the U.S as well as other\nCountries around the world who decided not to send somebody there it's a big move for the U.S who consider Saudi Arabia to be a huge ally to step away and say we're not going to be attending a conference I think makes a big political ... and and a statement that that they have to now closer look at what might be ramifications if indeed the Saudis are found that done this\nOr we're at a time

viewing GMC studios he's used talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nA caravan of thousands of Central American migrants keeps coming I'm Dave Anthony Fox News but President Trump dismisses it as a Democrat let us all before the midterm\nThree weeks before an election it's almost like Donald Trump was like hey guys would you mind to creating a caravan and sending it this way and I what I Will do is that we'll talk about it and it will help us win this election and then afterwards you guys can go back home will pay for your boss\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group\nWith you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to who knows what ... where's the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like a lot\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told this story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area it's a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said\nThat I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter]\n\nStop and think about how you know pretty protective\n... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walked in Honduras\nAnd there was a group of people that I don't know [laughter] ... outlook there are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are things on the level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to\nGet the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of every one is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old\nThat this is a different it's a different story a and\nYou just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know 'cause the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it or you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like their ... their top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security that they're there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico is does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location so they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they only work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back to them they send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even do can interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's a [noise] a\nBlatantly racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there we\nWould never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would have ... a supportive policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to flip the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border of people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting I it's a gift it is and and he's telling Republicans that said hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start\nTalking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard any of them doing that\nAre any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the\nParty I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate or I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has a I think a great chance of winning or people do it because her opponent there is like\nIf you took a Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female\nBody of a congresswoman you would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah hang it to the lab of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truth or shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history and the ... of the air force incredibly accomplished yeah has a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your makes gives a coat pink worker a code pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with code picker nine ... an entire um that still rising her views I don't know exactly she ... she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again like she like co hosted a show\nWith someone who is uh nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona and its supporters state the big deal there ... is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but yeah I get a look at the other side of that yet with that though\nDoesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out

John Francis or father to Ulysses Francis or work or who will go as UFO\nUm for much of his life [noise] um and\nAnd from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that going if you were born

Don ... jak you\nOr a Frank mhm here called ... and Franks\nTwice right yeah so does your guest who got because that is true or do we just learned that amazing actors now remember I didn't realize to keep that had not just El Paso and all of a sudden the ... all over Texas is apparently what's true here yeah um and and I one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIs it true that there is no example of someone named Robert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named\nUh what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert and people call you Gilbert apparently tobacco you do not exist you are not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence that you exist so if you happen to be a Robert an Albert a Gilbert or an embarrassingly\nSmall baritone and obviously you're probably going to have a Hispanic nickname right that's kind of a Hispanic man I Would probably\nI mean they're so yeah I Would I don't know what you would shorten don't go to except maybe that's how I guess I I don't I don't know any um people who are not Hispanic there who are named ...\nAnd and this is an opportunity for us a pet and do a two white white white ... we're talking

are some examples I can think of one off the top of my head whose name Robert Francis or work and he calls himself Beto but is there is this a common thing to the point of\nI Believe his standard was everyone who gets ... named one of those names in Texas or in in this community needs communities would be referred to as best [laughter] is it possible is there a unicorn out there that is named

E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him at home but if this is not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from you know his campaign served stuff was that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit yeah I'm Irish American it I mean I'm from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ad or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all\nTrying to be a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and apply you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F.

K. and just stop trying to BP if you're not that he's\nWorking on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean better ... better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson will [laughter]\nAnd it was a tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing a\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see

Obama during his presidential\nCats is that the presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick loggia wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win but I mean again ear between Iran and fifty and almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a ... um and the other thing that kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately\nUm we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and knowing how we just you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often worried about uh the Senate there's a little bit of there was a little bit of something there to be\nWorried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ...\nI I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll\nBe a double digit I think there's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida and ... mindset Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the opposite ends up on ... yeah well I saw it's called but um they pretty much a separate but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete toss no reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that brand they're all bumped all buck the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain\nAbout a summer cold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because Democrats are now communist again the socialist in communist yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again West Virginia is the state is probably the most pro trumped state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know ... you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia it got mentioned you've got his cabinet vote you have a couple of but again this is the guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nUh but uh it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mansion seat you're\nIn a year at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that they're the most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my seat\nThere I think honestly you had two races decided by the cabinet vote one was mansion ... high temp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nDon't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look at again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is when we got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing\nThe same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures and good for North Dakota and for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah\nYeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well I mean this this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate\nIs if if all that happened is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and that's the thing there's going to be almost nothing they can get through ... nothing with the exception of maybe some\nBipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it\nBut other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're gonna have tough times with any regulation\nYou're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy as long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah chest just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah uh yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what let's hope we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there's a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats can pick up eighty three seats\nNow to point one percent chance really unlikely like you say that to an absolute no what's that going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now it's that bad and\nThe early morning September eleventh blaze at the shipyard located near elder ferry road destroyed two large buildings and cause more than two million in damage\nThere were no injuries reward money up to ten thousand dollars is being offered by the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms and the Mississippi State fire Marshall's office\nThe Mississippi high school activities association will hold an appeal hearing on Tuesday after it suspended performances by the forest hill high school band for the balance of the school year\nThe Jackson public schools filed an appeal after the NHL say a imposes this tension because of the bands halftime show in Brookhaven which included a reenactment of the movie scene that had some of the students holding toy assault rifles on other band members portraying police officers\nTwitter's under fire after announcing they bumped suspended American activists Lewis Farrah Khan who tweeted I'm not an anti Semite I'm an anti termite meanwhile you've got Facebook ramping up its efforts to fight fake news and the run up to election day Fox is Claudia ... with the details\nFacebook showing off its new war room where teams of engineers and security experts are working around the clock to root out bad actors trying to mislead users about who they are and what they're doing Facebook's head of cyber security is Nathaniel glacier\nSo if I Am representing you that I'm independent\nActually I Am running fifty different pages together and they all look independent but they're not they're being coordinated that's an example of inauthentic behavior\nWhen bogus content is flag the company will either take it down or reduce its distribution and then let users you know what the true story is so they're better informed erupt today down Kelly Bennett\n[noise]\nThere's still a fair amount of work to be done I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that the secretary of state Pompeo said arriving in Mexico city for talks about the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.S border I just\nWant to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping at awfully before it ever gets to\nFurther drove it around my last night in Montana he again blamed Democrats voted on and on the slot just before the election his critics say insulting migrants with claims they're being paid to join the care of and the U.S still waiting for results of the investigation into the presumed murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey Fox to Simon known as the latest on the pro life from London\nDave Turkish state media reports the prosecutors have been questioning employees at the Saudi ... alleged ...
