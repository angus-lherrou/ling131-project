M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles these headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin welcome back\nOn Monday morning to cooler out there this morning ... much appreciate it yes yes yes yes [noise]\nAre you guys have been chatting this morning already I Know we have a state this morning about the ah Murphy high school students in mobiles who was bullied on line for homecoming the way she looks\nYeah you all heard about this we absolutely\nHave in fact um I Know what I Know is that she went to the homecoming day it's Eddie Murphy her name was Laura that she left demands a after forty five minutes apparently people warming to her in the day and so they did they also bully her online Darwin\nApparently they did a there'd been some terrible things said about our main show for it you know how they'll post these things because they really\nHave no self confidence in themselves that so much easier to do it on line you know [noise] but apparently she did face some of it or where she got to ask the interesting thing is um I was we were looking at the video of her today and beauty first of all is\nJust bought your face and body look like it's much deeper than that and I'd say most of us realize that but what what Kelly and I look at the pictures of her I said she is a beautiful early it Kelly says that's probably why she got tormented [noise]\nAh it's now it's time to time out here helped me understand that because I had the same reaction I was telling Kelly minute about this this morning that when I saw I saw how could how could this have happened I mean she just is it's a beautiful person yeah well\nShe she ... she is wildly I don't know her personally but apparently this really got to hurt her deeply a but she I don't know I don't know Kelly said that and to me if it meant that some people are jealous I guess\nYes if price than I Am getting I think that clearly yes I think that's exactly what Kelly Matt and I think it's a main girl came out and people yeah it's unfortunate but I think that does happen and\nYou know what a shock to me now is that this kind of thing is happening when we have\nAll these anti bullying campaigns and use constantly seem to be spreading the message is\nYou know we need to treat it sat there with respect in you know you talked about how people your beauty is not just the way you see on the outside it this kind of story makes you feel like that message is just not getting through to anybody\nBut well first of all listen at how much it hurts identical here we have some sound from a from the mother\nOr your daughter and why and how it makes them feel right well here is the the Mumbai had to say\nMy daughter was beautiful she was she was afraid to say [noise] and he's the guy says something beautiful moment meaning for me in her a maid\nAnd she she mentioned that the that the girl or was talking about how she wanted to take her life she was crying all the way home and ... and that's how bad you know uh but the reason we're talking about this on the air with Darwin's is because people heard about it on the line at local business people jumped in to try and make her feel better\nAnd I'm thinking Kelly are saying uh ... what's happened to the compassion are we getting through with these messages you know I I think we are not maybe not every student but to\nThat community saying this is unacceptable because now belts step forward their salon owners to make people or nail technicians are offered to help her get ready for\nHer next day which is coming up the the Macintosh high school which is just north of ... county [noise] they they have invited her to their prom so she is going to get the royal treatment because people in the community of heard about her story there said this is not acceptable [noise] so\nYeah it is getting through some more and more people maybe we still have to work to do on campuses but as the community as a whole\nA if we're starting their and setting an example for children than we are making some progress there may be talking to ourselves but that trickles down hopefully and ah and we're really glad that the community saying this is not\nThe right way to go this is this girl deserves better than that and hopefully that will rub off on on well she's worked Russia's got more self confident cell that she can weather the next door\nYeah here she is she this is her sounding a lot better\nI had to have like a kind of feel comfortable\nAnd I think one of many people out there\n... planning no black and within the ...\n[noise]\nWell that's good that she has this thank them 'cause that's that's also very important to show your appreciation that she's doing that which means she's a classier act and some of the people that have been attacking our online\nThat's certainly been it I don't yeah Shelley been at when I was a teenager I don't know that I listen to any advice from an adult on anything\nThat's just I mean that was just me as a teenager you could have told me ten thousand times something and I I was type of person that that had to put my hand and the fire to find out that it would burn you even know people would do that and a lot of teenagers are that way\nWell and it's not just that it's the fact that a lot of us and I did it as an adult for many years before I finally worked at through\nYou hear the bad things people say about you and when people pay you a compliment it just goes in one ear and out the other and I don't know why we do that but we all need to pay more attention to the compliment and a lot less attention to the ugliness [noise] where\n... here Darwin thank you for your time today

[noise]\nThe European Union is urging President Trump not to undo something President Reagan did I'm Dave Anthony Fox News the\nEU does not want the U.S to pull out of a Soviet era nuclear arms treaty something President Trump says he'll do Fox's John decker is a lot of the White House\nA percentage of people who are really interesting election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen [laughter] is this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nFor relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican law in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that get them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even they're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power you're going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nNow independence are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket rule but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent yup or to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being retired life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that these are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that\nWay it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... ... and I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting Saturday here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah I Know you're in ... we talked about among them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that with a wave election for Democrats [noise]\nIf it I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else does happen I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ...\nRelatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants are caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place this low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen to thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent and two dozen sick\nWe haven't had a lot of stormy fall weather in Mississippi the last couple of years but that could be changing\nSome of the outlets that we're seeing now indicate that we could be a little more active than we've seen in November in early December especially\nYou know in ... at the national weather services with this being false severe weather preparedness weak in Mississippi there'll be using a state wide tornado drill on Wednesday to remind us that after a quiet summer it's time to be thinking about storm safety again\nAnd despite some cooler weather mosquitoes in Mississippi are still biting and spreading West Nile virus\nState health department says two more cases have been reported into Soto and yell at Bush counties that brings the statewide total to forty four\nAnd a Baltimore Sunday looked like the ravens were about to send their game against the saints into overtime after scoring a touchdown with twenty four seconds to play all they needed was an extra point to tie the game\n[laughter]\n... safety network as black and gold pulled out of twenty four twenty three when Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker had made two hundred twenty two extra points in a row\nBefore missing that one Drew Brees became only the fourth quarter back in NFL history with at least five hundred touchdown pass and that's a significant milestone you through for two scores in the game and also with his first win over the ravens he joins Peyton Manning and bread far\nAs the only quarterbacks to beat every team in the league\nAnd you're up to date now a news talk one oh four nine W.

so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nActually give people's lives meaning and happiness and so I think it's very important\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worship bank because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nUm they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYet but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy Pelosi\nIn California that hundred centigrade weirdos\nDid to Mitch McConnell at a lunch hour in Kentucky exactly\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor\nAnd saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and there's no end to hear and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that met at a basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it wasn't important content but it was\nShared content ... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them\n[noise]\nSo what he is [noise] are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and\nWith dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what is unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuffed up wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia which is that happiness\nIs actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe\nThat we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about

Dave Anthony Fox News a caravan of seven thousand Central American migrants trying to get into the U.S I don't know if you're going to\nIf we can get there first of all but I my my dream and soon harder if we could\nThey get to know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people\nBetter I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness because our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time\nEverything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp\nAnd the candidates legal hang of it before I'm sure some stuff\nStarted with me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go well you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information ... ... they might do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting really sounded like testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all if you get the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible and I got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody what the work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be able to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what can I change the ... the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep schools is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and the advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr tease him I talked to vent Laurie\nI'm a doctor who then it goes back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory now he'll get yes I Do I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be a mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ...
