went off\nTo a rough start in the desert huh my goodness they're just getting smoked hey Isaac while I got a quick second let me ask you a year's a huge baseball guy\nAny concerns about her shawl year after the game on I mean that's the one they needed to when to stop the brewers hot streak now I you know your number one picture maybe it's in his head again any thoughts on if the Dodgers are officially in trouble\n[noise] uh yeah I think it's certainly valid or because Milwaukee is pitched has played so well I think the uncharacteristic thing\nIs the for errors and the past balls that struck the Dodgers he has money grunt doll and also the fact that despite all that they were still able to rally late and make it a six by the game but yeah I I mean ... has been so dominant during the regular season\nThroughout his career that whenever we as a game like this are especially like this when he's not dominant it's almost like people hold his dominance in the regular season against him a compared to what he did in the post season so Milwaukee really as the ... right now that I really do\nI think how much of this has to do with the you know the oral her ... postseason streak which was legendary and again this was like thirty I don't know maybe twenty five thirty years ago or all her ... her has this post season for the ages and\nCrush of never going to match that I mean it's just he's just not I mean the guy's been tremendous in his career but he has a one bad outing and it's like all these guys garbage that's a great point and it's\nAlmost an unfair comparison the curve Shaw has to deal with it was ... eighty eight having one of the greatest single post seasons in baseball history\nBut also Sandy Koufax because ... was so dominant during the regular season but he also had multiple signature postseason performances game one of the sixty three World Series I think he struck out sixteen in Yankee Stadium and those were the ...\nMickey Mantle Yankees and the game seven he pitches a complete game shutout on the road in sixty five World Series at Minnesota\nA complete game shutout in game seven of the world series on two days rest so that's the sort of history that people are comparing Clinton cursed shot too and that's why they're so hard on him when he has a game like you did yesterday it's weird or thanks I it's weird that\nBaseball is so hung up on the history like I mean ... is there he just was talking about stuff that happened and like what the fifties and sixties in baseball fans are just enamored with that and I think when you look at college football's there is some symmetry and they really cling to history\nThat's not the case in the NBA they just it's not people go back maybe for the Showtime Lakers in the eighties maybe to Jordan but the NBA lives in the now the NFL also not wrapped up in history I mean I Can't ... you never hear\nNFL analysis that ever a you know harkens back to bart star in the sixties or or or even like you know the seventies Steelers sometimes you'll hear about the dynasties but rarely\nDo does the NFL or NBA go back and I think that's why the NBA's super hot right now and of course the NFL's on fire and even the young people are starting to get on board with the NFL I Know the NBA's hot for young people college football's in a weird spot and let me quickly\nGo into what I think is is a bit of a refund I don't know what's going to earth and people yes I said before week one that the Michigan Wolverine the program steeped in rich history\nOne of the richest histories in college football\nThey're all they're essentially on the uh\nMount Rushmore of college football programs right if I'm if I'm going to college football programs the history using historic perspective\nYou think of Notre Dame Michigan\nGot to be Alabama and I'll leave the last one open to interpretation I'm probably spacing on somebody and Sam looks like he's chomping at the bit but the mount Rushmore of college football program Michigan Notre Dame Alabama and\nWho am I missing your as the USC waiting pick Notre Dame housed opinion and Michigan have had like\nTwo national champions one shared and like the last year to year what I said history yeah and then I didn't like historical married and I and the fair right ah Alabama us the ... have you with these kind of isn't there millennium has been a power is awesome Pete Carroll yes\n... and ... the reason I I keep coming back in Michigan as before week what\nI said that I actually thought if Jim horrible lost that game we would here and be NFL chatter again and we did\nMichigan look bad they came out slow lost to Notre Dame but in hindsight that lost is not bad Notre Dame is they'll undefeated looks like it's headed toward the college football playoff and meanwhile Michigan's been maybe because Jim ... you know talking less\nMichigan's kind of been flying under the radar have they not\nThey haven't lost since then I Know they started slow against north western a but finish strong and won by three Michigan quietly with the wind today gets right back in the college football playoff picture\nAnd I do believe we just saw Ohio State kind of struggle at Penn State I mean they needed two TVs in the final eight minutes to\nPull that out\nI think if Michigan winds today against Wisconsin and if you followed this and and I'm going to offer my picks later if you follow my college football uh picks on my pod cast coming up winters I'm On Michigan big on the line has gone up from seven and a half to ten I started tend this morning\nMichigan could blowout Wisconsin this is not your older brothers Wisconsin Badgers they're just not as good\nIf Michigan wins this\nThey have Michigan State next week now I Know that that's a big rivalry but Michigan state's not very good they just got clobbered at home by northwestern okay and then is the matchup with Penn State after a ... so I Know it's three consecutive tough games but they get a Bible for Penn State comes so if they were able to beat Wisconsin today\nAnd then Michigan takes down sporty next week there'll be considerable favorites\nAnd they would not Penn State game it all comes down to Michigan versus Ohio State for the Big Ten east and the winter you know probably will face Wisconsin I wouldn't rule out Iowa in the Big Ten championship and I'm telling you this Michigan team is starting to come around to\nKeep an eye they're asleep or no I did not sell my stock in Michigan when they lost Notre Dame but I did point this out\nShape Patterson is gonna be the difference for them to quarterback here's here's an incredible stat I dug up while I was researching Michigan Wisconsin last season Jim marble had three guys a quarterback who were just not you know they're not pro prospects they weren't very good they totaled\nMichigan three quarterbacks nine touchdowns in Thirteen game that's\nThe way through Nineteen eighty passes and Thirteen game shape Patterson this year has ten and six games he has more touchdown passes than the the all three quarterbacks had combine last year I'm telling you he's a difference maker shape Patterson in Michigan don't sleep on them\nFor the college football playoff that's the game to watch today Michigan against Wisconsin will get to pick up later we're struggling to reach Joel cloud he's calling Ohio State in Minnesota in about a few minutes we'll see if we can get them after the break\nComing up next if we can't land Mr flat my NBA previews start I'm ranking the eastern conference playoffs teams one

where the guy\nHow would you were trying to recover martial law and order this is yours [laughter] they help the customers insurance with the ...\nI'll give you the call here let's go let's go eight and go down eight and down the eighth seat in the east this year will be oh boy the Detroit Pistons this is very rough\nA lot of people taking the pistons this summer I had it as the bulls\nBut Lori market in their best player by a mile he's going to be out two months and you just I don't think there'll be able to survive that I Do like this bulls team window quarter the rookies going to be a really good player I liked jak levine you know on volition market and I would have had the bulls in there but I'm going to go Detroit Pistons as he ate the number seven\nThe Washington Wizards perpetually stuck in the forty to fifty to win area\nUnfortunately this team gave so much money to John Wall he got the supermax and they paid Bradley bill and they paid auto Porter and they can't afford to pay anyone else the steam stuck in the middle and it's unfortunate because you know\nThey ... they could have done more they have a great backward and they're not going to they're like the Portland TrailBlazers of the east but with um you were good players so the six feet in the east will be the Miami Heat now there is a bit of an Astros hear\nThe word I'm hearing is the Miami Heat are close to trading for Jimmy Butler I Know the word on the street a publicly was the talks are dead and a a guy I Know Jorge George ... said that you know pat Riley was very unhappy\nAnd cursed at I'm at uh the timber wolves guy was orchestrating the deal the word I'm hearing is the Jimmy butler could go to the heat before Halloween so keep an eye on that the next two weeks Jimmy Butler did not show up for the final preseason game\nIf the heat get butler you can bump them up from six in the east so I got Detroit eight wizard Seventy six Indiana Pacers five like the team I think they could do some damage they nearly knocked off abroad and the first round last year\nI just I don't think they're better than the fourteenth ahead of them you know there's a good pace or seen the east not as bad as it was last year number four Milwaukee Bucks it's a ah it's fashionable it's sexy\nTo take the bucks to you know get to the conference finals and Yon has to win MVP blah blah blah like no it's not happening okay I don't I don't like the direction of some of ah some of that\nThat team's internal stuff yeah I don't want to dive into it now\nI I just think the bucks have some problems that could be looming let's just say that not not immediately but suit and they're definitely not better than the top three teens number three the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers\nAssuming they can write this ... ah thing and and I don't know why they wouldn't put ... on the tray block and make a run a Jimmy Butler uh I I Know that's early to self ... he hasn't even played fifty games but I I just the stuff I'm hearing I don't love I Would\nDangle him for Jimmy ... I don't think Philly will but they could um I have Philly is the third best team in the east they're probably another fifty fifty five wins number two the Toronto Raptors now I'll say this\nI didn't like the Toronto Raptors trade for co why but it could work out this is a deep team okay the Toronto Raptors have a lot of talent\nA lot of good talent there one thing they could not overcome and the ease with LeBron and guess what he gone so I actually like to Toronto Raptors to win fifty\nFifty five games or in that ballpark how they do have a new head coach and they got a new number one in ... we'll see what happens number one in the east there's no doubt about it the\nBoston Celtics I think they could touch sixty five to seven he wins they're that good they are the deepest team in the league they have three ... Kyrie Gordon Hayward and yes Jason date him as an alpha I Love to see\nI've never been a Celtics fan in any way shape or form but I just loved his team I like Kyrie a like a word I Love date I'm Jay Lynn brown Brad Stevens is the best coach in the league\nOr in the east I'll say public they still got to give them props for that so there is Boston one Toronto to Philly three Milwaukee for indie five Miami six Washington seven Detroit eight will do the west in one hour coming up next year on the\nBig lead Fox Sports radio mom man th joined us super contest pick [noise]\n\nIt's been milder here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea of what's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you couldn't be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that's extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us try we're going to give new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar\nNo caps and no catches because we know if you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it I discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new car members limitations applied\nThinking what is the world's worst wherever you are with the IRA radio I\nThought well for nine dot com\nTo the bottom of it I'm Pam who sell Fox News that's my president Trump is promising when it comes to the fate of missing journalist Washington Post contributor to mount ... hasn't been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second officials in Turkey allege he was murdered something Saudi Arabia denies\nPresident Trump was asked about the allegations during an interview with CBS has sixty minutes\nThere's a lot of sick and [noise]\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nThat clip on Fox and friends the president says he plans to speak soon by phone with the Saudi king\nIt shouldn't be too much longer before in American pastor held in Turkey for nearly two years is back on us soil Andrew Brunson is scheduled to arrive at joint base Andrews near Washington around noon eastern Brunson was flown to Germany for us all physical and released a statement to coincide with his arrival\nThis is a day our family has been praying for I'm delighted to be on my way home to the United states [noise] my entire family thinks the president and his regime and Congress\nFox is generally and Turner yesterday Brunson was convicted of having links to terrorism but he was released due to time served\nDesperately needed food and water are getting a police escort in the panhandle region or Florida or hurricane Michael decimated entire neighborhoods earlier this week Fox is Jonathan ... is in Panama City\nEven structures that survived the extreme when suffered extensive water damage from storm surge air force officials say nearby tend to air force base suffered widespread catastrophic damage in the storm although they evacuated approximately fifty at twenty two fighter jets in advance of the hurricane some planes had to be left behind in hangers\nThe storm now blamed for at least Seventeen deaths death is Fox News [noise]\n\n[noise] he was one off or not whether here's your accuweather forecast this afternoon beautiful with plenty of sun in the hive eighty four and I played a part of the time he was a low of Seventy mile partly sunny and\nVery warm or the high of a nine to ... to ... below Seventy three and among his son then turning cloudy and very warm of the shower someone spots in a high eighty nine an accurate there's Gregory Patrick\nMore beautiful new custom build muscle or home that's more affordable than traditional construction Segal board home center not only are there homes more affordable but they also take less time to build and are completely customize them all new to local codes they have a residential looking ... our energy efficient and they appreciate in value porches in our\nHearts are available as well as I feel finance\nIn ... center is on highway forty nine just south of here in central and on Facebook at Gulfport home center [noise] the dean's list with Janice doing a waitress\nAt and North Carolina Olive Garden makes today's dean's list as the mom of an Eighteen month old baby Courtney ...

market started off as corrections I think this one is probably embarrass market is long overdue but you know Donald Trump said that the fed has gone crazy\nHe's wrong they didn't just go crazy they'd been crazy for a long time it was crazy to lower insurance rates down to zero it was even crazier to leave them there for as long as they did\nThe only sane thing they've done is to raise them back up but what is crazy is for the fed to believe that they can raise interest rates without breaking their own bubble which is exactly what they've done this is a bigger level than the one that blew up in two thousand and eight\nAnd the crisis that is going to win so it's going to be far larger\nYou know you mentioned earlier in the show that hey in the past people were able to pay higher interest rates that was true because we didn't have all this that face the fed and cheap money we have more debt than ever before individuals corporations the government is loaded up with dad and his interest rates go up that that is on serviceable\nYeah and as the ... the interest rates go up and go back to what is a normal level levels that don't have distortions on the rest of the market around it we're going to get out of the regime we've been in for a decade when they slam that interest rate down starting in two thousand eight and they got it down to just about zero zero zero point two five percent\nWhat that does is it rewards\nDebt and punishes saving\nWhat's the point of saving your money you have no incentive to save your money or less incentive to save your money if you're not going to get any interest on it and the difference between zero point two five percent and you know getting three or four percent on your money that's idol\nIt's huge it's absolutely huge and so what are you gonna do you're going to necessarily have to put that money at some sort of risk you're going to have to have a trade off either lock it up and lose liquidity or go to a a risky tool and take it off the table\nIn order to get some sort of you in order for you to continue the financial plan that you had where you're going to say this money and I'm going to grow it\nSo you you punish saving people are not saving and they're not saving into say fashion you encourage risk taking there's risk that are being taken that nor ordinarily been taken which means people are going to lose a lot more ... because once you get past all the ... what's left well but not so sure of the risky\nStuff and then on the other side what's the harm and taken out debt\nAnd that encourages people to borrow money to to go on these adventurous a uses of scarce capital resources that they otherwise would not have been able to do\nHad the rates not been this low and so you had money artificially coming out of bonds because they're worthless you had money artificially being pushed into stocks\nAnd where am I here here's my prediction ... uh Peter Schiff a guy smarter than me knows more about this than me and he's made a billion dollars so his track record a lot better than mine but he says this this very well well maybe a bear market\nIf he's right and he may be I think this I think we're about to see this weird confluence that hasn't happened in my lifetime and I don't think it's ever happened in the stock market\nWhere you see GDP Growth still going up but the stock market going down and I don't mean is losing ah it's it's I had a bad week I mean go bare\nYou're going to have them move not in unison but in opposition because other thing that we have going on right now that's a big head went on stock market not necessarily the rest of the economy just the stock market is he's rising interest rates\nRight and then the quantitative tightening member quantitative easing well this is on doing that\nYou know wearing quantitative easing they're basically buying up all these uh acids and no one else wanted so money was just coming out of this vault that the fed has that no one even knows that they're ... and she says but it was being thrown the economy will now that were unloading that balance sheet it's basically sucking money liquidity capital out of the economy [noise]\nAnd it's sort of a de facto deflation not that prices are about to go down but the money supply is getting smaller it's shrinking\nCompared to productivity [noise]\nBy coming up next more winning it life with Gregory
