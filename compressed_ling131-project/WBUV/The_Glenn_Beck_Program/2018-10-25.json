V. in Biloxi\nCanton on news radio seven ten WINZ I'm a Ninety nine and five FM the dragon mobiles\nRevenues headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to that we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singles and Darwin good morning\nGood morning to both of you on this very wet Thursday because um well the remnants of hurricane ... has\nHad finally made their way here and I think Jay car meteorologist this morning calling for maybe one\nTo three inches of rain along the Gulf Coast in some places okay we're going to have a way when you ask carefully last last week I think it was like three days ago we had a light rain people were running into each other rereading each other all over town right it's crazy\nIt is um ah now there's a story that I Want to ask you about because we've all along the Gulf Coast been trying to help the people in Florida they hit hit by the hurricane and we've all done lots of ... drives to to gather supplies for people and you've got a story today about how people are stealing hurricane supplies\nAll right this is out of Niceville, Florida and and list there was a in Mississippi and Alabama we try to find stories that interest both sides of the state line and I think this one does because we've all been through some sort of hurricane stripes uh and and this one\nA ... disk around because the end justifies the uh the action or they're called porch pirates this was over Niceville, Florida of course you know that's right on the edge of the hurricane Michael Storm\nArea and a lot of the victims are out there waiting for anything they can they can use so there's this UPS truck that makes a delivery at a house and nice full and\nYou get you see the video this this home security camera video and the UPS guy stacks these boxes up\n[noise] uh on the doorstep and drives away well while he's doing that when you look at the background of the video and we have this that I Am the sea Fifteen dot com you might want to look at it or you see these young\nGuys and some a little bit older are riding bicycles in the neighborhood you know just riding around scope and things out they were looking at the truck you see the truck drive away you see them go out a picture for a minute then they come back and Kelly what do you think they do\nThey take the packages\nThey go you see them get off their bicycles they go up there like just as if they were right now there's packet just because apparently they were and they just stack up because there's a lot of them and they\nThey ride off with all of these things are going wow that's a lot of stuff to carry All right and that's that that makes you angry because\nThe person that lifted that house as a member of crowdsource rescue it's a nationwide group that gets items shipped to them from strangers to help out in the hurricanes and the aftermath and then they deliver and to the disaster victims um but\nHere's the funny part the thieves didn't know what was in there what was in there were lots of depends and feminine hygiene products\n[laughter]\nOkay heart kind of difficult to fend [laughter]\nWell and certainly not I I don't know if they can use that were not perhaps it depends will come in handy if they get caught and I gotta feeling there will because it was very good so maybe in jail they could use it appear as not quite sure what they're going to do list yeah hygiene products but nonetheless\nUh they didn't get the big prize that they thought they would get they've found these things so stroke on the side of the road so they got a lot of it back or not the bounty that they were expecting but just enough to perhaps landed him in jail because when I\nTell you the ... you have to go see the video that that was your your your uncle or your son or your cousin you could take 'em out did you say so ugly undercutting yourself of\nYeah and and you think about hum of all the things to go to jail for for ... and it just stealing a case of depends for suffering from our hurricane\nYeah what's with that I mean come on now so uh that's just like a just a double black\nMark on your a jail record I think they should put a notation and there whenever something's really really bad or stupid they should go in there so we know who we are dealing with with these people uh uh uh to go to jail or go to court just adds a little extra yeah\nYou know shame shame on you to the to the prosecution I think that story caught my eye\nBad enough Darwin did you hear about these scammers they take it\nAn Egyptian situation like people trying to recover from a hurricane and then you hear stories like this\nAnd you know there has been looting and uh yeah it's just [noise] man\nMeanwhile meanwhile hundreds of people perhaps there we saved thousands are busy over there trying to get people on their\nFeet and you know we try to tell their stories whenever we can but quite frankly there's so many people try to help that we just can't do 'em all so what happens is you wind up doing stories on the few people who are making trying to make it miserable for everybody else so that's\nThat's why there's so many good people doing good things that we just can't get to a mall so we\nYou know sometimes we have to focus on the people who are hindering them and that's kinda why these people get their day in the sun although it's not a pretty day\nNo it's All right well not at all we're at a time here but thank you for your time today oh sure\nOh I think everybody is out there doing good things and donating and are you guys are the real uh unsung heroes and we appreciate it\nAbsolutely Darwin thank you very much again for joining us here on Gulf Coast mornings we're at a time for this segment of the\nProgram [noise] or you can always

[noise]\nPackages number eight and nine I'm Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one male the former vice president Biden looking very similar to all the other ones that the Democrats another turned up at five AM in New York City\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her done except none of your bombs get it done\nNone\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go piss dam road runner keeps going getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros\nDoes every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen Wylie\nCoyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone new exact\nWhat they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however is not stopping\nThe left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I did go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force\nOne to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at\nThe time I don't even know and as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate if you don't\nKnow you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything\nEverything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus a left wing person trying to Iran for every body up what would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\nYou do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\nOver to her man well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it it it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb\nThe most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of ... when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous than a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need [laughter]\n[laughter] right [noise] um but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nThey said they did detect some of that and there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to them the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and\nSerious the situation but there was a level of sophistication level is supposed to catch him\nBecause he had vent or or she by the way he or she had a hit send 'em some of these bombs to home offices and\nAnd residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would\nDefinitely be school until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and are fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter]\nGet the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they didn't have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or ... or service at their whole right\nThey get older male you you have private

anymore they're not good enough doesn't matter where in the throes of\nCultural lawlessness executions on demand contacts commonsense doesn't matter execute them hang them getting rid of them\nI guess what's happening next\nShe dropped by ca I think she was dropped by her talent agency she's a pariah now\nShe's a pariah\nAnd people will say on the right good really good\nGood people on the left\nGood how Megan Kelly affected anyone's life\n\nWell she has made it very difficult\nFor NBC to live down their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices she keeps bringing that up she was very serious and one of the biggest critic of NBC and the way they handled some of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way or they\nSeem to be to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that\nShe said which is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know\nThat they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy or but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and maybe Kelly happens to me one of the biggest critics of what happened at NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks there is no place on our\nAir or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I add that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who\nTake offense at the slightest thing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last\nPlace probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter]\nOh you should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not we are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay is she was she looks like a million address with a bomb it okay she she ...\nShe also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face\nAnd ... and kept going she didn't wine she didn't cry about it she's like oh\nCrap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked my eye out\nShe moved beyond that to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes\nThings have changed we're evolving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly ought to know that blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I see a ... question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why\nWhy is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong that that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how\nAre we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river\nIf she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nAnd this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thoughts crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crime stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with the propositions the party says the earth is flat\nThe party says that ISIS heavier than water and trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something\nUnexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind the world we want to end up in\nUnfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is
