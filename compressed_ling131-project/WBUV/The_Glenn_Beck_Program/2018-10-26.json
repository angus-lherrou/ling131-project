{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "And Ninety nine five back then the jak immobile news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Darwin singleton of NBC Fifteen do a good morning\nGood morning I Hope you guys are having a great friday now that the rains out of the way we can start and joining the fair weather and Halloween\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nAnd and not quite Mardi Gras weather but but we're getting there too or bought maybe three months away yeah\nYeah um yeah I saw the story that NBC Fifteen had you had Cassie fan real reporting on this where are the the the mayor's administration immobile had some discussions with parade organizations about going up on the parading face for Mardi Gras\nYou hurt and masks hitting the floor along with chickens when that happens [laughter]\nYeah and not by just not just by ... dollars either by a they usually charged about a thousand or so I think it's twenty five dollars processing the or something like that to five grand was a suggestion a and some of these crews\nAre are not wealthy cruise I mean in fact I I hear that story I'm hearing a lot of stuff from inside that meeting now which by the way a lot of people didn't know what it's about they showed up [noise] um I think it was uh about ten groups are so said that they\nThey wouldn't be able to parade if they did that we're we're very close to Mardi Gras right now so ... what basically happened after we aired our store yesterday we got a call from the mayor's office says nothing's going to be done before the twenty ninth team parades role but they're looking at it\nAnd I'm also hearing they ask them how much they could pay and said I'm so well maybe five hundred but not five grand\nYou know an increase [noise] so uh but but luckily Henry you know some of these new groups uh Mardi Gras is grown some of these new groups are actually read their floats they parade with other organizations because they don't they're not big enough they can't afford it and some of the newer parades\nA are either a ... they're either mixed race or they're a minority members are members of the American community right that because it's been basically white organizations downtown so where are you going to do\nIf some of these have can't afford it\nThen you're going to basically return downtown parades to just basically an all white a bit except you know as far as participants in the parade that's about the direction that the city was going no and I don't think they thought about that I don't know if they have it out if they're trying to save the hurt because they feel they have Janine parades but that's what will happen\nDarwin that is that is a big consideration one that I hadn't even considered until you just brought it up but when I saw this story I just remembered I Would say most of my life living in this area I have heard arguments about how big an economic impact Mardi Gras has\nAnd how we we generate all this money is generated with people coming into town staying in a hotel spending so much money involving Mardi Gras if that's true\nWhy would you ever go up on the parade fee\nWell here's the deal it costs the ... the police chief told us last night it costs about forty one thousand dollars for the city to throw a parade every night during Mardi Gras about forty one grand and so that sounds like a lot of money [noise]\nUh but there was a study done back in two thousand for\nA and I found it this morning on of all things some of the carnival museum site and I think Steve joint immobile mass is the story several years ago or ... maybe the mobile press register did it but it's been quoted by ... there'll be a mask or that shows the tremendous hundreds hundreds of millions of dollars\nThat are spit immobile involving county\nOn Mardi Gras and then when you multiply it by\nA by how it's spent over and over you're getting your getting toward a ... billion bucks and\nIt also represents about a six percent of the entire states a tourism or a ... income it's it's it's huge I mean I I Know mobile gets an amazing amount of hotel\nMoney and a tax dollars are just retail uh income at ... sorry sales tax uh-huh\nIt's it's something most cities would gladly at best and so and of course I'm a Mardi Gras fan I Would bet it's I'm a big supporter of the of the crews and the government itself and everybody knows that it's no secret so\nIt it it ... sounds me to to try to figure out why you would bite the hand that feature\nYeah and not be that would be but Darwin come on I mean a little increase I can understand like twenty fifty bucks or something like that but to jump from a thousand five thousand and one meeting wow wow\nThey're out there and I understand they they said also okay if you can't pay that how much you pay and I said well we might as I got married five hundred bucks we certainly can't do that kind of at\nGreat well yeah I just I I'm I'm back to the to the to the basic why would you if it generates just what you you mentioned that that that study mhm a few years ago why on earth would you ever\nThat you should go somewhere else to find whatever money you're looking for but this as you say yes Kelly better shouldn't you love the fee to make the event even welder\nWell yeah I I it it is already big but I mean look at the college I we always say look at New Orleans I mean\nI'm sure that they pay quite a bit of this but there are cities built on that if you want to see that study that read that story I got it on my uh NBC fifteenth by station's Facebook page I Believe that there\nWere at a time Darwin have a great weekend there to their egos Darwin singles and

O. J. against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared to you know\nPresident Obama was putting new people in Chapel Hill he was what\n... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nThere's a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this or you just want you to just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five novelists\nImagine Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the Mueller investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAndy you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come as a surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was\nNot guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're suppose investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe it's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how\nIs it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the

been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your able feeling beatings and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it\nWas very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nAnd like Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do\nHe doesn't it surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very ...\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter\nYes he fights back but now they're turning it around saying well your\nYour fight back Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where they were not responsible for any of it all in all of us now I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people\nUnderstand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh [noise]\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us\nFrom the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this ... this was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy\nCould be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man [laughter] which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press ricin needs to all of the all of the enemies of the right or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence with midterms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out or the or Washington DC think tanks progressing think tanks they send stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this um may be the person sending it was insane ah you know that kinda thing they'll never say well gee maybe um our side\nIs so craves now that we have to

this morning I'm Dave Anthony one was intercepted in Florida address the Democratic senator Cory Booker the other was sent a former director of national intelligence turn Trump critic James Clapper founded a post office in New York City\n\nAnd I was unable to deal with the anguish\n\nI remember a story of being told by instructor in the military being told of convoy that was ambushed after having a Humvee take a hit from an ... he was treated um he was a treated and the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee\nTo be met in fact out one of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow when he was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that the was unable to walk the man and looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic\nThat that helped him that his arm was fine and this wasn't his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lie to myself my daughter was fine this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what in the fall when my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks\nIt wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing only wanted to do after she told me about this was find is that this guy and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n\n\nOh how I hated and wanted to hate this young man I wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know that in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak\nThat I I realized that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me\nI needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted yes the pain of what happened still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by might hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\n\nChristian as a um [noise] as a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\nAnd I thank God we caught it before anything happened I understand I understand\n\nWe knew the address of the man who um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\n\nI think about it all the time to\n\nThink about my children all the time\nAnd\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me or I haven't talked to my wife about it\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\nThere are things that we don't want to think about that are truly frightening and I think\nWhen we look at our country when we look and we really realize\nWhy do we really stand to lose it's not our job is not our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us and happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said if somebody if you said to everybody you met and the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up I think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors and boundaries\n\nWe're all struggling with something and we all have something big to forgive that man we don't want to\n\n\nBut the reality

have to endure endure life is endurance\nLife is about the long run not the short run\nEndure it to the end they hated that that you're always so pessimistic now I'm not I'm telling you that there's a lot in life that you're going to have to endure that you're going to hate life is not what do you think it is when you're a kid it's just not\nIt's harder than that but it's so worth it\nBut we need to be like a cross country team\n\nFor going to survive this we don't cheer the person who came across first we cheer the person who came across the finish line the last as well\n\nBecause we're all
