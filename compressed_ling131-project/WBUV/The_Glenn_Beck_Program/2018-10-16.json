I'm going all full\nI I'm I'm just I'm going to I just thought let's all complain about the names of out both teams but let's let let how wild out already or\nFrom here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it does the\nI mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he ... I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they just didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any\nDNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not getting participating in DNA studies we don't want any DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test\nThe DNA against we have to use\nPeople from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood and it's not even what they tested a and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if\nYou if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nRight like that's not the way this works they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does it it shows a lineage again shows it it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a Robert\nFriends ... [laughter] it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's interesting you know\nFrom that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um\nIt was her great great great great grandmother I think\nSeveral generations back and um when she registers in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there was a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now I'm not denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we\nCan't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is\nSo we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care\nI don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them\nOr I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is not my ... my grandfather actually took a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay\nSo in my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing ya oh yeah this is what it was\nBut it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls when I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've\nYou've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why it is yeah I can give you that I got what it's about it I give you that I found a huge story I mean ... you know we well\nKnow what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as ...\nOr to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation using a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal air at the edge okay look not a good look yeah they're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should probably\nZip it and it does not go on this whole saga of the last two days when the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning signs to Democrats to not nominate her this is\nA oh no no no no I look I Want to know\nThis is this is a

to\nGo out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about

don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has hinted in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government tea has he has called for in ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not\nHe's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd have around it by ... so a haze closest advisors today are a military so as an exception is a follow get just a that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is a liberal so we have several\nDefenses regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's at his a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points that out as\nA base of the trust in his government but\nUh he said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very close government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tool [noise]\n... this is the kind of ... the kind of the same thing that you a job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately uh came in and he started taking over the media and and the nationalizing everything is [noise] is there um\nIs that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as a military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil what\nWe expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as hail we'll uh take office and\nImmediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has a\nSuggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution from Brazil and that would be submitted to a vote or after eight so and in ... to to people to ah electors in general so\nIt he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office because the fact is that he's not going to debate he is giving a\nJust a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut analyst most analysts\nDon't expect something so drastic at\nRight at the time including because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governors melody and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son it ... and he posted online a while back a photo of him and next to Bannon and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help\nIn the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a boat so NATO himself a came to a public\nAfterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what we know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidates an\nA and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\n...

being the massive check\nOn um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but it would that amount of power us and uh you know again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel\nDoesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know\nIs a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do it can stop the worst of the things that are as an ... year presidents presidents do what do you do\nI uh [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nResigned [laughter] I Know ah I think um you have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do hum\nI think are over there were the king the king says she's screw up total screw up this\nGuy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died and then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe in these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we did it\n... I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here\nIs that uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping\nThe Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's let's clear that up this isn't it the Saudi Arabia is really ... and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "16"}
