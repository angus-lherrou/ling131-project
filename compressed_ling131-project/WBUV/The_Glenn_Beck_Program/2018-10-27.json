[noise]\nYou know being in this business this is the greatest business in the world um I I Can't I Can't even imagine doing anything else and in ... but they're the definite clear downside is is uh the abuse of the product um this is\nThis is not selling ground beef this is not selling you know I'm a rice and beans\nAre product is one that can bring great great joy and an enhanced life um you know in in in wonderful ways but there's also a downside when it when it's abused and and I I read the stories like everybody else and I have a family like everybody else and that hurts\n[noise] how do you celebrate with your team around here\nUm well a whole bunch of different ways small and in a small and\nBig we uh we we just celebrated a few months in a row and and ah you know did the barbeque thing in a few beers uh that's that's a pretty regular water around here and then we've done bigger stuff to like we uh we we took our management team to Costa Rica building a building homes for folks down there\nTell me more about that I mentioned that to me in the past and it's\nBeen a remarkable story well hooked up with a group by a code ... with a mission and homes of hoping they build homes um in in just these incredibly impoverished communities around the world\nAnd we ended up going down to Costa Rica to fifty of our managers and their spouses and um went down there spent I guess two days on the build and um you know changed the lives of two families down there and in this this very very poor community but\nChanged the lives of a lot of our people too and that was that was a part of a celebration and you know team building and that kinda thing and um it's it's one that sticks with you did you say fifty people yeah fifty people\nThat's right so you're a company of a hundred and fifty people twenty foreign managers ... found us exactly or at a big percentage of the workplace was going to go build homes in Costa Rican yesterday and we're still paying for it [laughter]\nIs that where you're going no one on one for is what a significant investment in a celebration as well as our certain there's some sort of\nI don't know if it would ever be referred to this team building component to that sure\nWell that's that's that's what it was really about celebrating and and um you know bringing people together working together outside of this business and in a way that was really meaningful it's exactly what it did\nBut you know up a part of that too comes from the family business aspect of this thing and the fact that because we are a family business we have a different we have a different arc uh\nWhen do we think of the timeline of our business you know we're sticking multigenerational we're not ... necessarily thinking quarter to quarter [noise] um so when you're doing that you get to think about things in your people a little bit differently\nYeah no kidding and um it's a remarkable story in a generous\nGenerous thing from you or you said you're still paying for it I don't know if that was true or not true but it's an incredible story nevertheless so the next time any one of the listeners walk down the beer oil what do you want them to see what I Would lie for them\nTo see as a bowl bud and Bud Light and ... and all of our products full and cold and ready for them to grab one and by yet\nSo just simply recognize the brands and take

totally agree I mean listen last year they started five and then they cratered and lost six or seven before rebounding late to win four straight and\nJust wonder my only question I'm going to give the chiefs you know one of those spots that when the super bowl their team that can but\nWe've seen ... homes you know in baseball you go once it was the order and you mow down everybody in your feeling good okay the the hitters they're picking up some things maybe second time through the order you give up a couple of ... and then the third time you get lit up\nI Do wonder and it starts this weekend have we seen enough among homes can defenses adjust after seven weeks of getting killed by pat ... homes are they going to adjust well we'll see what Andy Reid will do\nI think the chiefs of one of the four teams that can win the super bowl now the other two the patriots dish don't argue with me folk we know in September\nThey use it as kind of a pre season to fine tune things go wrong is going to bat return and he's going to get back\nMonday Night against the bills Julian Edelman healthy\nI think they've scored over thirty points in each of the last like four games they're back so it's the patriots the chiefs the rams and the other team you know they didn't start out consistent\nBut man right now they are mowing down people and that's the New Orleans say uh I I thought last week's game if you guys watch that closely I thought Sean Payton coached the best game of the NFL season okay they didn't I don't think ... point until late in the second quarter\nOn the road against the best defense in the NFL he made adjustments made some tweaks and remember the region to not allow the fourth quarter I'm Sorry the second half touched down the season\nThe saints had two in the fourth quarter to on the road now I Know just in Tucker missed the extra point or we go to Jean overtime but what I saw from the states was a consistent effort they didn't start out consistently on the but now we've seen it the sample sizes bigger I think the same\nI think they can win the Superbowl I think they're right there with the ... the patriots and the rams now\nBefore I get to a and I want to I Want to play the walk off home run called here for a second uh for the Dodgers Red Sox game will play that on one second but I just want them I Know some people out there are going to be like well what does that Jason ... what about the chargers was LA Chargers ... well listen\nI haven't seen the consistency yet they beat up on a lot of bad deems\nWe saw an inconsistent effort last week in a London against Tennessee wait and see what the chargers still wait and see what the Houston Texans\nStill wait and see with Cam Newton and the Panthers and then the two teams that I think are closest to getting in that upper echelon or the Steelers who've been there before let me see them put it on the browns beat them convincingly not another five turnovers Big Bend\nAnd of course the Minnesota Vikings we we know they started slow\nStarting to rebound but if you look at the injury report the Vikings are beat up this week if they're able to come out\nAnd pull off his victory against they they'll get in that upper echelon so lot of interesting NFL stuff and just remember that you're not consistent until you're good now can we play the Dodgers walk off call from last night the Eighteen

Rondo when the starting lineup I don't really think it matters as much now the closing line up is what matters because the Lakers were in that game against the rockets with about\nFive minutes left seven minutes left as a one point game\nAh the Lakers were in that game against the spurs now Rondo was suspended for that one and uh they were in that game in Portland it was a one point game or like four or five minutes left so the closing line up at ... needs to focus on I think you guys have it wrong alright\nComing up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio\nI got to say I know a lot of people out there are backing\nWhat Jerry Jones did bring in and I'm Ari Cooper dude I if folks just wait a minute I just think logically about this okay you know the phrase short term gain long story short term pain\nLong term gain well it goes both ways and that applies to the American portrayed we'll talk about that next but first\nHere's Isaac low impossible latest toward Jaycee said it was a mere seven hours in two minutes ago that the Dodgers in Red Sox were battling\nIt at the bottom of the Eighteenth ending in game three of the world series when max monthly the Dodgers came to the plate with Joe Buck at the microphone on Fox [laughter]\nGod\n\nEighteen innings seven hour twenty minutes ethic was the longest game in World Series history and Red Sox now lead the series two games to one game for tonight at eight o nine eastern there's report presented by true car hotline car shopping can be confusing none anymore\nWithdrew fresh drew car now you know the exact price you pay for your next car so it was a true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience [noise]\nNBA friday night Kevin Iran scored forty one and Madison Square garden in golden state's twenty eight point victory over the next\nTo ramp scored twenty five in the fourth quarter out scoring the Nixon the period by himself and Milwaukee may nineteenth threes thirty point where the Minnesota the bucks five ... for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two here the deer and a half the bacteria they you Isaac [noise] uh back\nYou're on the big lead Fox Sports radio I Am your host Jason mcentire coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on par insurance with guy go\nGo to guy go duck comical one eight hundred nine four seven auto the only our part figuring out which way is easier hey ah Isaac interesting thing ah talking about the Milwaukee Bucks there so I'm doing my first fantasy basketball yes I back in fantasy for the NBA first time in years huh\nAnd I miss the beginning of the draft because I was watching Ozark with my wife and and we weren't paying attention so I start getting ... where are you the draft started\nAnd for some reason I auto picked Younis as the first big overall I spent like Seventy seven dollars I was like oh my gosh there goes my team I got no chance\nYacht us has been dominant and I'm just rolling through the first week it's a pretty listen I I didn't realize this but John us he just does everything blocks steals we know he's a great player and the top ten guy in the league but for fantasy basketball is amazed\nOh he's a he's one of the best values overall in all of fantasy sports when you think about his versatility\nOoh that's all I Know that's a hot take all of fantasy sports so I don't play fantasy baseball\nUm and I will say this listen I don't know how much people talk fantasy sports on the radio but I got a guy at the big league covers media Ryan glass and he's great he does a great job by the way why yeah hopefully ... a lot of stories very inside yeah Europe ... hearing that nice how nice of you to say a Isaac\nBut he's been telling me that there should be more fantasy discussions on television and radio and here's why because women don't necessarily gamble\nBut they will play a lot of fantasy sports and if you could do a fantasy minute every day at such and such time we're a fantasy football segment Buddhist starred Hooters dude who to pick up on the waiver wire where are you guys again and I know this wasn't on our our list of topics but it just hit me like\nDo you do you do a lot of ... I Love it I I and when you brought up famously basketball it makes me happy 'cause you're a fellow degenerate like me I [laughter]\nI I enjoy all fantasy sports although I have I I might be doing with baseball for a little bit now because it's a little bit too long ago this season but um yes I Am absolutely all in on fantasy content and are interesting you know maybe we can do something here as\nWell um yeah that's possible fantasy a fantasy updates we'll see yeah look let's put it on the list of things to do um however I Want to give quickly to the uh Mari Cooper trade this week\nAnd I know people who are out on the cowboys like the America's Team stuff that seems to be over right they're they're not America's ... nobody really cares about the cowboys at this point they're just not as interesting as they used to be his IQ you'll Eliot his tone down his act a lot remember he was like\nMr up in the club all hanging out with the ladies will once\nHad that incident that he got suspended for and I should add that was such a terrible suspension by the NFL sorry it was just bad like when the NFL's lead investigator said yeah we shouldn't suspend them the evidence here is kind of flimsy and they suspend them anyway you know it's a bad suspension but I digress\nThe cowboys has gotten kind of boring good at home stink on the ... you're not good and the you're consistent\nOh they're not consistent so what was interesting was after the eagles last Sunday\nAnd then the cowboys also blew a game in Washington it was still like well they didn't lose any ground and I feel like Jerry Jones kinda sorta panicked because he pulled the trigger on a trade\nFor a Mari Cooper now in top off the top your edge like oh I'm Ari Cooper that's when it was the first round pick out Alabama great player pump the brakes\nThis is the guy who had a high dropout rate he's had dropped passes have been a major issue for a Mari Cooper he's very talented the highlight reel if you just go to YouTube and look up I'm Ari Cooper highlights that the raiders you're like wow this guy can play well there's no doubt\nHe can play he is just a drop machine and then the bigger picture emerges and I said\nThe cowboys made a short term gain and they're going to experience some long term pain here this is not in the big picture a good deal now the opposite is true\nFor the raiders and John good they're going to go through a lot of short term pain but in the long run trading a little Mac\nTrading Omari Cooper long term game now I Know you guys know about this in life you know I like to use just um analogy where you're getting an argument with your wife and you know you're right\nBut she's beginner hills in and there's a there's a point where you ... it just clicked you're like I I got to stop I got a letter had this round you win this round\nWin the battle but I Want to win the war so I'm just going to concede and pull that you've got to play the I'm not saying he played games with your wife but this is real life like sometimes you got to just pull back because of the bigger picture and I think John ... well our team stinks\nWe need to get rid of some players were not going anywhere marsh John Lynch is now in the eye are by the way thank you to my fantasy team march on lunch for nothing and if you look at the big picture they're not good now there probably won't be very good next year but ah they have three first round draft picks next year\nJohn doing as a ten year contract they're going to Las Vegas in two years this is clearly a tear down for\nJohn good and and I didn't love the ... trade\nBut I guarantee you in two years we'll be looking at this being like oh this is a good move for grown now on the flip side Jerry Jones\nI just think long term this is a disaster folks ... we talked about it all summer this is the year for jak Prescott if ... good he gets a big contract but\nIf he gets a big contract how are you going to pay the Marcus Lauren\nHow are you going to pay in a couple of years ... how are you going to pay a Mari Cooper he's done a rookie deal for now but he's going to want to get paid you can't franchise tag everybody\nAnd some of these bombs\nAnd at the beginning I didn't really notice it and then my wife's like yeah I'm\n... every woman is trying to do the sexy thing here\nAre some of the interesting outfits I saw someone who is Ruth Bader Ginsburg obviously she wasn't sexy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Supreme Court and her husband dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh [laughter] ah the guy who got I'm simply because [noise] um yeah I Know it was what he had like a hat with like beer\nAnd whatever it was it the other day I Will he did have a gamble yeah there was uh what else do we see Steve Nash would there the hall of fame or he was dressed up as one of the cobra chi\nOr from karate kid it was a pretty good outfit a there was a guy who dressed up as the new Jurassic Park here oh what's his name Chris oh ... ... yes and then his partner was uh the group to read from that movie\nUm who's very attractive and of course she was the sexy Jurassic Park girl uh what else did I see I saw an up pretty woman Julia Roberts the one the hooker Julia Roberts from early in that movie where she was wearing nothing\nThere was a there was well [laughter] the the sexy flight attendant was immensely popular um I think I felt like to want to be scarlet Joe Hansen's like where they got the wig\nAnd it was like the scarlet Johanson yoga teacher in that he's not that into you have you seen that movie did not know that one first of all it's

means you probably should have gone to Geico dot com Fifteen minutes ago right so quickly wanted to touch on this Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota so all of a sudden this week I don't know if you guys noticed it out of the blue because it had kinda\nWeek or ten days rockets offering for first round pick\nAnd you're like well and that that can't be real the rockets are not that stupid\nYou know the last team to gave up that many picks was the net in that cagey or Paul Peirce steel and of course the nets are still paying the price for that and of course the Celtics potential dynasty that they have\nI mean it's being built on the back of one free so there's no I just don't buy that deal but I Do wonder\nIf one team floated it and the team I'm guessing is the timber wolves because they got to get Jimmy Butler out of town I think they've got to get him curled Anthony town who looked like he was on the verge of stardom last year\nIs a train wreck your now of course there were rumors I don't want to dive too deep into this 'cause it's unfounded that correlate the town's was dating a woman\nAnd then the woman allegedly broke up with them and then the woman was spotted like in Europe with Jimmy Butler so there there's something happened in the locker room because towns is a train wreck Wiggins is mysteriously hurting now and they got smoked last night by thirty\nThirty by the book they were not even competitive\nI actually wonder if the Houston Rockets act you know they really wanted that or are they seeing whoa wait a second or ... thirty three he's always hurt James ...

apolitical show sure we have our own opinions but we try and keep them off the show and keep politics off the show as much as possible however\nOne overlaps with things that directly affect your wallet when things that affect not just you've with other people in our audience that you might not be on prescriptions but a lot of people are\nAnd a lot of people will be\nA so Trump had a little announcements on the twenty fifth let's just say Thursday but\nI'm so he he wanted to covers three things he has a three pronged approach to lowering prescription drug prices and according to him he's already done two of them and then he's on his third now\nAnd it's great that he comes out and tells us because the news is always so infatuated with the the outrage of the week that a lot of this stuff is going on under the radar so the first thing he talked about is ah the approval rate of generics and that is one of the things\nThat brings drug prices down when a new drug gets invented the FDA gives the company that invented it basically a government mandated monopoly for a small period of time so they can make their money back in without that than there would be no profit so no money would go into developing new drugs and we wouldn't have any new drug so the profits very important\nThe problem that we have though is that monopoly keeps getting extended of they're like well we tweak the formula so we get a new extension where we treat the formulas will give us a new extension well that's obviously just some corporate ...\nWent on and and the drug companies are paying off their buddies into the political process to keep that gravy train going Well Donald Trump says that in his first year they\nAre so much soften the regulations on the requirements for generics that uh the approval process shot through the roof they approved a record number of generics last year there on pace to break that record this year and I can see why the drug prices would go down\nAnother thing he's done to address this the second prong is two bills but they both do the same thing it's sort of like a it's called the patient right to know act one of 'em deals with pharmacies one of them deals with Medicare Medicaid and and government\nInsurance and what happens is if these drug companies give a pharmacy a sweetheart deal on their medication\nThey they are putting gag orders and saying your pharmacist now that we're giving you this discount can't offer other cheaper alternatives\nWell that's illegal now\nAre there was to build it took care of that they've already been signed a past sign and they're about to be an act it soon enough so that's already done this week he announced the third prom and that is on the drug prices initiatives doing something about the disparity in costs between what the drug sales for here in in foreign countries\nWhere taking aim at the global free loading that forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country and I've seen that for years and I never understood\nSame company same box same pill made in the exact same location or you go to some countries and it would be twenty percent the cost of what we pay and in some cases much less than that and I say\nWhy is this I never knew that I Would be able to stand here before you and have a chance to fix it and that's why we're doing we're fixing it\nYeah well I'm I'm a little worried about this one because if they do this wrong this could screw things up the other two problems on the approach I wholeheartedly applaud I just need to see more details but how the Saturday you Gregory is that really a big deal of difference in cost between what we pay hearing in another country\n\nA lot of variables and that between what's here and uh and another country or the rules are different uh home quality of what you get elsewhere and that's even when it's manufactured overseas so\nIt's not quite that simple\nRight and and I I agree there's so many different variables that there is that the question is okay I I Would like to see the disparity come\nBe closed a little bit\nBut the big question is how are you going to do it if you're going to do it by deregulating the\nPharmacy industry here and are lowering barriers to get things to market and making the prices go down in America that way that's cool but if you're going to make a law that forces companies to charge the same thing here that they charge and a third world country well that's not going to work out good for us\nSend him saying does that make sense it at a ... and all I can say is it's very complicated you would want to speed up process uh", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "27"}
