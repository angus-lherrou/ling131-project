{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "In ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin good morning\nOr good morning to both of you on this Thursday or friday as we like to call it\nA couple of really interesting stories that you've got kind of out of the ordinary that we wanted to hear from you on now we've got the story of ... to ... there was a mobile couple that ran into a burning building to help people\nGet their own vacation a on a mission in mission beach in San Diego they were having coffee out by the beach a Tuesday Morning there's people screaming for help\nAnd lo and behold they look or one of the building there it's like a business was downstairs apartment upstairs and it was on fire and um and their names are they are Christine mackerel Haiti and her boyfriend Jared or beak\nAnd without hesitating they ran into that burning up carpet and got people up and out of there there were a couple of injuries but\nBut they say people's lives and they're being hailed as heroes and San Diego on TV and everywhere and uh we talk with folks in San Diego they let a share the story and so there you have is\nPretty impressive that these two ... or so ... and um and they said there was no time to be scared they had to get something done so very proud of them being for immobile in San Diego is now hearing that we've got some really pretty nice people down here on the\nYou know you ... we all have to wonder when we hear the story or how many of us would run into a burning building\n[noise] you know I guess it's just ... ... some people would call for help others are just prone to be more ... more proactive um\nBut they did what they had to do at the moment and I guess you calculate risk as you go a long ride but the important thing is that that ah these people there are a lot of elderly in that apartment complex apparently they may have not very possible\nPossible that they may have not gotten out alive so uh it was smoke inhalation not just flames thanks so we're very proud of them this morning yeah angel there are a couple of other stories that were real quickly touched on this one and and then we can end up behind a mom in mobile\nA is accused of taking her son to a ... plant fight\nOver lap people stadium I guess in the parking lot or something somewhere a and while they were there somebody pulled out a gun and shot mom and sons they're okay you're going to be All right\nBut she's in big trouble because she um she took her son to a to a fight I mean what's the fat that that I mean we've had stories like that before but it's always still hard to imagine that someone would do that her name Danielle Campbell she has a her ... she and her so we're both shot\nAnd now Campbell is charged with inciting riots that's why they\nPlop down on her as far as the charge this morning but it more up lifting story well even uplifting it's just unusual the woman in limestone county in North Alabama uh she walked into her kitchen and found a man making a sandwich\nOkay she didn't know him she did not know him [laughter] and he was in his underwear and she said why are you doing here and he says he's waiting for his close to\nDry grandma but she says it's not as grandson she didn't know who he was he taking a bath brushed his teeth clipped just told him\nOh they'll add up all he called the\nSheriff's department yeah I mean I don't ... their toenail clippers I prefer to have something about I don't know using 'em well cops came and got and they said he appear to be under the influence of some narcotic he was a pilot but they took him away and she says I'm laughing about it now but she says I was scared to death at the time\nOf course we date\nWhat would have happened if he had walked into your ... if you'd walk into your house and so I'm standing there what would happen\nYeah well that's that's the thing not all of us are going to react in a way that this lady did uh he's very he's very fortunate that he didn't pick the wrong house\nThat's what I'm thinking yeah cause Kelly I I don't know would you what would you object Kelly I'm sure I'm just curious\nI don't know what I Would have done and there was a time when I thought I knew how I Would react to these\nShe ... because I have had\nA break in a couple of times at my house and both times the police told me when they came out they think I interrupted a burglary our process and and so that really I was like I really don't tell me that\nSir I don't want to hear that and I I had so much anger over at that I thought I Would react to certain way but then I had a situation where this this gentleman just\nAnd I had taken my kids to to some fast food restaurant and he pushed on my son and just started acting crazy and was verbally abusing me away\nAnd all I wanted to do was get out of there so I really think that when that fight or flight response kicks in I think I have learned I Want to fight in my head but the truth as that flight response is the one I'm going to react to I'm going to get out of dodge\nYou want to live for another day your mom you've got to take your child and I think that's why I get out of the house called the cops with if they know what they're doing a ... I Know some people may say well I'll check that situation and I don't know what that could lead to especially if you have other family members of\nThe house so but apparently she calculated pretty quickly that he wasn't a ... edge apparently there's underwear so are you going to do\nThank goodness it took them get violent [noise]\n... thank you so much for your time that I have a have a great

all around and again\nAnd occasionally my ... is is isn't so soldier so many of them right right exactly yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put 'em in individual cases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards\nAnd it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter right a ... ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist with an e or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever\nInternal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know\nCritics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like porn that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven it was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation um when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been\nOur allies as Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to\nThe FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a friendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point in there and it wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today\nThe difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right and they were never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a bill or at the time you know like\nWhat they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since civil Arlen me there was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand and one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally ... Obama was\nDoing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just that you know the the\nThe overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your bones ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIsn't the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still and I'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them because they just paid us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred\nMillion dollars [laughter] relationship with them it is they send us a lot of\nMoney and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day if of American interests are harmed long term I'm\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority\nTop priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey right like the\nYou know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to talk to some degree anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some\nSlaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia right like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up are working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I\nMean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in the oil that that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well\nI think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your a cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I\nWould think now look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we think we see that\nHappening too infrequently or over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hours dip recruiter or if you go to these

a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by a some Hollywood actresses\nThat there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ET from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself\nObviously and this is the one I'm ... mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and they're not really as herself yes should and poor self out of that situation\nShe's also quite

doing that today the main ... or ... entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from

kill someone if they're sleeping on though [laughter] I mean in my circumstance [noise] that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yeah\nAnd she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pressure lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird

at the Saudi consulate Denise ... boxes Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nThat that's that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't awful roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago and yet\nUh I just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corrupt ration and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThe Brett Kavanaugh stuff has died down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't you're occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story you know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest hate Brett Kavanaugh but\nI mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that\nStory was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nThe Senate and can block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we\nDon't know um but the other people in Cory Booker do not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and he and his ... and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\nLook let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people uh they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident uh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there\nWas no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she wouldn't be back with an avid mountain of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party and I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of slate talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to walk down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the stories you tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her\nFive people said ... five people say Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party and the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after\nIt occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick where they bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader he explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Campbell and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there at work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel\nWindow wow that is ... times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been\nYou should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that is the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard\nThat's been sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there was some ... can show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated\nOr exception of Michael Evan ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my club and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's\nThey say they still believe that show during an October fifth game in Brookhaven which band members pretended to hold police officers at gunpoint was inappropriate becoming less than a week after two officers were shot to death in the city\nBut the resolution asked that the ban be fully reinstated so it could participate and all of its normal activities some local emergency management officials from Mississippi or in Florida now helping with the hurricane recovery Clark counties sci fi is leading it eight member team that's dealt with a lot of other disasters over the years hopefully\nWe're able to help the people with some of our experiences that we've been fortunately had the opportunity to be exposed to\nThe group is working in the hardest hit areas near Panama City dealing with logistics and helping to coordinate donations and volunteers\nOther team members include the emergency management directors from Hancock stone leak in Washington counties and the Mississippi Delta levee board also staff members from Lauderdale in Jackson county's the man who felt it was death that the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula Tuesday night was a contract worker\nAlbert lea bird the second was inside a processing unit when the accident happened Chevron says Byrd's death is being fully investigated yesterday the occupational safety and Health Administration was on the scene\nYou'll have a chance to see some golfers who one major tournaments in Jackson next week the field of a hundred and thirty two players for the Sanderson Farms championship will include two time U.S Open ...

[noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage\nEver ever um well you did things in front of girls right after he asked them if you could yeah and that and they said yes\nAnd are part of this I'll go with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something that against him as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation here he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of like well why is that what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were\nOther comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife\nChild and you should think about that and he said uh I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he learned to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I have issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no data show was shown what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make it if you will he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think\nThat that would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of

there are lots of stories out there about what has happened Mike\nPompeo moments ago talking about the presumed murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he'd jeep people did blackout how healthy you know you're not only he would know that right or maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh\nThere's no way to know that I Am too there's conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nSubtle accusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure as I say I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the spring\nThe court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either and they haven't even I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that and so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens\nWith any big public official or in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWater we and the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the party\nOf the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist his march that women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like you have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that the midst of as occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man maybe if they've assault didn't happened they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhen that accusation should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk about uh yeah I Know\nWe talk about the the women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to\nHow many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy\nWho you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle and receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing the swastikas on their door for nothing you can like say\nWell I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist not one of the entire Supreme Court on the line\nOf course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know\nFor a fact they fit the accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ...\nAnd no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over\nThe store and the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first to and and in the second one is is that there's a ... their right they wouldn't be the person who made the allegation said I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThe failed to act on sounding corroborating evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his are witnesses were saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing it relatively credible job recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false\nIt's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media accent that is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up the high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him take credit didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her L G peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do or ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself a\nOr the woman and why would you do that yeah why it was clear motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in\nTexas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the cam footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing in this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person at a restaurant um who again later on and had to admit that yes he actually wrote the stuff on the receipt\nWow or the former college student who claimed rape and then it had to admit in court that it was completely false on Long Island\nOr a Kansas men who said he\nRacist graffiti on his own car\nOr\nOr or the races note at Saint Olaf college if you remember this one uh that was one where the where they talked
