I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas\nUh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how that turned out the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're sitting with regard to the turnout is a ... records are not just scored mid term elections which is what the stairs up but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nOr the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is is is that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know it was ... but don't mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan is coming up here and we want to make sure we're supposed to be critical to do something to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas\nIt would be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines\nThis election because there are other people out there\nWho are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo I'm covering a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing uh\nA election is it not\nWhile he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under no label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a is an out and now he says he is a socialist and and the Bernie Sanders style of socialism if not even further to the lab and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies\nThat is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into the state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars or directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that ... has funded these ground game stick it out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this uh all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities in blue counties you have\nA Dallas year after year that we have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it so\nMuch harder for people who are conservative people are who are

flowing against peace not true though is it\nHim in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegations that is I don't there was a new allegations of I don't want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was at all in our area of yes yes yeah a little bit or that one or not true is it I mean I don't I as I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every one of which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to have a ... white innocent until proven guilty it's a thing a and I think with ...\nOnly a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about some of these relationships break up and there's\nThings that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing to what they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed cabinet should be you know\nI don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to ... they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\nBut it was fascinating if the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happens latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time and he's\nShe's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt to the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison out in another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into a bright just crazy\nYeah it's an amazing mind so that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four seats are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have to it's forty six excuse me ... if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're a vibrant and then in Texas spill leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than he did a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a him and they could lose it to that could easily still losing possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the program over twenty third this is talk on that program\nAll right what I Would take a break

do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you're putting military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know is it you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and but I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you would have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be hearing you have to chase them around and process in

national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the

care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof just recently not a problem I thought that was okay no I yeah I thought that was fine and with him is

about this before MS Thirteen the United states constantly is is this is just the Donald Trump fever tree it's nothing it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings\nSo if you think MS Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue which I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I like him is hurting the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to

want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome\nThat are not on our borders cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's uh not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end is going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's possible but ... if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border\nThis thing has got to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are are National Guard of the worst people on
