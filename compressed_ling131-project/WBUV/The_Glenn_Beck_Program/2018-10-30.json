V. in Biloxi\nOn news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM that drag immobile\nWill we hear from Darwin not sure [noise]\nDarwin singled out of NBC Fifteen um whether we hear from Darwin or not we do have some things to tell you are that are in the news along the Gulf Coast a couple of city council meetings today\nYeah andme Alexi they're going to meet in special session this afternoon at one thirty and they are considering a multimillion dollar bond issue they say\nIt won't require a hike in taxes and what they want to do is use the money to aid and the funding of a laundry list of projects that range from erecting

coming up at one thirty this afternoon city up Alexi council meeting now Moe bill\nTheir city council meets every Tuesday and they've got\nThis ongoing labor dispute with the public works department the people to pick up the trash there were some people that were fired I Believe last week ... in this labor dispute\nSo the mobile city council they're not getting a lot of answers out of the the the mayor's administration because the mayor's policies that they don't talk about personnel issues\nSo the mobile city council is going to consider appointing\nA special counsel\nTo investigate the conditions in the public works department so that will be I don't know if they'll actually happen today but that is something that will be discussed I'm sure the idea of whether or not they can appoint\nA special counsel to investigate conditions in public works speaking of Darwin singled than we have made contact with Darla is hey\nI'm Sorry we we had a little place activity out and ah so I ran out on that it turned out to be kind of run of the male drug investigation but what what I found when I got out there\nWas extremely thick fog along the Gulf Coast this morning that's very dangerous because the kids were out waiting on buses and and you couldn't hardly see them you could see the buses\nJust letting you know the sporting turn your lights on and go slump the found out\nOkay ... well ... thank you for that update 'em I I notice that you were reporting this morning about how we've got now in in Gulfport there's going to be a prayer service at Jones park at seven o'clock tonight for people to ball faced to show\nA to pray for unity after what happened in Pittsburgh we got something like that happening immobile tonight at six thirty\nAnd this is a chance for me to absolutely mispronounce the name of the synagogue well same here\nI just say it yeah and and and Kelly looked it up front to pronounce your because we're I mean we just got used to saying it it doesn't mean that we're not concerned or we don't appreciate what they're doing they are they going to see a hub Chavez\nOr share synagogue immobile we've heard it's pronounced like three different ways is more right and we pronounce did about probably three or four different ways but the important thing to come out of this\nOr is that there were there's going to be Catholics and Muslims and ... and Presbyterian and all these different denominations immobile have committed their clergy\nAnd some of their uh worshippers have committed\nTo come in here that message of peace and understanding to come together and and say something or make a statement that the the hatred\nA must end toward all people that are different from each other or if we don't know I really don't understand it because this man\nThat killed those living people and wounded several others and we forget to mention them a ... he didn't know any of them had no earthly idea who they were what they stood for ... he didn't break bread with them he didn't spend time with him he didn't know their children\nHe he didn't know the love they had in their heart because his was so full of hate\nAnd I just don't I Can't comprehend that there's got to be some people out there that will be nodding their heads in agreement and other people that will will be clutching their fist and disagreement out there and you know I I Am lost for words when these things happen we had to\nAfrican Americans killed him kroeger\nIn Kentucky just because of of who they were that man came in with a gun after trying to get into a church and and and just shut them down for no reason and now you have families grieving and asking why and there is no why [noise]\nIt's just it just got to end and you know we are each independently I'm On

in our country that's not who we are I I don't know I don't know I I'm I'm I'm not lost for words I'm seldom last storage and if we get to that point you know that it's over but um\nI just wish I could say that magic thing that would make people straight nothing and consider their fellow man and I don't know what those words are and it just I Want to say I am and I can't find them it's just so frustrating\nIt is but it is encouraging here's we run out of time it encourages me to see that so many different faiths are getting involved in this at the mobile effort all these different faiths

President Trump wants to undo a policy that critics have said attract what's called birth tourism boxes John decker lab at the White House\nWhat what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one\nThere will be an invasion\nBecause America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you\nCan expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here\nAnd you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWould you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what they're not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I shouldn't be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country needs either\nSerious policy on the border that will stop this\nOr you need to build the damn wall because quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program direction by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers hello stew\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get balls you with the chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category you have 'em because Poland's been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nAh and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota there's going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really moved them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was more some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling is a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat the polling there you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or with the tops of race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around you know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big hope for pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kavanaugh vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nurses were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the ... category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house\nTerms that lecture and by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr want to tell you about our response to this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service\nI I'm going to be honest with you I have I've I'm I'm I'm fifty\nThree fifty

podcast that you can listen to and download\nAt your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem\nWell problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is a justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged parts and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a ... and\nIt's just to reiterate using or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah you're gee you literally\nDemocrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and having a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous that what that was ... and so it's what I meant interpreted now all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no\nBut if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court I kind of okay with that\nYeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because of they will challenge\nIt they will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we praise from about\nRelatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to\nBe fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck\nSchumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally is I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and if you say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even debt but we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's gotta be a part of it that just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what she had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a point to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message\nBy time and time again tweeting about baseball we're\nTalking about is bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] send a message to white nationalist says about me that much but I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nI'm just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a hard core conservative yeah chilled our daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not\nI mean not at least not at that desk sent a good friend and a good friend in me could good friends all go read good good good good buddy they watched a lot of the debates together you know good friends only mean\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nHe was going to get right not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitcoin crypto currency and blocked Jane that is the future and you need to understand it take this Glenn Beck exclusive\nCourse right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven P.

radios [noise]\nKids are born in America shouldn't be Americans I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country illegally are not as a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nLook at look at look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite\nThat's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is is a homo phobic\nAnd it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so at my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nUh you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late last waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided only tell one side of the story\nSo that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing moment to\nCall out a man that is getting in bed with other people\nKids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by\nSo few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and\nOne way and then on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think of them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of a very unhealthy\nCommunity that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years\nStart to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives where we need to start creating content for ourselves\nAnd we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red told America that's on the heart radio a pod cast a shooting I heart radio excuse me I heart radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nThe Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network\nShe was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her and so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized\nThat the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy\nDo you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in the entire me too movement at a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it it basically she was you know print brave and doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might've been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was\nA God given birth to a man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened\nAnd egg and Patrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ...

within Islam and throughout the correct and there is the doctrine of deception Muslims are forbidden from mixing with people of other faiths but they must do that\nBecause sometimes they have to convert and spread Islam\nHence the doctrine of deception where lying is encouraged the purpose of lying is to smooth over the differences or gain the upper hand over an enemy I'm quoting and to

supposed to be the check on the press sort of this is\nThe key message in President Trump's mid term playbook hate the media fear the migrants caravan save me from a democratic oversight\nHe's trying to stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing the fake news while newsrooms or on a heightened state of security alert\nDidn't seem to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack that means\nHe's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the

embolden the border\nWe did say that he and you should understand that your words matter every single one of them but so far you don't seem to get that\nBloomberg Trump is inciting people the

gas GOP leaders are all talking about an imminent invasion even though no such thing is happening\nOn Fox I counted more than six the invasion invasion references since October sixteenth invading was brought up more than a dozen times on Fox Business I counted more than Seventy five invasion references mostly on Lou Dobbs show by the way this data includes repeats\nBut now Trump is using the word the president apparently is in second guessing himself on Monday he used the word invasion for the first time in a tweet\nBut many Americans perhaps most\nAre looking at Trump's decision to send fifty two hundred troops to the border as a stunt or political theater on MSNBC is all in Michelle Goldberg she said quote Trump is not only created this big lie about this caravan that has inspired mass murder\nBut he's now shifting the resources of government to substantiate his lie\nAt the same time on Fox Tucker Carlson review or wrists reassured his views are viewers that migrating caravan is a real thing but what do you do with the invaders\nOliver Darcy emails I think the natural question to ask is what to do with invaders this rhetoric from Fox is particularly charge because a flooded tells the Fox audience one doesn't lead invaders into their home\nWhen faced with the invaders one generally uses everything at their disposal to confront them including force and that's the message that Fox is relaying to millions of people and quote\nShip speaks the proof\nThere is no invasion no one is coming to get you ship Smith said on Monday there is nothing at all to worry\nState troopers
