how are you\nI'm doing well how are you guys now I I I'm great but I don't understand how you have the work ethic clay\nTo do radio TV you got the website and now you've written a book like\nI'm not sucking up because we were buddy we we go way back like how do you find time for this when you got a wife and I what three kids yeah\nThree young boys who are downstairs right now playing a a oh what's the to the game of not be nicer yeah you're right I Am a hundred percent they play Fortnite Madden or their two favorite things to play in life so uh look I\nI I don't know a is an easy answer it's funny I asked one of our buddies who who's a producer at a at a fast one\nUh I asked ... first feedback on the er the first couple of weeks of the new TV show and he said man I thought you were really good but he was like on Thursday and friday I just thought you worked really really tired and like I don't have a makeup person here obviously I I Do the show from uh from my house they got a camera in my house\nAnd I was like do that because I Am really really tired and you know um I I think it's just it it's just something where somebody said something I'm a to me a while back and they said you know you can always do a little bit more\nAnd ah what I tried to do is balance things I Know we've talked about this quite a bit I spend ... ... what I have found in the ... that I have been doing the TV show is I spent much less time on social media now yeah and uh and and you know try to use\nSocial media and I had a conversation with Cal heard about this and it was a good one you know at this point I feel like I have five hours of daily television I have Fifteen hours of weekly radio I Do a periscope and Facebook and I write\nMy opinions are well distributed right and at this point what I Need is just to use social media primarily as a megaphone\nNot as a microphone you know and what I mean by that is responding to individual people and reading your mentions like it can be addictive but it's not necessarily an efficient use of time so that's one place where I've managed to create a little bit of time the biggest issue is just honestly how early my date start\nAnd how late it finishes now when it's you know Monday Night football but I Need to watch and talk about our Sunday Night Football I I definitely don't root for overtime\n[laughter] we're talking with clay Travis\nOut kick the coverage host on Fox Sports radio Monday to friday yeah clay I totally agree the days of arguing with egg avatars are totally over you're right you know your popping you drop a little nuclear bomb on social media and then you get out and let those guys\nLet them go nuts on it or I Want to quickly pivot to your Tennessee Titans are two huge wins in a row you're a season ticket holder\nClay I got to say this feels like a dangerous spot for them going on the road to face you know arguably the worst team in the league and we know Josh Allen is kind of a joke at quarterback\nYeah look I mean the line actually has you know sometimes I like to watch the money come in and it makes me feel a little bit better I think the line has moved to all the way up to five and a half or six the titans as a road favorite against the bills here's what I Would say about the titans right now\nMike VR able I Would take a bullet for if I was like in the secret service that's how good he has been through four weeks and I've said before and like I ... about the teams that I root for\nIn the last Twenty years the only other coach that I felt like that early about was Bruce Pearl upper Tennessee basketball and I still love Bruce Pearl Auburn men's basketball coach now I Would dive in front and have taken a bullet for him because almost immediately you could see him changing the culture\nAnd changing the expectations and in week to Mike variable beat the Houston Texans with ... quarterback with Derrick Henry taking snaps in the wild cat without his top three tackles left tackle and right tackle out and the top a top or a backup was in the hospital\nSo they signed somebody on the practice squad to go up against that Houston Texans defense the fence it front that week and they won that game and when I left the stadium that day I said I don't remember the last time I have seen a better game plan it might not have gone well they scored on a a fake paws\nThey manufacture twenty points as best they could it might not have gone perfectly but it was a game plan that you knew had been adjusted on the fly to put them into a position to win a game and it's been so long since I've seen that from an NFL coach for my team\nThat I was all in all I think there'll be the bills I think there'll be four in the wind and start to get a lot of attention because the ravens will be coming to town\nAnd then right after that couple of games to pay attention to I think I've got this right or we I Know the next game is in London and I'm taking the boys in my family and ... and work out yeah we're going to London a yeah I'm excited about that even in the middle of football season I didn't know I had\nThe TV show when I when I set up this play out I Love I Love London and uh I don't know about you but\nOne of the things that I think about a lot now with the kids being young is\nI Want to do things with them while they still like us you know I've got a fifth grader a second grader and a four year old and they love being around mom and dad right now they think we're the greatest thing ever\nWhen you get to that Thirteen fourteen your age ... seventh eighth grade will be the worst human beings on Earth Day won't want to be around ... there'll be Bradley there'll be going through adolescence eventually they will merge on the other side like we all do\nBut while they're still fall and and yelling and everything else I like to get them out on the road and take trips with him wow do that\nGame in London and then the titans have a week off and then I Believe the next game or to the game after that next one is a Monday Night game against the the the Dallas Cowboys to me that is when the titans are going to kind of sweep onto the national stage\nAnd we'll see whether or not they're ready for their close up whether they are a legitimate contender to win the AFC South\nAnd you know do what they did last year when a playoff game and kind of advances of the playoffs or whether it's still a little bit early and some of the deficiencies on ah on defense maybe we'll start to reveal themselves and uh and we'll see what happens but I look I think ...\nThrough four weeks of the season they have looked to every bit of a playoff team that can win a game and the playoffs in the NFL\nClay Travis hosted out kicked the coverage he's got a new book out he is on lock it in on the F ... one daily clay give let me get you out of here with a college football to give me a winner of blood bank guaranteed today yeah I'll tell\nYou by the way I Want to thank you for coming on the television show for people who haven't watched it you've been phenomenal on it as a weekly gas lock it in for thirty eastern one thirty Pacific set the DVR we got to do a couple of prime time shows on Thursday and friday of this week after major league baseball playoffs\nAre the book is out Republicans buy sneakers too it's a good read I think it's smart read I think people will enjoy it\nUm but uh best when tapping the vein right here for you Jay back ah we are the shadow of a doubt I did my favorite bet so foreign college football this season and I am on this for an embarrassing amount of money All right so if I lose a everybody else is losing on this too I Love the under\nI'm personally that's got a daughter and but I shared it with somebody may as well as the organization and everyone else in Boston you guys will have me back I went on resigning here next year\nWhat what's the point is that why you nothing on the pre season now a couple of quick things on it yet Kyrie Irving\nOr maybe it was like four months ago said yeah I'm not signing the extension it would be who've me financially to sign the extension\nUnderstandable we get that so why would I read do this on the cusp of the pre season I Want to ... ... just to recap I land on resigning if you'll have me\nPlan on that's not a guarantee we know how sports where things change you know when you go out when you go on social media and then you'll say with Jason you said Kyrie a Jimmy ... there's going to be in play\nYeah that was before Jimmy Butler demanded a trade that's now changed the calculus of it do you see the timeline\nJimmy Butler demands a trade\nA week later Kyrie Irving I plan on resigning in Boston okay let me recap ...\nFour months ago Kyrie Irving well I I Will see what happens I'm going to be a free I'm going to you know opt out as everybody knows that well\nJimmy Butler I Want out of here a week goes by covering up staying in Boston like adding up people\nRead between the lines Jimmy Butler says he wants out a week goes by he adds an idea of what's going to go down and I can tell you behind the scenes it's looking a lot right now like the clippers right now things change\nBut I Will tell you that when Jimmy Butler said you go to the clippers Kyrie Irving he ain't going to the clippers\nKyrie Irving has his sights set on Brooklyn New York but he had planned on talking with Jimmy Butler and I and I would definitely say Brooklyn over New York for sure we all know Kyrie Irving from New Jersey closed with his father Family Guy blah blah blah\nJimmy Butler was thinking New York or Brooklyn now it's looking like Jimmy Butler clippers so as these things go on behind the scenes things change Kyrie Irving well not as attractive if I Can't team up with my buddy I go into Brooklyn solo\nAnd oh yeah yeah the Celtics have one of the best teams in the leak it'll be a major upset at the Celtics don't make the final\nI think the Celtics could push the warriors they got a great coach they got a great defensive team\nI think the Celtics or Seventy when ... you don't leave a Seventy when team yes let the record show Kyrie Irving did leave liberal on okay\nHe did leave Lubrano remember have you ever won the title than what changed Kevin Durant goes to the ... their orderly dominant they smoke\nHigh re in the Bronx cats I received oh\nWait a second\nUh LeBron's going to leave next summer will get me the hell out of here so I'm just telling you these things are constantly fluid I Know that you you guys don't want to hear that because weight but you said this things change if you're gonna be hung up on what I said six months ago about a prediction\nLike be consistent\nI told you guys get on board that LeBron train you said not the west and stuff you didn't want to get on board okay well things have changed their Marlboros and gets traded a chooses first go why letter does you know to Toronto it the NBA is just so crazy and hectic I'm just going to say this\nIf the Celtics don't get out of the east I think ... but I Do think they get out of the ... and I think the odds are Kyrie Irving probably states are coming up next year on the big lead Fox Sports radio\nDoes it I Know he's only a rookie but did you hear Baker may feel take a shot at hue Jackson oh my\n[noise]\nIf you suffer from E.
