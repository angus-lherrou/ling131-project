before we went live to hurt Kelly said end in the ... the storm in the path or should make landfall\nSomewhere around port saint Joe [noise] I Know she's\nBeen talking to her parents are in the last day or two and her dad was getting ready to evacuate or he did yesterday her mom is flying in somewhere in the tree but can't get back now so I'm\n... ... it's it she said I I as I as I toss the story to her so she could report I mentioned that and you could see her kind of catch her breath because she'd been thinking about it\nAnd all of us kind of caught ours because a suddenly it really hit home to us a port saint Joe is a small town and she went on to say at that moment that she graduated with Ninety kids in her graduating class that's how small it is and uh\n[noise] if you stop lights up in a in a couple of gas stations are but if this storm land serves a category three\nWhen Megan gets back to her hometown or it's going to be completely different and it it all of a sudden you know it's funny how you report these things but then suddenly something happens and they hit home that kind of hit home for all of us because we could see the look on her face about how suddenly a she had to\nTo try to step back in her reporter mode and ah continue on reporting from Pensacola so uh\nYou know even though we're kind of far from the epicenter of the story it's just good every now and then to realize there's real people in the path of these things we felt it before and and so we know what they're feeling today\nAbsolutely and we're we're we're far from the epicenter as you said but we're still we're just right outside of the cone\nWe are we're going to see in fact I'm and all the way over to Mississippi I think you guys might be under a a tropical storm watch or something or some kind of like insurance just in case it kind of\nYou know trends over a little bit to the to the west are we are under the southern part of our county ... county here in Alabama we are under a\nA hurricane watch all of us are under a tropical storm warning over here and then it just gets worse and worse as you go toward Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach\nBut we're going to feel the effects stop an island already having some flooding just because of high tides and and the ah you know the push the water from the storm but we're going to feel some effects today\nIf we get some rain that will actually help us I don't know how much we we might get but I think um\nYeah we we could get some wind out of this and uh it's not going to be anything like they're going to experience all further to the to the east\nYeah another thing that uncle Henry and I have been discussing is\nThe exit path as Michael because as it makes its way out of the u._s. it's expected to hit the Carolinas and they're

talking blue tarps I Know what you're saying oh there's a lot of\nThere's they think they they are experienced the worst but now comes a I guess just the insult to injury and ah they I Would think\nIt I Would think that any structure that's going to be flooded already flooded but you're right there's there's wind damage and there's trees that have fallen there's groups that are damaged homes are still possibly livable well\nNow they have to I'm sure they'll be scurrying to put buckets out and this and that try to try to just to keep a their households together those people\nWell who been crippled by the storm um ... yeah it's it's so unfortunate as going in that direction\nA but but it is you're right and I and we will be feeling for them because you know I I see still see blue tarps or from the last storm that we had here years ago I still see some of them around town I guess people just couldn't afford to put new roof sought so um they're dealing with it and I imagine it's going

opposition are the people leading the leadership the Democrat Party\nI Will have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there I Would have party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and it being manipulated and it's a huge chunk\nOf the American population being being a poll or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts are that\nAre I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and peculiar people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if they see our people on the rights punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side\nBeing unreasonable violence if you see\nAnti FAA the way to answer ... is ...\nNot with uh the militant people it will come out the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be

it's awesome\nAnd I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with every I bet you've said that we need to at least a conversation about\n... because of it and I you know I\nThink we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering heavy I I think that there really is ... fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's what it is something that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right number ... ... where ... you know the ...\nThey were afraid that technology was going to come and ... they're probably correct and so um\nI understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachines and keep running you know there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go into ... and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and ice that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just a ... there's ... it don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ah what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than they work unless I'm so I'm coming just for a different perspective having and that that it research that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they able to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nSo Heather or there was a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true age GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal\nThan anyone else the bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nUh the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nAnd be a cat three at landfall near Panama City tomorrow could be packing a hundred
