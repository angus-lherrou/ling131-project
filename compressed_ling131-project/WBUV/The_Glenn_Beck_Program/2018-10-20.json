brought with him Kevin Love\nOkay they had a whole mess of new players oh look they started one in three\nAnd then they started five and seven the\nCleveland Cavaliers on LeBron second tour of duty started nine teen and twenty\nThat's almost half the season they lost six straight at one point and yes\nA LeBron had been injured I think he missed about seven or eight games\nBut come January late January early February the cabs P lost twelve straight so using history is our guide whatever happens in these first eleven game to the Lakers and it's again to repeat it's a brutal stretch just starts disease eight of their first eleven\nOr against playoff teams from last year and a nice game is against Denver who is probably a playoff team this year\nAnd they got eliminated on the final night of the season last year so there's going to be a chance that the Lakers start out some things like\nI don't know get an I mean could they start out four and seven ... wouldn't shock you if the Lakers started five and six or four and seven not at all I I Wonder given what if the Lakers came out of the shoe would that brutal schedule and all the new pieces three and eight\nYeah that wouldn't shocks me to oh I see more shocking if they had a winning record I Would see now I Would agree with that were sensible we're not the masses out here in LA and all the bronco fans and the LeBron haters were going to be so grateful if he struggles\nThe gate and I'm telling you folks do you remember who was the blame guy in Miami it was Chris Bosh it was Eric ... initially\nAnd then he got to Cleveland again and Kevin Love was blamed and David black was blamed David blight was eventually fired now I don't want to get ahead of myself but if\nThings don't go well out of the gate Gavin says he's not going to be surprised if it's three and eight or ... or in seven I'm telling you that you guys that they're going to be finger pointing at our Luke Walton\nAnd brand and it and I and I like renting them a lot and I know Luke Walton is tight with Jeanie Buss I like Luke Walton a lot I mean I thought he over achieve last year was ... when it thirty five games with that young team\nI Would keep an eye on Brandon ... he's the guy who was supposed to make the leap last year and he kind of did but he got hurt\nBut I Wonder ... number in Cleveland LeBron orchestrated a mid season trade it when he returned to get a bunch of new guys like JR summit like mobs Gulf ... jumper it worked\nRemember last year in Cleveland midway through the season they're struggling what do you do you have got half the roster okay we see Jimmy Butler out there demanding a trade I I'm not saying the Lakers are pulling the trigger I like to be a guy who's out of the curve I like to see potential wrote bumps\nOr potential storyline I I'm just telling you I like Brandon Ingram he's only Twenty one I'm not selling Brennan England\nBut I'm going to ask you what does he do great he's not a great shooter thirty nine percent from deep last year not either good pass\nOr not great good passer but he's not going to be passing when you've got Ron do and you got LeBron and Lorenzo bowls passing the second unit\nSo I'm not saying bringing them does nothing great 'cause he's very good at everything\nBut is he a guy that's going to be a deciding vote in a big trade now against salaries come into play I'm just saying don't panic if the Lakers start early but I guarantee you and and ... going to charge this we are October twenty of\nEarly in the show keep an eye on if the Lakers struggle out of the gate and a little brown always figure that out I'm not worried I still believe this will be the second best team in the west but just like moving\nIt takes some time the process takes not days not weeks it takes months so my gauge on this team I Will enjoy this sort of the season I Will be in the building tonight against Houston but\nI Would say thanks giving is the first okay it's time to take a real deep look at the Lakers and then Christmas will be game on\nLeBron what are we got so uh it's good to have the NBA back I Love the NFL's late this weekend again my picks are coming up at forty five

I'm an African civilized state questions unfortunately the last guy so he's all excited the red Sox are going to the world\nSeries a Albert beer from Monday morning quarterback Albert what's up man I'm doing good how are you doing Jay\n... I'm All right you know Albert are just so many places we could START I I I Want to start with your Ohio State buckeyes and Nick boasts a real quick sure and I'm going to talk about this later in the show but\nI I did not understand the negativity toward both are for deciding to drop out of school and focus on the NFL Draft do people understand that like twenty million dollars or more is at stake here like I said\nI think that's\nWhy I see now here's the thing I made the mistake of watching some TV shows on our rival network and a lot of the former athletes are like well he quit on his team\nYeah I mean I like look you know I I I think that's the case I mean there are not very many close is out there where you know I'm going to be a top five pick\n'em and they have an injury that really I mean I I I'll pick is he's nothing but damn close to being season that day and then they've got to make a rational business decisions and you know I think this is a good development for athletes um two sizes of course I didn't watch as a good development for athletes\nIt's the next step um you know what Christian McCaffrey and then let her for that to a couple of years ago when they get the ball games any more guys who like last year or you know I think guys who are in their final year of college that those are going to be you know hyper shrimp pick\n'em suffer something nagging and then they're going to have to make a judgment call what they're going to do and if you don't think that there are other guys out there that thought about this week and they saw what he said I you know I ... and there are guys who are going to be high draft picks that that that that that have dealt with injuries this fall\nJurors Shon Gary Michigan for example he's dealing with them when they see joined injury\nOr do you think about it now you know if you're Bryce Stanford do you think about it shows\nI think it opens the door for that sort of train of thought and there's not a daunting prospect of being the first one to do of course that's one side of it I think everybody certainly understands what they post is doing he had to make a business decision like you said at the twenty five to thirty million dollar decision\nAnd there's no question that there is very very saw logic behind what he was doing\nAnd the other side of it of course came captain and bet you leaving school you know it's not like he's going to be around the program a day to day basis now he's withdrawing from school and so\nUm yeah I can I can understand that side of it too you know that there's you know a commitment you have your team and everything else but I mean look bad you know I I think you and I've been around this fall and now we both though\nYou know how quickly these things can come to an end for athletes how fragile all of it is and so I you know I I don't know how anybody could look at the position I think poses in ... and not come to the conclusion that there's a lot of logic behind the decision to start\nWith Albert rear Monday morning quarterback guy he's the man dude everybody knows album re around the league\nAlbert uh let me just ping pong some uh some names off you in the NFL real quick levy on bell what is the latest you or does he want to get back to Pittsburgh everybody assumed oh yeah my week you've got two weeks you get acclimated and what's the latest\nAnd the Steelers don't know I'm kind of interesting\nForm about this and I mean I I think that that's really where things are broken down over the last two of us has all been about communication I mean you never won a from a foster and Markey's pounds see a\nVillain wave a you know kind of call them out there yeah I'm first week of September I did that was because they were told that he was coming back on Labor Day\nHe didn't show up and then they tried to reach out to him and he didn't get back to that you know so they were best at like just the lack of communication there um he hasn't been communicated with the with the front office with the coaches\nAnd so they really at this point don't really know uh whether or not he's going to Sean fun on day\nUm and then of course it was a question of what this is going to look like going forward I just show me who's going to show up um you know time to get the six games um and that means he's going to have to show up pretty soon they don't need to count your towards free agency and and actually make it to the market and march\nUm you know the question then becomes you know what you're going to look like what kind of shape CNN how's it going to see them as he often see up shut here for levy on\nAnd I look I don't I wouldn't have thrown away the mind that he did I mean most fighters wasn't throw away the money that he did and I think ultimately could wind up looking pretty bad for having done that the one positive here on his on his James Caan or has has has emerged as a legitimate options the Steelers and the backfield\nAnd so now when it comes back\nMaybe they won't just pound them into the ground that they would have ... in a way they may have otherwise maybe now he comes in and it's a little bit more of a good situation so you know he\nKeeps coming that mileage off his body going forward but certainly a weird situation and again the field I don't really know um whether or not he's going to walk to the door on Monday or Tuesday or once\nA we're talking with Albert freer Monday morning quarterback Albert\nUh or the cold still the team that makes the most sense for a lot of young\nI don't think the cold to do it I I really I'd be right based on what I Know I don't do it um you know I just I I I Know how to value their topics you know I Know what are the rap from\nA building standpoint and there I mean as bad as it's ... points this year they are really nice draft they didn't have their eyes are headed in the right direction they got the building blocks to but you know guys like Clinton Nelson and\nThe mines and Jordan Wilkins and of course there is one or two\nBefore he got hurt was on track to potentially be as offensive rookie leader now of course about building something there and I think ... better on a weekly basis like I think he's going to get back there\nUm I don't think that there are potential any spot for ... in fact\nYou know the one logical one that came up if this was going to be that\nYou know do you not say my New York jets\nIs not the jets I I Would be out and it's a I Would be out of course if the judge traders working okay I don't think that that's going to trade on the one logical landing spot will do the Tampa Bay buccaneers and the reason why the reason why\nIs because they've got a coach and the general manager who are fighting for their jobs now who can't afford to what sport at twenty nights you know twenty twenty value dropped it's the same way\nUm and they've gotten often is already I'm already very very talented ah forget the quarterback I mean just look around like Evans shock Jackson because God when OJ Howard yeah let me on bell to that next you're talking about golf and says I mean from a town standpoint overwhelming\nNow I have to understand\nBut yeah but Tampa is the one that alive teams like and you know I've heard the jets and I've heard of the cold and\nI you know I should tell you from I my understanding is I don't those teams would really be in is um the buccaneers is our team that a lot of other teams just on a two and the other one is sort of on the periphery will be Green Bay although I I just just knowing what they've been over the years\nUm they would have to go outside of you know what's been there a ... a historic do have a new GM they have to go outside with her I'm always been historically to do it\nWow album for your big when I let me get you out of here on this\nAlbert I'm irrationally in love with the bears plus three against the patriots [laughter] on Sunday the fan geo who was in Baltimore the defensive coordinator of the ... he he he knows that the animal one time you got you got to pressure and the bears can deliver pressure was ... Mac\nOr you want to talk me out of this or a you know you're far I'm\nWorried I just tell you I think max can apply or like everybody else\nLike I just I Know I Know a pass Russia looked like when they fight back up and that doesn't mean like ... not going to give a hundred percent or effort or anything like that but you know this ankle injury robs them of explosive so things are back to fight with those positions\nThat was that that was that moment so uh we'll we'll we'll get to that later in the show what does it mean when Geico says just Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance means you probably should have gone to Geico dot com\nIf teen minutes ago uh before I get to the smartest thing I saw this week let me quickly ask a my guys you're Gavin and Sam are you guys going out for Halloween\nDo any parties and what are you being I still undecided on the costume but I Do know where I Will be okay Sam do you have a costume\nOr I Do not I may have to work in some capacity so uh we'll leave it all in the open up and down here right near do ah we just got invited some Halloween party dress up deal\nAnd I'm sitting there talking to the wife I'm like oh jeeze I haven't dressed up in a couple of years you know it's like I Would remember how the cobra guys were skeletons are in karate kid I found that outfit that costume on line and I was that one like maybe three or four years ago it was fun um\nBut that out the costume was it was a little bit tight so my wife's going through ideas and we came up with guy says it's really embarrassing\nUm we're going to do the jazz men and a lot in deal so she's going to be Jasmine obviously and this so funny but the people who invited to party go ... gotta wear something to show off his arm and I was like\nWhy why even saying that they're going to find a deal so ah you know if you follow me on Instagram you've probably seen some lame workout videos that have posted a man it's fun whatever um so I\nGoing to be a lot and a lot and you even lift bro you to [laughter] have you got you got a buddy of mine baby come on them you know that anyway let me get to ... you don't care about my Halloween and got big arms to Nick both as giant norm is arms\nAre folks ...
