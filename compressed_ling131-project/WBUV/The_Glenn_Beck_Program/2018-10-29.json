cable news never my for the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN can't watch it because I don't know who's doing

I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does 'cause that's\nOn watch all the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on a sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would have been to them talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... from salt like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of hers but he's like you know\nHe didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt them in anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what\nWhat what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah with a lot like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that\nWere telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the republic and was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they had a very balanced view of that one\nFor a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nIn fact repeat it ah it consistently gets repeated and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so

I think it Sunday yeah it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the ticket and the details on we're going to be ...\nIt's going to be fun there's a lot of elections stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff you were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nYes that it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you we're going to have lapse in in comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the uh proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give him too yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish\nUm center perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure but not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth to get a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros she meadow\nA and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted\nHere's an example of supporting the Jewish people\nAnd posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nOr as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was I thought that's really national award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just\nIt was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that I got a big one so it's just amazing\nYou know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and\nThe people in this audience I Would sleep all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him more rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\n... around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because you have written weight Shapiro deporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew\nOh but because he came up with the idea of communism I\nI'm not a bad no not a fad and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Bennett Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really\nNot understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not they all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right\nHere's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic what it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas or they rape\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe it's about ... ... trying to make these into cartoon arguments which is such a a ...\nI Can't just be another sample of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway because they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow

suspicious package I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta addressed to CNN\nThis is the man accused in fourteen other pipe bomb mailings goes to court today in Miami where Fox's Evan brown is live\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they could have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that in people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and six team so two thousand twelve on average squirting FiveThirtyEight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nUh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate didn't\nTwo dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now they were Twenty one districts that voted for Iraq Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but it's big it's a big change so and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting and roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Iraq Obama\nWhen Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama than change to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five pointed vantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats at least you know now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWhere this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have been just a big lead\nOr not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers ... tell me what all this means\nFrom last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum started just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now it seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will\nWe see any movement at all are due to the shooting and the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that at
