he sounds a little nasally this morning apparently I'm a little more polite then you Darwin\nOh no this is a polite is concerned it [laughter] it's not it's not being impolite it's oh showing my concern for uncle Henry Hill\nOh OK darn it already Darwin is now the door when is the\nKind of guy that if you have spinach in your teeth he is going to be the first one there to say hey yeah you and your tape you got some black on your job [laughter] yeah yeah\nAnd that guy yeah you you don't want somebody okay now look if I have some things are all my tulips are hanging from my nose or something not somebody to tell me what am I if I got a big lockout hair sticking\nStraight up on the air and the and the ... the producer in the booth does it say hey doormen put down the both of those hairs

meant\nTo lend me your advice to Darwin to uncle Henry about as cold since you're so concerned about is help\n\nUh don't give it to anyone else oh okay All right [laughter]\nDarwin St Darwin cares

just adopted a couple of dogs now I'm I'm In my second lead allergy at well I I think it's a cold and I'm I'm at a point where I'm comfortable with the cold because I'm worried about what my house is going to smell like wants to this\nCold winters up [laughter]\nOh now you're they're not they're not going in your house\nAnymore not anymore we're not only more solve that situation have before we run out of time here we would we do have a new story that we can get to\nA and it's a story that I saw on NBC fifth day and it's about how\nAlabama now oh one of the ... that has online sales tax collected Mississippi already got into this ... in Alabama started doing it yesterday now Darwin did you pay attention\nTo Rachel Wilkerson story on NBC Fifteen about this because she interviewed a lady that said that it's it was described as a hobby and one woman said that she ordered stuff so frequently she forgets what's\nComing to her house and it's like it's all\nReally it is and there was another gentleman that says I just enjoy driving home and there's something from target or Amazon sitting on much to\nEdit it gets excited about it uh I I guess it helps if you can forget what you did so then you're constantly being surprised but that's life isn't it [noise] but ... but it's going to cost us now a sales tax uh eight percent I Believe on things that you buy a line in Alabama now the sales tax\nImmobile when you figure all local into it's about ten percent so you can save two percent by doing it online or but I'm told people really are they don't really care if they have to pay a little bit of sales tax unless it's a big ticket item they'll just keep ordering anyway\nYeah where are we ... we now gotten to that point I I think a few years ago maybe ten years ago of online sales tax would upset some people but now we're so used to buying things online yeah this is just not a bad deal\nWill hopefully it'll bring in enough money to ah to mobile that to its let's we do get some of that money that we can keep our historic one\nMark's open [noise] but Kelly do you buy stuff on line\nI'm not really a big on line person I'm a little old school when it comes to items I purchased I'd like to see them and feel them and yes damage them at the melody how they work in that kind of thing so\nIt yeah yeah I agree a hundred percent I think people you know it it depends I guess on the company you order from um\nSo you know it it it has but I'd like immediate gratification I like to go and get it in the store I I Walk around to the store look at everything to see if I'm getting the right thing or the best deal uh-huh\nUh and I just I Love the way Christmas shopping I Will it out and get a very southern border saying so I just like to\nTouch them feel like you said and figure out this is what it was yeah [noise] so now we pay more for that two percent or then I Would on line but I don't mind that so uh what was the lesson you bought on line a co Henry did you buy anything online recently\nI think it was I think it was dog food\nTonight I revealed her eyes are\nYeah by the way our heart radio does pay me enough that I wasn't for me\nIt was for the dog [laughter]\nYour

I Do have the uh the temperament to be on the ... the a team however\nAll you know ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent on fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how he look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture up this man he was in his anger\nWhen he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing anything so if I never met anyone reached further\nI Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like\nThe anger I Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful unless\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here is my ... to Donald Trump first of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it no other president in my lifetime would have\nStuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWearing this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do knocked move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said\nAnd I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turned out to be right you notice you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony they're no longer on that yeah nobody in like she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose\nShe bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and there's FBI they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions\nOf ah ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighth he was the vote went down so let it for weeks three four weeks for an hour we could probably go to a fast rate other things going on um\nCase so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the ... the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's the only out of there get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list yes so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him\nLet's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow [laughter] which I wouldn't\nStrange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy with their fighting on the ... yeah I was trying to run if\nThat happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering ah [noise] the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ... uh\nYou need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution anything I mean he will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nWas in Johnson City Tennessee last I campaigning for Republican Senate candidate in talking about his Supreme Court nominee and you'll be doing the same thing tonight in Mississippi Trump is

the good\n\nI feel bad for this woman I really do\n\nShe goes on these rats quite often by the way\n\nShe doesn't like Brett Kavanaugh she doesn't like President Trump the reason why I bring her up is well a Twitter are you going to kick her off are you going to kick her off\nIf this isn't if this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is what she really typified the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left\nNo amount of evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really I can understand\nHow you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there is nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yeah no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that\nYou cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me\nJudge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a

guilty\n\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men uh it had been one was a alleged land or the other was it clear racist gundy\nI still think they were great men they were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collect the justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad and I am\nWarning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road\nYou always always end up killing people\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge

change the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time\nThe media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these are the years you're flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way\nAnd as I have said on many occasions on this program since the election\nI was wrong on multiple occasions but what amazes me\nIs when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it that's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you\nThat's foolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others\nPlease don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least make in some sense please do not rubbed their oh well we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that\nWill come them if we're going to heal the nation the first thing we have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation we have got to put our differences aside and begin to open up

B. U. V. [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] I Would love to talk to you and maybe we'll do this on Thursday um anybody who has read the book and wants to ah talk about it I Would love to talk to you about it\nAnd hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood um you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good\nIf you've read the book addicted outrage and we put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from me Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it yeah which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after it came I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in there\nWell I I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with Kevin ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this cabinet yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not ... not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism uh it's explained in the book and you'll see a lot of times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just doesn't make any sense and there's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean and it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example of them\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah or you can find it in the book addicted to outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh end of the\nThe the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe what they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy in the patriarchy and to collapse\nThe system that we have yeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life hooked us up to ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading it tried to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do 'em and uh and then joined us on a joined us on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've dealt with the the Kavanaugh scenario uh\nAnd it is that we are in an interesting place it's going to come down to

All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you stop at the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nGeneral general attorney general ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been at a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case in the case\nOf the cabinet case happens uh thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even than that there was a relationship of any sort between Oregon Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused\nHim of sexual abuse or and\nIt's a cool violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little did a she remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases yeah the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do\nName Keith Ellison as the reason why she getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and\nThis is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll abusing meeting\nMe yeah and she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident [noise] um and it has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness wishing we need to deal with them of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key those in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures and there are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was ... now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nOf course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the bail us with a friend\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know\nHundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alison case do", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "02"}
