Melania Trump\nYeah I mean I don't see her I'm In a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the prospect sniper at her I mean on a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um shoulder and\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump\nKnow ... my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if they published any of those photos ah the\nYou just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap erroneous I Know uh and then here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman\nIn the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on you know of\nCourse she couldn't go out to their cocktail parties and all that\nIt it it there you do your commentary on the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big thing is could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I played the media hinted at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him because she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her\nWho's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made him I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on I mean was brooding\nRight okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine um then\nBecause of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and ... with the president or whatever they did ... okay now why\nDoes anyone care\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what he wants to buy\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump\nAll right and she's told everybody in Tennessee that gets them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is\nNo I don't and no one else does either this is a tremendous example\nA political correctness that tiny ... going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I Want I Want to come back because you I Need to you maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to get a little a little more animated here ... ah but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto\nUh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart\nI think that there is a change a foot and the Democrats don't see it and when they get their head handed to them or by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill

heard of it of course a concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it it was known a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a

forward what was going to happen and we became upon an idea that we're in a separate separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day as a\nAs a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do clean I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever come forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job is could this could go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be

than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist [laughter]\nAnd I'm like that are just moving in ... when he was the second best when he was he did have had it he's number one and then space by our space butter space by your\nNumber two [laughter] how moving in that way this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talk about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them ah because we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided and were arguing all the time because we're not arguing at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the fart factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convince for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs and our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kinda I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had David Reuben who else a stew here recently Michael wrecking walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand the distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal in a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy if somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you are and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and a leftist that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God's says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside outside of\nThe Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy\nPelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where\nShe is it is the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex P Keaton wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed we wouldn't bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or any later I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch them never\nExcept for when I'm On the air that you're there for them to India and unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want\nThe audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job great without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... long form it's just toxic ingestion and that the vast yeah me and my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watch the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nMe away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine why ...\nThinks that Medicare for all is okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year at your money to Planned Parenthood she's not fine with\nThat stuff ... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication because we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know\nThey are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like were communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and of capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an
