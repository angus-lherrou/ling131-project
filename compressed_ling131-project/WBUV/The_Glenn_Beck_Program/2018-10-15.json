Faisal at an egg one today and get a ... I really\nMy experience with Katrina and and uh I have a new really\nYou think you understand what people are going through but until you put your feet on the sand uh\nThen it really hits you the scope of the problem and so it's always good that uh our leaders go and see in person\nBecause they don't have some ambiguous picture in their head they really need to see for themselves so he'll be landing there this this morning a will be giving coverage that will be going live when he does make his landing if he has a comments today so we'll be carrying that\nYou know I ... no I'm Sorry Kelly\nApologies I'm thinking about the evacuations today because I Would think that a lot of them\nAre either thought about going home over the weekend or went ahead and tried to see if they could get home\nAnd and you know this situation it kinda complicates things when they evacuated started going back because they haven't had time to remove the debris to clear roadways so I Know a lot of people were running into some road blocks in that regard what have you heard\nWell there is of course they're breaking down those road blocks but there's bridges that are out I was talking to make a Ghana and you know we talked last week one of our reporters here and and she's from a\nPort saint Joe which was really heavily damaged by the storm and she says you know there's basically one road leading in and out for the most part is the beach wrote\nAnd it's in the forgotten coast she says because of these towns are isolated that typical air force base and everything over there that keeps the law that property occupied and she says well when that rages out she pointed a bridge that says well that means we can't get enough of that way\nAnd then there's another based on the other side of town that stats damage so it you know the roads cleared up but there's going to have to be some construction I Know Florida has really accelerated they put up a some pretty big challenges to\nAnd and to themselves they have this excess quickly as possible so that will change but really you need to be in a place where you're comfortable and just sit by the side of the road trip a wedding\nThings to clear it give yourself a little more time is not going anywhere\n[noise] uh but we did have something uh uh that has to be concerned and\nWe've been talking about in the air the small wedding Mexico beach was just about washed off the map\nAnd you've probably seen aerial pictures of it it's just that reminds me of um Gulfport a ... year in Katrina mostly go pork and they've had a the mayor said about two hundred and fifty chose to write out the storm\nMhm they've not been able to find all of them they've there's forty six people they can't account for right now\n[noise] thirty ... thirty five but I saw a report where the the police chief said forty six I I'm afraid that's going to be a tragedy that unfolds there I Do hope they find everybody okay and it is hard to locate everybody but after two or three days in the storm somehow\nIf you're alive you're going to let your family no 'cause you know how sick they are\nWorried they are so I'm worried that we may have yet to really get the whole human tragedy out of Mexico beach\nI I Do remember you know you're talking about the challenges they have a had a when our bridges went out after Katrina and it it creates a situation where it takes longer to get places which at that\nAnd we're just glad to be getting anywhere so that's okay with you but I I tell you it was a modern marble to me to see how quickly they rebuilt the bay St Louis bridge and that's something I've never forgotten yeah\nIt's a male ... yeah when when you face these challenges it's amazing that kind of results you can get\nThat well we know over here or do we agree that if if we had been depending on the cocker bridge for our livelihood [laughter] it took forever to build that bridge immobile\nYeah absolutely you know it it\nDid but we weren't you know we haven't had a disaster it was just a I don't think we lost a contractor and it was but yeah those are our allies lines when we're here on the coast in our communities are so separated by water it's it's the beauty of the coast but it's also\nA it's also a\nProblem you have a storm like this because your lifeline ... your your communities or or isolated\n[noise] um and uh you know there's some

social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took may be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah ah so this was in in\nIn the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example ... is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is the\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered her tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know you had twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and\nCredible way they got a little gold star for [noise] alright are a sponsor this half hour\nIs zipper critter zipper critter is just as great company of ah of dreamers doors\nYou know when they first started they were ah this company that uh you would send in you know what you were looking for you would you would write your job and then they would go around and they would posted on all the job sites well since that time they have now become the leading job site\nOr and so they they they have just this pool that you that their poll polling from that is remarkable they also put it on all of the other job sites a but super critter has gone a step further they have just a

death or he is a even follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the the if not the mastermind behind a the\nA papers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the\nProgressive stack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and give it another go\nThey just it's just this is our act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're turning out privileged they are the students are ranked according\nThat their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in a very privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to sit in that without being contracted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um does the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak\nIn class or to be focused over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at\nUniversity of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't

but\nMean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all all the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill\nOr it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college hey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a\nControl everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter there will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just\nDemocratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump's sports for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind\nBut uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gives you just basically a country run by city I mean I you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way right\nAs they should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make that although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmlands trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's ... the house and Senate both exist\nSo to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the hand out\nRight and it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq during I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center\nI shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the ... this is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with the ... the several histories and our own MIT give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter]\nUh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America\nThe fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... last week the\nPortland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] [noise] what ... what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window\nHe's driving and he's like no I'm not garnered you're young women they break his window and chase them down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled\nBut what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how\nCan you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any\nWorse he's trying to make it sound as if um\nThe police this is his angle for the mainstream\nAbout the death of a CD from the naval construction
