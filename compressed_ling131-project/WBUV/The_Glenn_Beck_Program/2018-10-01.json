{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "\nAnd you're listening to Gulf Coast morning share on new software for nine W. B. U. V. in Biloxi and news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine to five bedroom to drag immobile news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back Darwin\nSingleton of NBC Fifteen dormant good morning\nGood morning good morning all our friends over Mississippi it along the Alabama ... um a couple of really interesting stories to start the Monday outlet\nYeah the the one and I I noticed the one about the ... the historic home and museum immobile or just about every town in the south of of a certain size has something like this and old home that they've tried to preserve\nYeah ... actually uh was built in I I think it was eight thirty three is not a hundred and eighty five years old very quickly approaching it to its bicentennial\nAnd uh it ... I remember one of the first places I went when I moved here Thirty years ago was to Oakland and you get a really good idea of how life was back in those days at that museum it's a it's remarkable place and if you haven't visited it's worth the drive in Mississippi over here but you got to do it soon because now\nI Can't believe I'm saying this it looks like the city is saying they're going to have to close\nAnd uh hopefully it won't be sold I I I just can't even imagine number one that this was happening that that we would actually close one of our\nBig tourist attractions and part of the soul of the city because of a funding issues the mayor saying that uh if they can't come up with more donations and the city is going to close it because it needs to work [noise]\nUh I I what do you think about this ...\nIt's it yeah it's um [noise] it it would be a terrible thing to lose a locally in the ... neighborhood no doubt about it it reminds me of when the mayor it was about\nTwo or three months ago the mayor let it be known that there was an enormous amount of deferred maintenance on city owned properties all throughout the city immobile many many millions of dollars worth of deferred maintenance\nAnd I don't know how much of that applies to Oakland you but it's another situation all of us that are homeowners can can understand how it it must cost a lot of money just to keep something that old in good condition\nUm I Am surprised Darwin that that that there hasn't been a bigger effort to try and and just at least maintain the property\nYeah I I Do I Am feeling that way too and and here's another reason why people\nOnly money to keep that place going if it's not enough at least they're helping there is a historic preservation society for mobility actually keeps to try to raise money for this and they're doing it now they're trying to raise even more might keep it open so uh you know the city's not alone on this\nUh but you know if you're just going to go willy nilly closing or or or uh selling off and they talked about selling some of these properties that they don't feel like they can invest in\nA there's something wrong with that I'm Sorry but this is this is one step at a little bit too far for me to take because a ... is a big part of the city's history and and tourists come by the busloads to see it uh and just sometimes\nSometimes these things don't make money\nThey but they are part of the image of the city and they're part of the attraction of the city so yeah I I certainly I certainly hope that they can\nRaise more money they're asking for a hundred and fifty donations five hundred dollars each to keep this going and I hope they find those hundred and fifty people but I also think it would be derelict to the city of duty my opinion ...\nIf if say close openly\nUm [noise] I I just don't know what to think about I Wonder what the mayor's even thinking\nOr or or if it was even on his radar when he's got all these other um I'm I'm going to think that the amount of money and hope that the amount of money to restore oh clearly is far less than some of the other big\nA deferred maintenance problems like for example led stadium immobile could yes you have to take care of the problems locally uh for a fraction of the amount of money it would take to help lab\nAnd don't even get started about Gulf ... a quest but right but here's the hey I Wonder if Denny Lippert listening maybe he could or we could we could uh get some help from him you know he has today's homeowner to the show or they take on projects all the time what a good high profile project this would be\nI'm On that out there any I don't know if you're listening but I mean you know I I Would love to see something like that\nI was thinking the same thing I mean we've got or watch a very good home builders in in our area uh you'd think that a lot of them would you would want to maybe donate a little time and effort into going to work there and they are and and tried to help to look like\nSure why not a so that that's just the thought and uh I think I'm\nA tea I'd hate to see I'd hate to see them sell this property I it would be at an abomination I think if they do it now that's not been suggested but that is the route the mayor's going with some of the things that he feels like the city can no longer afford to maintain but to selling your history\nAnd I hope that's not on his list so in your history would just not be acceptable I don't think that's just the way I feel about it and uh every now and then I'll get on a soapbox about something that feels good for the city\nThis is what I this is how I feel so I think you kinda feel the same way\nWell uh we're we're almost out of time here we've got about we are we've got about thirty seconds [noise] are they are I Know you love gardening would you volunteer to do the gardening and Oakland\nSome of it okay [laughter] so I get to enjoy the end but you know I yeah I Do like to

Rapids\n\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Brock Obama's head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true\nShe goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before\nI continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any is CNN's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting\nHave either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for profit institution but before the committee\nNor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard\nAnd quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\n\nYou might say what difference does it make well\nIf you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen you're in ice\nSchool so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens\nBeen saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years [noise] it\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen\nEighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick ... events of\nHer life why is this significant well because if the attack happened when she was in her late teens or in the mid eighties\nThat'll be reviewed and should be able to be very helpful as the investigation those ball\nSuspect Markey's flowers remains hospitalized in Jackson after being wounded in the

the capital thing and I I\n\nI Want to talk to those people who I think are reasonable\nWho can look at Ford and see her testimony and say okay so why why why wouldn't we just do the FBI thing in a reasonable world you're you're absolutely right in a reasonable world you're right but this is not about Ford\nAnd this is not about making sure that these charges stick its why as soon as this happened\nAs soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on we want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed now they're going after and saying he lied about drinking beer\n[noise] okay he was for the love of Pete people so\nThis is how do you look at how the accusations that he wasn't by out drunk I Know how would you confirm he well I Know I Know it's ridiculous I Know so\nUh we get into that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one [laughter] um but ah they've changed the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does it's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not me this about Kavanaugh they've\nInstead made this about victims\nEvidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff Flake\nHey I'm Sorry I'm my national and all and he goes I may not have to go there and that you might be doing is not\nA mile and then a woman's heart is not Tyler among them\nThis woman has obviously a horrible experience in her life\nSo when she hears an accuser she immediately believes the accuser well that's not reasonable she's obviously very very upset because of what happened to her and she wants to send a message that that's not right I agree with that\nBut that's not the standard of justice or the way we get justice let me take you to a real life scenario I didn't understand America when OJ was let go but didn't understand it I I Know what is happening how can the African American community be cheering this guy\nWell it's very easy once you're away from it emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy [noise] what\nWas happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black guy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars and so they weren't rooting for him\nThey wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy could ... could go to court and not to be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against the system\nTotally understandable\nUs the African American community now same people did O.

one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean\nWe're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow those communities operate\nI mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school\nAnd nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just it's ludicrous and then that eight and a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened the cheapest frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man all\nMe and my buddies we were the college checks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept\n... you can see on his calendar he literally has notes of what his parents would grounds him I mean this guy was a complete door in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel\nIn the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we've abandoned a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on\nMatter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things\nOr because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty\nBecause the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat ... that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nThey all know it yeah so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and let me tell you I think uh [noise]\nDr Ford who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right\nBut when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I\nSaw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank while he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam have Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this\nYou know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right in the ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right that the guys calendar clear is that right it's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's a debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you you are asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside a less\nYeah see I find something new global that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell you've got to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going up here stay right now and based off its own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not bred cabin where we are not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine but well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family\nGot like two young daughters coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them politically or ideologically that state and that's what they do and and banana republic that in third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run to talk ... we'll talk some other time but thank you so much [noise]\nI really want to I really want to hear from people are and that can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um um\nWe just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the

how are you\nEh Glenn how you doing good morning\nThe morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white they weren't married he was in the sixties that's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started\nThat's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption so uh my bicycle father was not in my life so I don't know\nUm what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was a ... who was my mother um was German and met my father\nWho was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx and that's where I was raised by stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers on the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in the bank\nShe then I left and we all we live together we we rate got enough money to we actually are packed up it was out to Long Island when I was around eleven years old my father finally made enough money my mother we work hard to get that we got out of the the bad neighborhoods you got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you I was a twelve okay so\nWhen my father died um my mother's down there was a Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family um abandoned us also so we were basically now\nI'm at that point it was very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get outta here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what am I go off and then to join the army that's what I thought it might go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army so I go off to the recruiting station um and this case they're all for recruiters\nIn the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells

were even\nHow would you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nOne or two times than work\nIt has words that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote because a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to have three percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single election in the entire nation not as a whole\nOther things that were more broadly as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight and it does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] name will be a massive massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete rebuild of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that that people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and\nWashington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency is a problem with local governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what is that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's a show where he's an old the theology to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we throw it away awhile ago yeah [laughter]\nBut yeah that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community\nWe don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation end through lowering spending\nHere's one idea that does both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing [noise] how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got an a business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area and hundreds of thousands of cars pass at every single day you will easily dropped the main dolls and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's popular says Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he is the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it\nSo we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now when you if they collapse we don't have enough money these guys do will have to have safer bridges less money and guess\nWhat we can start with holes in New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars an hour if you're a truck driver I Know a truck driver you'd pay by the axle\nYou're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we\nAre running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you\nHow do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this would sell in Texas how do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already selling\nForward the
