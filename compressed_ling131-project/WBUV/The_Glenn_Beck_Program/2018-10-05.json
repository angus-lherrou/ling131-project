I'm Glad to be here are you this yeah yeah I I'm a I'm\nA it's a forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote for the Republican side that is going away\nAnd I'd love to get first your gut reaction and then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear and then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute\nYou're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for Kavanaugh it is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... interview cannot cast your vote in any other way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other\nMy gut was see America I'm with my daughter yeah right I mean yes okay now\nLet's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah from Montana okay so senator Danes from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them either this is\nOne of the most important in game changing votes or of maybe his lifetime or it will if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this\nTo anybody ... how do you just because my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still won the vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's ... ... let's play the game though yes forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ...\nWell no it's well yeah I mean it but again like they mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican [laughter] so let's say ... signifies today or is that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's and said forty nine forty or not it's not a sure thing you need Danes I've got to say like\nMy it's it's hard with your gun was title with my daughter but in ... and the end you you rethink that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was\nMy initial thought was this is really important I think of my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screw this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started sick started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote yeah you know they're they're planning on doing by the way if they need Danes they're going to delay the holy until it comes back oh jeez delayed the vote\nWell only if they need him right now that doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow to no\nNo they can relate to that on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new accusations over into the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "05"}
