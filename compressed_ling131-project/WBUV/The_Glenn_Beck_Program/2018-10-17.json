of the plane\nA few minutes later the reporter could see a stint haze that smoke and smell something burning one of the crew members told a reporter it was from a malfunctioning communications unit that had overheated but the White House has not confirmed that\nWithin minutes the smoke cleared and the smell slowly began to dissipate the first lady's plane return to a joint base Andrews landing safely a new plane is now being prepared for the first lady's trip to Philadelphia daily\nJohn President Trump's not happy with the Associated Press calling it fake news over headline that he won't

From Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly man and one is tough one for nine WB the heart radio station [noise]\nYeah I don't mean to climb down combat\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing a antifa they are excusing everything that Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said it's time to bring the guillotine out for the\nRepublicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\nWell I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh\nVarious ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper a with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in\nAmerica which is you know what killing the s._s. was really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and our ... elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize would legalize narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nAh I beg to differ with you on the and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them and we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say at the you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust would have found is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nViewing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization\nBut but on the first thing you look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with Trump into basically\nDismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran\nAnd the middle east it's\nThe leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran's terrorism and destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of\nCountries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nNews talk one oh four nine whether we'll start devoting series of low clouds in fog and

with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised\nBecause out of the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolute health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded I'm ...\nThe ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society\nIs that true [noise] we we\nDid it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because they you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so yeah\nSo you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this mhm um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain

clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from ... Oregon yeah they are you are telling me that you were trying to organize ... yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their ... or done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can they'll they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacks them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf of what I see all the time when I go to these places\n[noise]\nAnd these are ...

tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible I'm interested in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here in life is\nIs winning by a much larger margin or ... I don't have the one and right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here does yeah I Know is you know when there's like a hundred by so much he's up to eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were avid is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asking the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... you think of it is great red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nAt it this way try this on for size\nAh a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "17"}
