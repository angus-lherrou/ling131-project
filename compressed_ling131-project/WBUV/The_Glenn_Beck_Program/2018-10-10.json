Ninety nine five FM the jak immobile loose headlines coming up in ten minutes\nA welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin good morning\nGood morning how are you all this morning\nWell this is one of those days where Darwin has already been on television anchoring a newscast and now you've also been reporting on a\nNews story in portrait Alabama\nYes uh you know we've got all of our crews hurricane oriented right now but uh unfortunately uh we we've had a it appears I haven't got official confirmation but I'm pretty sure it was a store clerk who has been shot to death in a robbery attempt as what it\nLooks like to me and I think that may prove a accurate a little bit later on today when I get the official word or this happened uh on highway\nForty three at the a one stop which is a small convenience store that are\nUsed to sell gasoline doesn't anymore [noise] so uh that's that's basically all I Know right now so I'm I'm hoping to get more information I'm On my way to a Pritchard city hall\nRight now the police department ship I can get confirmation on what I Believe to be true or in the meantime everything's focused on Michael right now and rightly so boy this at seven AM update\nThis storm went from not just a category for but the the speed when speech went up to one forty five which is a very strong category for thinking about being a five\nYeah this thing that built so fast Darwin and I really have a feeling that a lot of people in the Florida Panhandle uh you\nKnow may have decided they were going to stay it was going to be okay this would have been yesterday afternoon when they were talking about a category three and you know you check on things this morning I Do you find out the situation is much more grave and things have changed and I know I've seen a lot\nOf traffic from Florida on our coast over the past day and oh yeah I I think we're going to see even more of that today I think a lot of people that may have thought they were going to stay yesterday could be leaving this morning\nWhen you think about what a big difference it is I mean a\nCategory three to me is just uh to to me is like I'm I'm Out of town I'm Sorry it to my right out of three absolutely not yeah we're looking at a very strong for mhm and uh [noise] just talking to Jake done our um morning meteorologist\nAnd he says you know we just went up five miles per hour but hey when you start talking one thirty when's plus it doesn't make much different it it's going to be just catastrophic anyway and I don't and I don't understand why we have soundbites with people say oh what a ride this one out\nUh I I saw one soundbite that we had yesterday and I I I think it came from our sister station in Pensacola a but it was a mom with her daughter saying yeah we could rise that we've been through them before I I'm not sure what she was anti might've been a really\nEye of the storm city but I I just shake my head I thought how ah how selfish you you get your family out if you can uh it's it's just it it amazes me\nYeah we um I saw the same things that you were talking about Darwin ... the people that I saw on NBC Fifteen last night that lived on the water\nThat we're talking about how they just were not going to leave it there were not going to leave him with now were they were in an evacuation zone I just could not comprehend it now you have to wonder all they have tremendous regret\n... is a is\nReally going to be serving them not much good\nLater today because I now the water levels are rising I'm not sure anybody could get out now and they won't be rescuing you until it's safe for them to I mean if you're hearing this right now and you are in the path of the storm and I I'm not sure how far are coverage goes to the east\nBut if you know someone who said I'm going to stick it out good grief call up say if there's any way and get out now get out and now this is\nThis is going to be a one for the books\nYeah L I N weaving if it's\nNot I\nFocused a lot on storm surge which is always one of the most dangerous things you experience during a hurricane but this one where it's not just storm surge it's wins I mean\nThis is really yeah everything that hurricane can bring out you this thing is bringing\nImagine it's a two by four going through your home at one forty five miles an hour forty five miles to a hundred to ... now a ... that's what happens to breathe gets picked up branches trees\nAre we ... the last two tropical storms that we had a very minimal ... hurricanes that we've had we've had trees fall on the houses are trailers and kill people glass to storms that we've had uh this is\nI I just I don't I just don't know I I uh I feel helpless sometimes or telling people number lists in these interviews\nBut you know you can't hear Florida they say it's the way that tuition but they can't afford to leave all\nRight so all they can do is say hey you know will come and pick up the pieces if there are any loving dramatic\nRight at all not at all this is this week we've been told this one is going to be one that will be long long remembered because of the intensity of it

I mean 'cause I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight and I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children you know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do\nDuring the health care bill she and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded in to the\nCrowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember that\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC and not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nAnd by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like ... cities and\nThey're taking over that's ... that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that they got their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying\nTo what ... cents on causing truck in tents on causing trouble\nYeah I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right it just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say\nYou know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though\nIs that the media does not see harassing conservatives that's causing trouble\nCorrect that is the issue correct they see this as a parade that says like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people\nYou're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nA [laughter] things but uh yeah I mean they try [laughter] the Irish guy who runs this other art [laughter]\nLet me tell you I mean the white people they those are white people really do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob\nA now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtest is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest it looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I only around and said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route as he said knock the crap out of them are what you and says say okay that's not the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push protesters scared to sorry\nSorry [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] so I don't know\nTill they go anywhere [noise] the the [noise] now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says ... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting a football field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically has almost killed he was showing this is for healthcare catalyst in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and six of my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to do things\nI feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation ... getting their face they have to realize that they bear some responsibility if there's over ...\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like broke Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested for the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence\nIn some of the people in the panhandle who decided to stay put and ride out the storm will probably wish they hadn't as the water comes up\nAnd that's where a couple of Mississippi search and rescue teams will come in Chad Brian is a task force commander for one of those Twenty one member teams who specialize in swift water and flood water rescues he says they're standing by now immobile waiting for the hurricane to hit\nThat weight started actually want to do and they have actually spoil\nBrian is a battalion chief for the Gulf War fire department and he says they're happy to be able to help their neighbors you know we've been on the receiving\nEnd of anything and you know maybe we like\nSearch and rescue teams could wind up staying in Florida for about two weeks also helping to assess the damage once the storm has gone on the Mississippi coast this morning a tropical storm watch continues along the coastal flood advisory wins today could be gusting up to thirty miles an hour or\nOne of the biggest problems in getting help for people with mental illness is overcoming the stigma and the Mississippi Psychiatric Association today is kicking off a new campaign called mending Mississippi mine's which encourages churches to help start a conversation about mental health\nWe really feel like there's many ways that the church can be involved whether it is from the ... or whether there's something put at the church bulletin whether there is something that's put on social media whether a support group is for\nAngela landers the executive director of the association which is distributing information to churches about mental health you're up to date on news talk one oh four nine W.

twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and instill gets that's\nYou know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto well then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nFrom a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the clan\nA clan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it he ... to the military I had all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen on word well that's because of re segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the

our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage of a nice time you can talk about outright\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an under\nSo the topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime at a younger age and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal\nSide and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around\nThe world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has faced their challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nOutrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now\nOne of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around they give us American Woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not performing mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of the bus and I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the go those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to\nIs to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions are so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all\nJust strategic clean you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and
