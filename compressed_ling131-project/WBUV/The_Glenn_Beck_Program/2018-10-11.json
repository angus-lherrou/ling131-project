M. and Ninety nine five at them the jag immobile\nWeb news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin good morning\nGood morning and it's a beautiful ill on the Gulf Coast today which often or store with go the clouds go away and we're left with beautiful sunshine and destruction at least a step Pensacola\nDarwin this uh this storm different from a lot of the hurricanes that we've covered over the last several years and that it did do a lot more wind here all those other stores we covered water seemed to be the big the big element of danger in damage\nThis window a classic wind event\nI think you're going to see a we were talking about that this morning and behind the scenes or during the news I think you're going to say more\nI don't think we've seen all of the water ... because if you think about it most of the pages you said has been in town\nAnd the different towns along the coast I think we're going to see more uh right on the coast is probably going to surprise in shock as a as we start counting the days after the storm but uh we end I mean think about it we were just a couple a couple of miles short of a category five hurricane\nAnd it was a category three last night well inland doubling the Georgia I mean that's just unheard of a category are you that far inland usually they died down pretty quickly so yeah\n... wind is going to be a major deal and I don't think we've just been saved the extent of damage inland for Alabama I just it will probably see that more in the evening news tonight\nNow Darwin I Want to ask you from your perspective as a TV person I've watched a lot of the coverage on national networks yesterday and on NBC Fifteen and I saw what appeared to me to be news reporters putting their lives at risk\nPutting themselves in physical jeopardy to make sure that they were in the picture as they reported on this storm um is that also is that something that you're are you instructed to do that or do you do have the option of not being in the storm when you're covering something like that it looked really dangerous\nIf there's a news to write to the demands you get out in a storm like that then that news director needs to be hired\nAnd does not do that our our it's our our ... wants to make sure we're safe number one he had a kid she totally gets it but uh you know some thought they were say oh we aired each but Lester Holt from it you see this morning when they were in a secure a building\nUntil it got so bad\nThat uh they had to put them access so or the the glass window at the hotel because\nThey were they're starting to pop a and I remember watching an ABC reporter uh going live from in her hotel room saying oh I Can't stand that without a more this too dangerous in fact this is so I've never seen anything like this in my life she said I remember that uh but there are others\nWho are caught storm chasers right and we get we get some video from a life story media company that does this and they have their own critical storm chasers and it's what they do an adrenalin thing uh\nYesterday one of them got in trouble if you go to our Facebook page or go to my professional ... ... page I might she be Facebook page I posted a this feat that begets about forty five minutes and it begins with a credit there it's a one of the large dorm media\nAre reporters and he was in danger he he started out driving along I think highway Ninety eight in Port saint Joe\nUh and then he and as a friend who are in the car or or to partner with them starts talking about it or they get really getting at is it and they they get off\nThe main roads that go into a neighborhood and they start looking for a place to park that's that sheltered or are they find a place but then all of a sudden you see\n... and their their cameras running the entire time to the dashboard you see water start coming down the street in front of the camera and you hear them saying we are in danger and the winds going in there trying to get out of the car and finally they do get out of the car\nAnd you're left in the car with the camera that view or is this is still alive and it's recorded now you can see it but it's\nHere to say because they're gone and you're in the car by yourself with the camera is you're watching in your car starts floating\nAnd it is the quickest thing I've seen that a long time they managed to get up into a house that was on stilts\nAnd ride the storm out [noise] so and the guy was watching our feed that owns a house and he on Facebook and he called us last night and that's how great got that interview but yeah they were in danger I wouldn't do it\nI I you know I think it it shows people though\nIf you don't evacuate this is what you're going to experience and it has only value went all\nThat to me was that it was because I watched that and you feel like you're in the car that by yourself ... watching this happen and wondering did they make it out alive Kelly it was it's one of the most powerful things I've seen in a long time I wouldn't recommend anybody do it\nBut I recommend everybody watch it because it will make you think twice about saying maybe we can ride this out and on my Facebook page and and watch it it will it will show all your blood\nWell you know when I'm making about this morning Darwin I Know we're running out of time but the ... and they see all that devastation now they have to decide when is the best time to go back and it's a balancing act because you've got to wait until they remove all that debris and it said for you to go back but you just don't know what you're going to face when you get there [noise]\nIt's just horrible ...

it out to exactly what we did\n\nWe're going to take you to a story I I thought was a joke I thought was a joke\nThe Russians gone how deeply are they into our into our consciousness\nWhat will they

you\nDoing well Glenda\nMorning um tell me this is a joke\n[laughter] it's not a joke um there is a study out I'm from Martin bay at the University of Southern California at looks at the role that on

so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... pop it accounts\nYou were talking about a a moving target people who are deleting their accounts changing their information making new accounts\nStaying active so that they can't actually be tracks to end given location and if Morton ... researcher at USC could prove definitively that these are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned as what behaviors did engage in debate speak in all caps what words do they use and then as they are out there the next week when you looked him up again these are sort of things\nThat you look for when you're talking about foreign influence on line and it might be rushing that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they landed limit what did they plant into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen accounts exit specifically be Russian lengths a hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are jumping on line in the last Jedi comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie\nAnd then they start throwing in the ... about the ... not the admiral admiral hold though and then they start throwing in tweets about how a masculinity is under assault because ... and was unable to lead the ship\nAnd then they started rolling and tweets about s jade W droid than the fact that there was a droid in the\n... remember those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing blended that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the spot in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it\nIs reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's
