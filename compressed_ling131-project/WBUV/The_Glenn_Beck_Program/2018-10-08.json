the Gulf\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or a you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it\nYou know they they're they're biased detectors are always working\nUh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine they turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm\nBut this is an algorithm I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities\nTo track you know that is scary\nIt is you are you leave this out in the in the um creepy line\nI'm about how Google has really stripped itself a bowl ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise]\nUm and then ah ... how they have ... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrectly you have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national\nStudy in the last almost no one was aware that they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent\nOf people in the study uh could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this

biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of cases um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is his you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey've known in all this is like a lot of it as a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is near the ... that it was\nSome real credibility again comes it comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he described Hillary voter right right um but\nBeyond that uh ... seems incredibly helpless to me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time\nHow do we move how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and they're slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talked about that stuff all the time but I Know that I can easily supporter you know a a candidate that I like right like I can\nVote my principles easily 'cause I just do it right it's but it's harder to make other people change with the

in an Android which is the largest operating us you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're not if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know ah the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used it's it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep stuffing you but I don't even know how just to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with\nCertain browsers a use other uh you know all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go deaf duck goes a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using that and I went to ... go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like\nThat what did he say three hundred million word yet documentary million ...\nIs like a ... of of\nData on you and that ... million pages and pages of data\nAnd again like ... but I I don't know what is the personal cost to me in that data\nWell there's several things there are some things you could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent goes away the Google wants them to go that then that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to\nThe problem is not today this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and\nYou know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and went okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah\nBut I mean it's all in their right right\nIt's it's it I mean if you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter or is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that's that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think\nAs a catastrophe ... right like you think of the worst case scenarios but these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a Roach search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw the ... really AK ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and that this stuff escalates they're going to feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I ...
