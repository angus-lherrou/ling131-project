scared at the test itself she scared of the ... that I can tell the information it has to like ... yeah\n... okay I didn't expect it to the as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nStress you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test never\nNever maybe the FBI I demand an FBI investigation on Monica el McClain\nWho is a lifetime friend of Dr Ford because there is no to use this word carefully than accuser we have to define that here in a second and the shoes are saying that Dr Ford and Monica McLean\nMonaco was interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford help McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and help to McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nLet me play this audio again of what she said under oath\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone any undecided your attorneys anyone how to take a polygraph never never and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of chips or anything like that\nNow and it scared at ... air that was ... below that mhm I can see how the information and that has to address the or whatever or heavy on or I didn't expect it to the as long as it is going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nBecause you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test one never never\nNever well we know somebody's lying here\nWe know we know someone is lying right do we still because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it any better she now that you moved accuse she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a professor even be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant ... how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the

against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea\nThat you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry which will play directly into what they want to happen\nThey want us at each other's throats they want us to be irrational they want us to be angry they want us to just to start swinging and blind rage\nThat's their plan\nAnd until you understand what they're doing until you understand that this isn't really about Ford this isn't about the charges this isn't about anything\nThis is all about the patriarchy this is all about white men have put together in this case a\nRape culture and they have kept

not laughing they are smiling and they are cheering but they are not laughing he's not meaning this is a joke he is instead\nStating the facts and the absurdity of this case\nAnd people are cheering

look at the word booth\nYeah devil's triangle so this is this guy different court is a little bit a victim that was the one oh one class [laughter]\nA person harmed injured or killed as a result of a crime accidents or other event direction\nA person armed and killed or injured yeah a as a result of a crime or an accident\n... okay you know one of the one interesting thing as an observation here Glenn on the victim is if you call her a victim you are condemning his guilt\nOh you have already decided the case if you call her a victim huh when you are in a headline for example and you say he ... a mock victim\nWhat your saying is Brett Kavanaugh Kevin always guilty correct so you're saying it without having to say what you're saying what you should say instead could you look up the word accuser accuser yes here okay ah accuser accuser\nA person who claims oh wait this is starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in it all her an accuser\nSo he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing\nAnd a A N condensing the ridiculous miss of the accusers claim we must stop using the word victim they are accusers\nThey may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know this is an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume

were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted books off of people's candles\nYams including a ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these\nThese issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to pay a set up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nAh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because he watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concerns\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers\nAnd only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um the these works\nIn an air and it was the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are a number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on\nSo one way this can happen is that as you described um the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still have the old copy\nNow that threat you can't ... I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war on well I Want to see what it was like when they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that once you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer and people have a local copy stored on their computer or their device um\nAnd and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally many services are often trying to encourage consumers to rely on their own\nOn the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example at the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie you have to access it through their ... servers exactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so\nIs it allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it would move those files strong\nMuslim affable you talking about ... go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do chew and a very different way I I'm sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\n[laughter] it's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou say it sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you\nHave that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in in capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor four years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year I'm old school mine well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's a really good [laughter]\nI'm married and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can ... I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver um there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to\nAnd work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and\nUh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver but they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold mine just look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world\nHurtling towards a fiscal sanity or insanity as soon\nAs a star start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity other than some sort of catastrophic event\nJudge Kavanaugh said he was in\nTrump's rally was aimed at helping Cindy Hyde Smith hold on to the Senate seat she was appointed to in the spring the president called her a true Mississippi patriots but the crowd in South haven included some people who support Chris McDaniel one of three candidates challenging Hyde Smith in the special election next month\nIn just a few hours a long awaited political announcement\nWill be at the courthouse in Houston is not a clock attorney\nGeneral Jim Hood who's finally jumping into the governor's race\nYou know ah ah I see the least among us getting to the curve in our state good\nWill be the clear favorite to win the Democratic nomination next year and offer a strong challenge to the Republican nominee who's expected to be lieutenant governor Tate Reeves although Reeves has not yet officially announced his candidacy who has been attorney general since two thousand four\nAnd he's the only Democrat still serving in statewide office\nInvestigators won't save a man arrested yesterday in ... might have been involved in the shooting last weekend the two police officers were investigating when they were killed\nLast week Williams is being held on several charges at this point though or keys flowers is the only suspect in the murders of those officers James White and ... ...\nY ... funeral is scheduled this morning in Brookhaven with services for ... tomorrow a memorial fund for the officers' families has been established at the bank or Brookhaven\nAnd you're up to date now a news talk one oh four nine W.

... on with is professor of law and I'm the author of the book what we buy when we buy now and you can find more information at the end of ownership dot com\nAaron so tell me what how you've been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term we're likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur in the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured\nRules were going to start to see people become more and more accustomed to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways I I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application\nAnd I think that makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe may I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I um I Do I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up and the motor vehicle contacts or the ... the way it come up um [noise] uh most most recently and most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long running American final Clinton a company makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing force to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative it discourages people from um from as he said tinkering with the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country that didn't come from\nGiant ... D departments they came from individuals\nMessing around with things that down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities but even even more broadly at\n'em if we're discouraged and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world [noise] and I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nThere is going to be no mortgage debt left on that house okay every reverse mortgage had what's called mortgage insurance on it that is how ... how the mortgage companies hedge where we talk about private mortgage each or it's going forward mortgage and we don't like that\nOn a reverse we love that because that's how you as a homeowner are able to protect yourself and guarantee\nThat your hedging for yourself that if you do it for goes above your value non recourse baking\nA come take your home mortgage gumbo Blaine guy this Saturday and one of my news talk when before nine WB UB and you can also reach me at five zero more to zero seven seven six zero zero or at mortgage gumbo dot com [noise]\nI've been over here here for thirty eight years and that sort of a lot about the company I worked for and the great friends I'll work with like Katie and say\nI agree well turn I've been here for ten or eight years working with you and everybody here on harnessing confident experience\nAnd I love being able to help people like ... and grace furniture gallery Walter and Katie I've advertise on I ... for several years and every one we deal with it a heart has made it was it's obvious that I heart is a great way to work soon your email Biloxi jobs that I heard a media dot com\nThe residential design and construction stab\nAt noble builders incorporated is committed to helping you throughout the entire construction process from the first ... to the last\nInstall do or not they understand that your home will probably be the largest investment of your life and they want you to rest easy knowing you have the best bill towns on the market new home construction on their land or yours targeted market locations in diamond head de Saint Louis wavelength passwords Shannon Long Beach to kill in Louisiana\nLearn more noble builders ink dot com\nAnd below the Gulf Coast so they now have the largest selection glue merchandise say very decade you'll find new metaphysical I buy that history is home to go smoking excessive\nGraham's widow the joke is one of the best job Monday through Saturday and Sunday [noise] [noise] yeah yeah twenty seven to one half\nFacebook there's something for everyone at Tom's extreme pizzeria eight inch pizza that are great for lunch the extra large does our family favorites and frankly grown micro cranes getting healthy choices for your meal and your family salads Huggies and hamburgers fourteen beers on tap\nAnd drinks at the full bar make tons extreme pizzeria on people's choice winter in ocean springs now serving breakfast Thursday through Sunday including homage pancakes practice beats in ... in downtown ocean springs\nAnd thanks for listening Biloxi you are listening to the Gulf Coast news traffic and weather station news off one of them for nine W.

favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and change the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move a singer directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and there's a very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yeah it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nA about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the point is if it's out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted different\nWet I wasn't that that wasn't a real armor\n[laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google\nDoing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very good\nAt it not the name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... is with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last\nConversation about\nInformation out of you know that it's true and we'll prove information will will actual information\nWill you be allowed to see or keep in the future\nFor somebody to say about our sponsor this half hour\nIn his car shield and I think our

you find it at the\nLine dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want to I Want to talk to you about the platform ing I Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative\nBoys let's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business area but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size that Google ... wait a minute wait a minute if if the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail and not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is\nGolf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states\nUse Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert ... signed this scholar who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um ran a did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor who\nHad taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nThere's that this is just the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much
