{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "A special bulletins our weather department proclaims that is a nominee of interest rate increases are headed your way your mortgage rates will be affected for more we go to any sign of mortgage jumbo\nMortgage jumbo squid Wainstein this Saturday in one minute talk went on for nine W. B. U. V. whether you're working downtown or along Casino Royale stay informed view traffic and whether you want to or\n\nA scout we can [noise]\n\nGot all of that a fellow Debbie ... rock and roll in the morning or afternoon [noise] pay shout out to the Facebook followers Tony blames Jeff Kathy\nJason and mark hey appreciate you spent some time with us today and all those folks who are also listening in hey just a reminder a saints ticket gave away mortgage gumbo dot com sign up for the newsletter gonna give away two\nTickets to the saints versus the buccaneers on December nights so get your name and that number all you got to simply do is go to mortgage gumbo dot com and then sign up for the newsletter weekly newsletter that kind of goes back recaps to show\nYou know has links to uh what I call mortgage gumbo TV or just put up a great a great a video this week that talks about the ten commandments of purchasing a home so if you've heard that in the past or not I kind of review that very important you'd be amazed on how many mistakes are made\nDuring the home buying process so go check that out as well on um on mortgage gumbo to be if you just go to mortgage gumbo you'll be able to see all of that pretty good stuff there in that regard\nAlright folk so we are seeing a transition from seller's market which we've been in years to a buyer's market okay so we're seeing a transition here so what that means is maybe the houses are sitting on the market a little bit longer\nUm you know buyers are able to kind of negotiate deals a little bit better so what you're what you're having a lot of right now and and it's why I wanted to bring it up is what's called a predicated offer\nOkay so imagine in it for some folks I don't know if they still do this or not but I remember my mom back in the day going to put stuff in layaway or hey hold this for now\nRight that would end up ... that's what a predicated offer is okay so here's the actual definition when offered to purchase is made in the purchaser must sell a property to purchase that property\nThe offer is referred to as a predicated offer so you see where I'm Talking about where almost falls into where it's like lay away\nLike hey I Want to buy that but I Can't right now so I'm going to I Need you to hold that for me\nBecause once I sell my house I could buy now where you won't have predicated offers folks is hey if you've got enough income or you can afford or you keep it a house for a rental or something like that and you don't need to sell but or the house to qualify for alone well then that's a little bit different than predicated offers won't come in\nMost people that are no okay you've got to sell a house before you can buy now the house so that's where ... come into play so I Want you to understand really there's two types of predicated offers okay the sellers like\nAn open provocation\nOkay the sellers like an open ... patient and will and will get into that uh in in a little bit okay so they like a open predicated I'm gonna tell you exactly\nAn open ... allows permits the owner of the property which departure source attempting to purchase touch it can continue to offer the property for sale\nIt give the buyer a first writer refusal so basically if Dwayne make say predicated offer on Todd Todd's house okay that Todd can tell me hey listen we're going to do an open provocation so I'm Still going to continue to show this property\nBut I'm going to give you first right of refusal which means it could be twenty four hours\nForty eight hours or Seventy two hours for you to be able to as the fire to remove that pride occasion okay so if that's the case you've got to make sure what you're looking at because what's gonna happen\nIs if they give you Seventy two hours\nAnd you say hey I'm going to take that then you need to put a contract that says I hate this house I'm going to be able to get this house and you'll see usually they'll acts for forty five or sixty days sometimes Ninety Days now in the cellar if they want to close out that contract Ninety Days that's three months\nSo you know maybe they're not willing to go with some of the closing costs or something like that but that was initially offered so that's all got to be considered okay the other type of ... is what's called a closed contingency\nOkay so you have an open continued see\nIn a closed contingency okay with the clothes stairs is hey that buyers willing to say that's fine it's yours or you're going to write this contract up and it's predicated on selling your house that's cool what actually of course the buyer likes that right\nHowever because then you gotta wait to sell your house most offers today that are being written folks or what's called an open contingency okay so the reason I Want you to be aware of this is know what you're ... you're negotiating power is\nWhen you're going in and when I say you make sure that your agents aware at your age and hey if we're going to make a predicated offer a you're looking at doing an open or closed\nBecause if they're doing it open here's some things that you need to be made aware of when you're making this offer hey how much money are you going to put down\nOkay because if you make an open provocation open contingency on your offer and they give you sixty days to\nYou you buy the house and they give you sixty days to get finance well if that doesn't come through let's say your house doesn't sell cars they put a treatment plant across the street\nOkay if your house doesn't sell you're going to lose that down payment money so you've got to be aware of going in hey how much money do I want to put up front on this thing\nRight so that's got to be something that when you're talking about a ... you gotta make sure that you're working with an agent\nThat knows that bought from holding the ground so to speak folks you got to be working with somebody that has your best interest because as Gregory rex talks about\nThe return of your money is more important than the return on your body how what am I outs here how can I get out and buy some reason I Can't sell my house how do I get out\nSo with that open provocation again that is what I could tell you now you're not going to see many close ... so that's why I'm wonderful again are closed ...\nYou make an offer tell them you got to sell your house and the ... in a cellar says yeah that school is longest that takes that spot so I'm not focusing on that would I'm focusing on is open ... or what's called open contingencies okay\nSo again you have to understand when you make that offer\nThey are still going to continue to show that house so you need to make sure that your agent that selling your home is being very aggressive in the sale of your home because you got to try to time these things out perfectly\nSo it gets tricky folks and that's why I Want to bring it up because I'm seeing more and more of this being done so if you're buying the house you got to try to ... to to Thomas thing out to wear your closing and that closing happened to the same time 'cause if not\nYou staying at the motel six and we don't want that\nSo if you have questions about this if you're on aware make sure you get what your age and if you're thinking about making an offer or you just want to get out of your hood and you need to put your house up for sale\nCalled me during the week five oh for two zero seven seven six zero zero I Will get you with an agent that understands ... that way you can have your out folks that's what we're here to make sure so again keep in mind open provocations versus closed\nSo case for half that of hey it's been another great we thanks so much hey let's go get 'em states tomorrow playing the ravens we appreciate your spending another great week with us and it's so next week gumbo nation keeps her at a pot [noise]\n\n[noise] from them and the U.S GMC studios [noise] this is talk for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd you know balancing your buckets is very important and so simple and that yeah but it's but you know 'cause we're looking at one big bucket and and if you ever have a big bucket of back in the day we'd have these gigantic ten gallon buckets we'd have to fill fill water and bring it one place you'd rather ... one summer and then\nForgot about him in the water belt reasons but never tried to carry a big bucket of water that spilled over the top what happens to a lot of that let's bill I suppose all over and that doesn't help you at all doesn't know and\nSo every now and then uh maybe you'll lose balance in and they'll all tip over be gone\nAnd so we have our money in the market bucket and the market goes the wrong way Mm we may just run into trouble and maybe we'll get overloaded as the market keeps going up like a does what are you going to do the money's going to continue to go up if the market goes up but at the market goes down this is what people forget about what happens to your money them\nAnd how do we know with certainty that we're going to have a count that has gross protection for the market protection from these protected from risk and also income for the rest of our life so we go through later on the show and the next day when I'm gonna start talking about the buckets but I wanted to just let people know there is a way\nEspecially if you have those lump sum this big lump sum and risky accounts there's ways to make sure that some of that money can stay in the market but other money the money that you're going to depend on it's gonna be there when you need it the most and that is all the way through retirement or anytime you need it we'd like to say you need it starts retirement wedding taking your financial and turn it to

pretty good after twenty five years at a company or I Hope so yeah so when you when you put money in the four one Kay what do you put money away for\nYour retirement that steady retirement income later on in life\nSo but the main problem I've seen is the options many times you don't have enough options or maybe you haven't had good guidance because you have a four one K. and the person who administers the four one K. you may luckily\nIf you're walking see that person once a year if you're lucky and you really have they've just say hey do what makes you feel good they really don't spend enough time with you and then you don't really know how the performance is or the hidden fees and therefore would\nCatch whereas personal experience tells me that absolutely\nSo again the four one K.

possible\nWell saving money to four one K.\n... does have some benefits are actually get the match into pre tax but some people find it unfavorable because the lack of flexibility yup inside the plant absolute and no income availability in there so what you're doing is you're saying I should put a lot of money and my four one K.\nI've built up this great balance but now my balance is at the mercy of the market okay now what if you were already at the finish line as far as you've you've built up a lot of money that account right could just have some of that money in a place that you never lose

the one of the ... for success with ... with the four okay or the other one raise those Evan baby steps one I Love ... wonderful love the stores throughout it but the success anonymous books with Steve Forbes is loaded with\nChapters on how people can make themselves better okay\nAnd Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I get and\nMake sure you retire when you're ready on your terms and waste a recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nSo that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food was ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup chicken something else to get the door you know it was like he would never waste the chicken as they would take the chicken bone or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey Stuart ... you go yeah so I ended up making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you are in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and\nIf that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the you're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement is make sure that the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not over paying on these\nRight and and a lot of folks maybe like throwing the food or\nIf they thought I was just garbage ... anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many feet right not statement where the fees are really show many times and it's looking at the actual products and strategies are in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really\nDo the recession proving retirement well it shouldn't be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your days ahead of their needs us right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes and value what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising retirement so about ... you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we ... we don't over analyze things we get a good team planners on her side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom design\nThe plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment or in real detail but nine ways to protect your nest egg off okay how your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement\nSo about a bird it sits in the nest and it's like sits on the egg and it gets it all nice and warm and it finally hatch is mhm 'cause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so exactly are because we want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides a million new\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic many of our listeners\nNow it's a big enough for when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and that goes out and I think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or to retire [laughter] I Would imagine they would begin going it is here\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five not\nAbout the time the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is it doesn't seem like a do you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made of conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two and more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas by spoken word\nOften causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from a dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways nine ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps nowhere to go by step\nDo these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plans\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talked to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and and certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous for it and that's what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I have four is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right us right that's right when the chance to become a guarantee when it's a hundred percent\nExactly when something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people charge you for\nYou and again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent or so we call it retiring which success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they tried to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute and once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race to verbal racer examine other word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but uh uh they don't really want me to have a great retirement that yep so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money and retirement and so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money and retirement but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do when\nWe want to do this right period mhm no disclaimer no but no uh most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy in radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking with a former central you had a caller call in and they said well a lot of visors say the four percent rule doesn't work it rained down market right and so he proceeded to say well it works signing up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad things [laughter]\nSo if if you've got to retire here's here's here's a good guarantee\nIf we reach retirement we have a hundred years of a market environment right\nWhere it will will the force that will be fine you've never run out of my ... and Wheldon Thomas we've never had a hundred straight years up in any market so if you're retired you know Murphy's law strikes a lot of times in the day he retires the data market goes the wrong way exactly you know so here's what I Want to do though very important we need to get educated we need to get the proper plan in place\nAnd we need to do with confidence and we need to be comfortable with our planner\nAnd are planning process so we do this for everyone who calls and right now for the next thirty call where we're going to we're going to double the number of callers will usually take at this time of the show for the next thirty callers", "show_name": "The
