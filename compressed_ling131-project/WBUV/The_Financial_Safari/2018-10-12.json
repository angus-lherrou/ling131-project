James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of Tennessee but the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view\nLater in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or center\n... oh wait do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWell they tell him well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico\nHave you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like\nWhy do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense a grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic difficulties as like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison if the President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to me I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with among stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred burning Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be\nAnd you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human our human family and talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat folks\nOn about his praying tiny west and the racial giraffe now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the printed as he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump administration's this\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you

played Taipei in his country outside I think that for their own and falling out somewhere picture of a ... I mean just to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television make at that but I think\nWe had a thoughtful play by play and political on out here not thinking is that with ... on our white\nI'm just going to be honest and they gave me a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy vibrant trend of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to any body this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd ... is a pack on that vicious horrible level I don't even know what to say\nMy friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and\nThe questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them is quote the people want to repeat what you just heard\nAt least the president also tweets he'll visit Florida and Georgia next week these types of trips usually allow a president to see the disaster first hand and be more understanding of the need for federal assistance usually in the form of money congressmen that gates represents parts of the panhandle\nDeaths disaster response relief is locally executed they managed in the federally supported\nMeanwhile the power and the water remain out in many panhandle towns Gulf Power says it could take weeks to restore full energy service Lisa\nThanks happen the president so far resisting calls in Congress to sanction Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of Washington Post writer Jim ... last seen nearly two weeks ago entering the Saudi constantly in Turkey which accuses the Saudis of killing him they\nSay that they have audio and video evidence that point to that effect last year during the reporting that that evidence has been shown to U.S intelligence agencies that Assad is officially said that he left even though video shows him going in but not coming out\nOf business networks Hebert Laurent that the White House the Saudis denied any involvement in the show these disappearance meantime American pastor Andrew Brunson held for two years in Turkey is released and then the judge convicted him on the terrorism charges he denied before setting and free\nReally they're real right now we're overjoyed but it might seem real his\nSister Lauren telling Fox that family is looking forward to a reunion an hour to the clothes on Wall street the downs up one twenty four fluctuating all day after two major sell offs and right now\nA rally this is science [noise]\nThis is talk went on for now the Israeli Army says it was defending itself as mass protests along the Gaza border turned violent again at\nLeast six people are dead and hundreds more injured after protests erupted along the Israel Gaza border for the twenty ninth friday in a row\nAnd Israeli military source told Fox News that some protesters were killed after throwing an explosive device and tried to take over an idea position today's demonstrations come amid particularly high tension as settlement talks in Cairo, Egypt have slowed\nThis week negotiators reportedly asked to mosque to stop the weekly protest and the group refused in Israel ...

I think you just cut through something really important I think we should describe this is the mask came off [noise] [noise] yeah\nI think it is I I I I think what's interesting I don't know I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by two out in Arizona Mick Sally believe it or not is now up by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe it was definitely gonna hurt\nIn the case of of course in cinema Marsha Blackburn who's up by eight in Tennessee\nThat is such an important race Ted Cruz's rebounded in spite of all the hype of the NATO Rourke and all the money that prone against Ted Cruz that it's such an important seat Claire McCaskill is down Heidi Heitkamp is down Joe Donnelly is down and I think tester is vulnerable in Manhattan I think there's a lot of Senate races\nThat are rich dark really winnable in this atmosphere where we just watched the Senate all stand in line but for Joe Manchin and follow Chuck\nSchumer is lead oh and remember if if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nI mean ... they're the same voters at the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important uh and again I'm I'm thinking out loud to you so because you you trigger the reporting you're doing his triggered this in my own thinking I think our folks do to start shifting towards humor\nI think [laughter] I I really mean is I think you could take you know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight\nAnd then you had any just put your foot on the gas and tell a joke you\nKnow no no no I Want you to put your foot on the gas even more but remember as Reagan often proved sometimes humor is more devastating than anger\nHe's right\nNow so for example in practice and I I really think marshes attitude of the big ... it's okay well I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor but don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\n[laughter] for it\nTo you really are I I again I think I think it's just something that I learned this in part from from theater wage great coverage oh John F. Kennedy and in Queens New York in Nineteen sixty or can anyone in this rough but we can before the election just just ripping the Republicans but it was all funny\nIt was all humorous I mean I think my Sally for example to take all of these crazy things that are up on her said weave them together into an eight or ten minutes fish will be like a vaudeville act\nIt's OK okay you'll Madeline saying\nThe Mets but all of the of the of the world than and\nThe people in Arizona are crazy I I ... I Can't ... I should be over now\nBut they have let us on the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the meth capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nIn life you know and I generally\nI think I think we should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also another thing that the there is no more moderation you know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party Mr Speaker that pretty\nMuch says at all that was one of the nice as human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today and survive a and and be because you just get more and more and more isolated I mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh you have people\nWho might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus only want to do with their donors only\nOne person and not to give them credit Joe mansion jump probably ... or you know I'm sure he got that helped me out of 'em by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan and that's what his vote to\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you because of your radical left his agenda maybe it'll even think about becoming a Republican or be wins and that is the one seat that seems saber red state Democrats the only one now this\nPoint I think that's right I think and and it really even Asia and if you watch the even when he voted for governor the numbers narrow the racist closer today than it was a week ago because I think what's happened is people hooked up and suddenly realized what a team sport this is\nThat you got two teams in and there's a really simple question for every so called moderate and I say this I Would also says to mention that she was really going to vote for humor\nSome fair question everybody needs to be asked that question that's a Democrat\nBecause we have because we've got to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in a neighboring state\nMean McConnell least understands West Virginia [noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia has Hillary Clinton has contempt as just recently in two weeks ago you know you add I'm\nNancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible about what's really interesting question I'll be opposed to ... why are you even running\nI Know if I go to vote for him or why run\nYou know when you look at things that have been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be symbol or\nJoe Biden saying in September of the Trump voters of the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable Z or ...\nBitter people clinging to their God guns bibles in religion I mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see the bread is an office beat the undercover video project ...

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and part of the drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet\nFor the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know they ... they want to get rid of ice won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nThat Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nI Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nUh I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat that problem is not me and then all of them are they stream and those are\nMade with it that are closer to the extreme conservative so he knows that it's not\nIt's simple no one Hans within a fast life oh no I'm\nA I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor governor the you love and vote for once me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice I Would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug I'm very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kit for Franklin square you're still you're still am when you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax may have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yeah I I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of them 'cause he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gotta get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely like she should go period\nAnd start absolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should've been on the should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nWell I think it's got to be not I I think\nLook if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you\nIf you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in a health care plan the free independent
