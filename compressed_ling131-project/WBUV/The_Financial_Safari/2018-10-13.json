go out to those folks over in the panhandle Freeh said everybody hanging out with us for the last hour a look my goal\nEvery weeks to provide education options to what I consider you most valuable asset you're home so\nAh Lovett hey if you also uh want to get more information from me make sure visit mortgage gumbo dot com and simply sign up for the ... newsletter we're up to over ten thousand people\nTen thousand people are getting a weekly newsletter that kinda keeps them up to date on there's always some industry news in there somehow so hack some fun things\nAre also let you know about some different events we've got a bunch of different events that were working on right now or that our annual towards the top fund raiser and all that stuff as well so stay with that hey let's jump in to ... watch\nSo folks have been talking to you all year about hey interest rates going up how does that affect things that has been free I've got some audio here check it out and then I'll give you my feedback on ... on the flip side\nOK similar I shouldn't be especially careful about running up credit card debt and rising right environment that's like ... if you carry a balance must tonight and nearly forty percent of American households do your interest payments are going out\nAfter the Federal Reserve's latest taking credit card rates are near record highs the average credit card interest rates or a PR is now Seventeen percent that's up from about sixteen percent a year ago\nAbout ... percent two years ago not raking climbs even higher\nIt's directly tied to the feds benchmark rate and the central bank has signaled more hikes ... last year us credit card debt surpass ... trillion dollars its highest level ever and according to the latest survey of consumer finance is the average household with credit card debt\nHas a balance of five thousand seven hundred dollars rising rates mean rising interest charges on that debt\nBut experts said that were words can take action now to reduce their payments in this environment just ask a survey from credit cards dot com found that there is often room to negotiate and more than eighty percent of cases where the consumer asked\nThe credit card company agreed to wave a late payments the Seventy percent of the time and animal feed was dropped or reduced and about half of those who asked received a lower interest rate\nBut despite these high chance of success only a small number of card holders are actually making these for black and this is important because for the economy at large the combination of rising credit card debt and rising interest rate credit hurt economic growth it can feel like they have left to fat\nSo ... a couple of points there that I Want to share on on this video cake number one and we talked about this on the show in the past\nOkay first off yeah look how how do you improve your credit score we talked about the success how we got people scores up Seventy eighty third thirty points just by calling an action for an increase in credit limit\nHowever you heard them talk about hey maybe waving late fees you could ask them to wave a late fee and maybe they will but that's not going to be a reduction in balance\n... reducing your annual fee that's always good thing that is not going to be a reduction in your interest rate okay so the only other thing that you've got there that she mentioned is hey listen expert what's a lower interest rate\nHey maybe at six months maybe it's a you know a three month or or twelve month hey any kind of lowering of your interest rate helps you heard her talk about their Seventeen and a seven to over Seventy percent or if you're a PR right now on an average credit cards with the household debt over fifty seven hundred dollars\nFolks that's a lot a that's a lot and that's a big number\nSo that brings me to again this is where you're saying when I told you for years that has been free this is what I'm Talking about when the federal funds rate was that zero\nThey wouldn't people weren't worried about it the stuff was cheap credit cards hey zero percent on cars do you think you're still going to see come by car with nope nope zero percent interest\nYou're probably going to start to see those commercials go by the wayside\nOkay some other things student loans we've already talked about that we just mentioned that somebody just actually question how can they get approved those payments are going up\nAnd then last but not least the devil's horns he locks folks he likes are almost like bitcoin was\n... for me anyway look good invested in it and guess what he locks were awesome this week alone had five people call me to get out of a he locked whether they're sitting at less than a four percent interest rate on their mortgage and we're saving them hundreds of dollars a month folks\nSo my whole point of this is he locks where you you they were awesome and I I don't want to just poo poo all over them he locks were great you used that you took advantage of it when the money was free\nTo a job but like red brick says when it got life all the time don't fall in love with an investment just because of its name you got to be willing to let go and not hold on to something when it's run its course and that's where he locks are folks\nHe locks have run their course and you need to get out of them sooner rather than later okay right now homeowners half a trillion dollars in equity okay that means sixty three percent of all properties hep C net equity jump\nAcross the country by over twelve percent\nThey've seen their equity jumpsuit tutu of twenty Seventeen accused you of twenty Eighteen by over sixty thousand dollars so my question to you is this\nWhat good is that doing if you have that equity yet you're paying higher on your revolving charge cards on your student loans or on that he locked that's going up you're much better taking advantage\nOf doing a traditional refinance and taking full advantage of that folks next month will you still have will your house still have a ton of equity yes well it's this time next year you know what\nIt scares me to say that I Can't sit here and say guess beyond a shadow of a doubt\nThink about the neighborhoods that you're driving in right now you're going to LSU party you're going to hang out with some friends or just when you're going home in the evening after a hard day's work those for sale signs are sitting there are a little bit longer right\nOkay or you're seeing the word reduced on them when you see the ... produced\nThat mean to sell her for a lower price that affects your equity straight up when how cells for less than it was originally lifted that affects you and I just want you to be aware of that\nYou've got to understand people that are selling their homes now are selling them because they need to it's become a a buyer's market which is which what that means is there's more negotiations in play\nThere's better opportunities\nYou can get houses for cheaper because it's a ... market okay so my whole point of view in this audio is to let you know\nI'm not an I told you so guy my job is Shipley here\nTo give you twenty plus years of experience on what I've seen with ups and downs\nAnd help you understand credit card payments are going to go up student loan payments are going to go up auto payments are going to go up your he locks or going to go up so look yourself in the mirror and go you know what I took full advantage of you he locked\nAnd I'm Don I use Jew but now I'm hanging you up I'm done with you in and look back at that house that you busted your tail for go you know what you did a good job for me let me look and see\nWhat this thing to do and get your cell phone a thirty year or a fixed the Fifteen year
