I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today\nUh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent\nThe meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nUm what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett much those legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the\nRussian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if he had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThey'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here uh\nShe reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence or and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was probably the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold year now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins speech brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student at Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was so critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost and all of this also critically important that you emphasize the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this that they were all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegation and a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that\nUm I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seen behavior by United States senators and has been going on the scale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive dreams couldn't imagine with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh who ... carved out a dish and you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale is the future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make um this is\nThe very same people who are land that the president for daring to criticize crooked FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera those people for whom stroke was a hero\nOr now criticizing the FBI this wasn't a fair a thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was that he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like the meter because he took it personally when\nIt 'cause I don't know they don't like his temperament was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but\nUh it looks like this goes forward it looks like Kavanaugh has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen\nLast minute you know insanity but I Will tell you we won the issue we've got to deal with and I'm I'm I got to say goodbye to both of you thank you both from weighing in on this Lindsey Graham is coming up but I Will say one thing\nI Will vote chicken

like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through hard decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a
