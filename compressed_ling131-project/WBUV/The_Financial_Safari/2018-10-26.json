be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind\nYou because ah you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but you don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up\nAll these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported and uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it there came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot on fake news CNN is they my ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part of what needs but basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah because here it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... or the Robert De Niro calling the president devil and us devil worshippers effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... so you may sort of\nLenient blaming me because the narrow got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a punk his dog he's a pig he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care fix these gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\n[noise] I'm On um\nHe's been charged to die with five federal crimes including interstate

very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amount it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were barber construct running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in a center account I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolute so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats blows you become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nOr just split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\nTo think of think of the intelligence committees set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's going to happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee ... there'll be relentless investigations are President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us Paul\nSoon as we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nDon't want it or they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that the Democrats\nAre mobilized and focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump said as a risk it's the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements are incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical to set the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to him his former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped a pay for Nineteen Ninety four in September that had we had the generic Republicans up\nSeven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour far ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even national and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be basically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come critical out for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the ... first before I'm a ... I Know John is certainly knew shot I just hope we stop demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters it saying\nTrump responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa plan that Democrats can we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan watery\nBuilt building the wall and having a pathway to ...\nOkay so that I hold trucker offered that deal to the Democrats that do have a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because I think it was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that in our heartbeat I think it makes sense or Don Lenny in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a half a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprise that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race ... are they in\nA mansion where when that will win a rail I felt\nThe same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mansion had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mentioned\nAnd I think mentioned did have an election year a conversion and that's all of the good\nElection year going to hunters and mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months they will go back to being the liberal we really are\nThat he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNow literally live in this environment that means it's just not a super radical\nYou know left wing lunatics that is all happening All right we'll take a break we'll come back more John McLaughlin Doug

become available they've uncovered recovered fourteen suspicious packages addressed two prominent people will get to that of course the blame game has been on since the first thing this morning\nAnd it's absolutely sickening the way especially CNN has been handling this and much more straight ahead right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections that turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings or tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future\nPoliticians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part\nSocialists left leaning Democrats and the New York state assembly and he's trying to cast himself as a Republican or a moderate in his district these narrow brief wants the word Democrat\nHe's trying to deceive and condo voters here and just say okay I'm a moderate I get along I work with everyone you know when he gets he sucks up to Cuomo in silver whomever is telling them what to do and he's one of the twenty four Democrats across this country who's trying to deceive\nThe voters by saying oh no I won't vote for Nancy Pelosi meanwhile he's taking a max the nation fourteen thousand directly from her count\nHer dark money superPAC spending billions of dollars trying to buy gas to George Soros icon style or who wants to impeach president Rosie O'Donnell just at a fundraiser farm in New York City Governor Cuomo Alec Baldwin all of these Hollywood\nLeftists who are all in just trying to attack the president and try to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally seeing a break free policies for this president\nBut never things to the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job\nOf courting so the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen I think it was eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become under Cuomo and\nYou know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it yeah\nActually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton groom county which is on the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which has watched so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in ... that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner in this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nI'm I've been around and just see I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet

remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nWell it's a different tack then you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for
