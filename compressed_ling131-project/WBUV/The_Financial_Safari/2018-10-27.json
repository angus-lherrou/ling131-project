[noise]\nOh Michael J. wonder how you doing [noise] those worms will join us crazy right [noise] Michael Jackson house this song crazy that was one of the greatest songs ever especially during this time of year happy\nHalloween folks let me be one of the first to tell you I'll be hitting a low Halloween parties and I put on by the title [noise] can't wait [laughter] gonna be a blast as I said I'm dressing up as a former not one in looking to win the competition got an old ... overalls\nI'll throw a plaid shirt on a straw hat and we'll go from there by decided to go scarecrow I'll go to one of the low cost to places and put some straw like in my shirt or something that's the versatility\nHey we provide education and options to you every Saturday right here on mortgage gumbo with Wainstein at one o'clock on a heart radio do you want to join a show Feibel four to six zero zero non not five hey just to talk about it a little bit about what we were discussing a second ago with interest rates in with everything going on\nLet me ask you this in in in this article came up and oddly enough I had a client this week will call me they've got some credit card\nThat they've got to he lock out there they wanting to pay off some stuff they want to do home improvements it's it's it's the typical client they've got some equity right they pay down their mortgage\nThey've got a four percent mortgage rate which is a pretty solid in this day and age right we're on we're we're on the way up way above that now\nSo called me to look at some options about refinancing to pay off some some credit cards\nBecause when he was wanting to do some home improvements\nOn credit cards okay so oddly enough there's an article this week uh on market watch one third of homeowners are paying for renovations with credit cards so my question to you is this revolving dead folks let me be clear is a fantastic thing\nIf you manage it correctly it is needed it's the easiest way for us to get your credit score up but you have to be careful folks you have to be careful\nThirty six point four percent of renovations in twenty Seventeen was done\nUsing a credit card eighty five percent said they use cash of savings to pay for renovations thirty three percent said don't use credit cards and only four fifty percent said they use it securing a home loan so that's why I wanted to bring us up you've just got to be smart managing your money\nThis particular client didn't like the five point seven five will save him about four hundred bucks a month and given 'em cash out to do is home renovations\nBut he thought he was going to use this credit card because there was a zero percent interest right one of those credit cards that's been sitting in a draw for six months and he would just pay it off then well listen if you had to thirty thousand in cash you'd be one of these other people that are using a cash to your home renovations\nSo you rarely just got to make sure you're being careful there so that's my point of the aisle discussing with every one is how we just got to change the mindset\nAnd get off of the fact that the interest rates are higher than what they were last year the interest rates are higher than what they were two weeks ago but that's okay it's not too late take advantage of the value of your home today and maybe look at all your stuff lay it all down you and your wife sit down have a taco\nOn may go hey let's just sit down and look at everything here and see where we're at and make the phone call and within Fifteen minutes I could let you know exactly what we can do\nThat settlements can wreck your life I agree one hundred percent\nLet me tell you how that settlement works folks number one debt settlement works by stopping paying your bills that is never good okay then you give a firearm a debt settlement from\nYour money so they can go to negotiate how to pay them okay\nWhen you give them when you save about half of your outstanding debt that will then begin to contact your creditors so you're giving\nThese firms all that money that number one is not a good thing that what they're going to do is they're going to call it try to make a lump settlement and I'm going to get into that in a second 'cause I guarantee you there's a lot of this that you do not know because I Know they don't mention is on the commercials\nOkay and then you pay the debt settlement company twenty percent\nOf what you save twenty percent you talk about predatory lending\nOkay so if you oh ten thousand dollars and they settled for five you're giving them a a thousand dollars to the debt settlement from\nThat's a lot of money so let's look at this so you oh ten thousand dollars\nYou settle for five thousand you get the debt settlement company which twenty percent of ten thousand folks to grant right so when you're looking at this do you understand that difference\nOkay that difference of what you pay that company you were going to have and here's the caviar that I Know you all don't understand\nYou're going to owe taxes on that three thousand bucks\nThat your creditors wrote off you owe taxes on the money that the creditors right off okay so the reason I'm saying you got to take out the money with the credit repair with the credit debt settlement company\n... were you aware of that that is a taxable event\nThat is why I cannot stand the debt management companies I cannot\nBecause so many folks do not realize what you've got so you owe the IRS okay in this situation basically you're twenty five ... if you're in a twenty five percent sales tax bracket\nYou're going to oh two hundred fifty dollars for every thousand bucks that you know if you're in a forty percent tax bracket forty percent of four hundred dollars on every thousand that you owe\nSo take that example ten thousand dollars you settle for five let's make it simple say you get the debt settlement management a thousand\nTwelve hundred and fifty bucks is what you owe the IRS folks you don't have to do that let's look at credit repair let's look at what some of those options are those who have worked with me understand a lot of times we let those sleeping dogs die if it's old debt\nWe're going to leave it to be we are going to leave it be\nSo the reason I bring this up is I'm hearing more and more and more of these people out there and I watch these commercials and it really is offensive to me it's almost like they're in pastors because nobody is understanding your credit\nWill be absolutely\nTrashed okay your psycho score will absolutely drop it'll be like throwing a walk off of a cliff or into the water\nOkay because what you've got to understand is watch that stuff done\nThese things are going to start reporting all thirty sixty Ninety Days late or longer they're going to be reported then they're going to have charge also on a charge off can stay on your credit up to seven years\nThat is going to be a tremendous effect on your credit score\nSo I just want you to be made aware of that and that's why I wanted to make sure it's not a whole bunch to go into but that's one of the things that you have to be made aware of\nIt if you had enough money to sit here and negotiate and pay some farm to they'll go go go negotiate you probably do a better job of managing that yourself\nCall me during the week I can just play more about this than I could tell you about I'll free credit repair program we got five oh for two zero seven seven six zero zero or even for a mortgage gumbo dot com say Dwayne let's chat
