[noise]\n... out not\nChange bank accounts folks if you're in the middle of closing and we've verified your your down payment money we verify your funds don't take that much if you get mad at the bank because they charge you a a ... fee or something like that don't do anything until you're alone is close\nSo with all of these commandments I Know they seem like common sense but if you're working with your loan officer just called them keep in mind you're buying a house not gumbo this is the most important purchase that you're probably ever going to make a one of the most as you buy more as you go get older\nThey go through different process to make sure just get what your loan officer an accident first okay\nSo folks say we appreciate it it's been another awesome we thank you so much thanks off color thanks for all the folks Jamie ah Anthony we got Melissa all those folks will watch it on Facebook appreciate it\nNext week hey we're going to talk about a little bit more stuff next week we're going to start doing this credit repair versus debt settlement you won't want to miss that show credit repair\nVersus that sediment out cruising the coasts folks to be careful out there have a fantastic rusty their weekend folks go tigers and who that on Monday hopefully reporting back some more wins next week 'til next week\nAnd they asked John keep\nHer in a pot [noise]\n\n[noise] from the men do Buick GMC studios he's talked going on for nine points and I urge radio station\n[noise]\nGetting ready for the big vote 'em Rogers stern Fox News ... hours away from what everyone expects to be the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next justice on the Supreme Court boxes Jared helping his live on Capitol Hill with the latest\nFirst quarter always soccer this well this was this was worse than his even though I was Nineteen eighty two and a quarter really soon after off the stage and are\nWe talking about that person was approach is walking into a store for a dress shirt and ask for Eighteen forty one at sleep so you see what happens what kind of looks you get when you get that\nSuffice to say Marty was not a horse racing ...\nYou know I wouldn't want it ... yeah well I'm thirty two thirty three and I think that's a almost two long some time ago I took we get the responses like I don't I'm not sure that exists\nOr they can do like cut one sleeve off it's actually like to see if they used to have little patches on the elbow they pay you are going to put ... on the table which I Do anyway [laughter] ... [laughter]\nSo accustomed to write Marty's accustomed Taylor fitting a plan but if you're listening right now and you want to get accustomed plan you want your four one K. analyze the big problem with ... a lot of people are participating\nThey're putting money in every paycheck but they really don't know what allocation of sweat that they don't know if the selections they have a good and they don't know the hidden fees that exist in there and by the way folks are a lot of hidden fees and four one K. or they wouldn't be pushes or we can analyze that for you get you right on track and go according to go through a Quarterly Review process with your selections\nAnd then make sure that when it comes time to make sure that four one K. now turns into a true retirement plan that income we can help you with that as well but the first step is to get a financial and retirement review looking at the road you're on right now the path you're going down and we take a GPS satellite view making sure that the road you're on right now will get you to the true destination you think you're going to\nAnd you'd be amazed how many people are way off course\nAnd they beat every year with their visor visor tells them everything's fine ... why do they tell them that that\nThat might be a place that that's why we stress the folks has come in and get that analysis done so we put an Eighteen page report together\nAnd it is the best of luck in opinion that you average it on your investment account we look at these we look at expenses and we look at risk adjusted return Jeff arm are returns where they should be commensurate with amount of risk that I'm taking which is crucial and that's what we call it the personalized plant\nSo we take those Eighteen pages and we consolidate them right down to one page lineage review and if your radio listener right now and you have at least four hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nThis review will be for you or strategies do work best but those have you with over a million dollars but as long as you have at least four hundred thousand or so safe retirement and in for one k.'s or not you're home you're home you're not going to sell your home and live in the streets of retirement but anything but real estate like that is right now if you have rental real estate that can be included in that\nBecause a lot of times when people get older they want to transition out of the real estate and into a safe investment that will grow it'll give them protection it'll give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd if you have rental real estate it all depends you only get into someone's paying your rent I write so we'll we'll put all that together for you if you're one of the next twenty call was right now and Marty the most important thing is they'll have their own customized income plan poked you have your own income plan if you call right now that you'll be competed in and it'll be true again it'll have gross\nIncome and protection all built in is a triple play the positive triple play in the financial world but what Marty talked about the most important part of this whole Eighteen page plan\nIs we give your own personal lives and customize calculated risk exposure level as it currently exist now based on their risk you're taking right now in the market what would happen if it went the wrong way what would a duty of portfolio and if the market keeps going up what would be on the positive side said well wait a positive person negatives the secret of retirement is to get that curve down\nSo if the market goes down you don't lose much if any of your retirement money now there's nothing wrong with taking risk but don't do it with money you're going to need\nAll the way through retirement we can show your own calculated risk exposure level as well as your very own income plan which we call turning a financial plan into a true\nRetirement plan no cost her obligation\nWe seen others offer this for over a thousand dollars or more and you know we could charge about two hundred dollars an hour for this but we're going to have it as a radio listeners to call right now you meet with me Marty Parker and the team will put together a plan for you that you can be confident that will take you all the way through retirement\nFinally someone is offering retirees and pre retirees common sense and straight talk instead of financial double talk in a retirement sales pitch folks you need to sit down and get a retirement written that put together\nAnd Paul Roberts who is coached Pete local trusted financial coach and the Biloxi area and his team will translate for you that complex financial world and it's a very clear instructions this is an excellent chance for you to get a true practical retirement review\nAnd for anyone listening right now the number to call the eight hundred eight nine one eighty six eighty when you call you will receive a comprehensive retirement review showing

experts are agreeing that the markets are overdue for a quote unquote correction now when we hear the word correction it sounds pretty harmless doesn't it [noise] well\nTo be honest it's about it's harmless as one geologist say that an area is overdue for a ... those quotes again seismic shift\nNow in plain English that means earthquake in that direction that the markets are overdue for well no one actually knows what that means until it happens that's why whether you're retired approaching retirement\nWork which is the real maybe you haven't even thought about it and now the time to get protection from that market volatility\nCalled power Roberts that eight hundred eight nine one eighty six eighty again that's eight hundred eighty nine one day eight year old\nEvery sound retirement
