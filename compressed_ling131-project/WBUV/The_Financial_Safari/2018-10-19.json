been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick

that Christ in cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so seems a lot of pick up in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time\nBut the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better at ... in a\nIn the polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had\nIt with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America stands and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite Sean I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek while I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen so if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated vets are coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nLet me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and
