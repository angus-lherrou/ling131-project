Caldwell pope is so much worse than he was the last year\nAnd the second thing is the Lakers aren't just bad defensively they are here darkly awful we're still very lovely to the middle of the most sports when they they are dead last so that's not a recipe but in a game against Denver which was a great comfort began went for the Lakers\nOnes of all had five deals in that game so if I were the Lakers right now here's what I Would do I would have brunch with Ingram coups ... ball and hard\nYour future why why am I wasting time with John Doe or Stephen you don't want to bring these veterans are like ... yeah and here's the deal around those effectiveness\nIs diminished coming off the bench because there was only there should be the guy to stand up to have that edge and its diminished when you're coming off the bat but now it's just you don't want to play with a guy Rondo who bit\nIn LeBron's best friend face it seemed Chris Paul is that they are and whatever their God parents each other's kids and Ron do even if he didn't spit in Chris Paul space I'm abroad and you're going to get in the face of my best friend how do you think you might Stevenson were brought in\nTo do the dirty work yeah that was wrong legitimacy that's fine but now with my best friend uh\nThere's there's value with rod though there's value with rod so you would start Rhonda over law that would have to finish the game yeah your lawn so going to say it was always your is your future why what do you plenty I'm On hold for\nHe ultimately is going to be the guy playing with the brunt of the ... let me ask you this are you going to sign a Rondo to a three year extension after no not at all then why are you starting him now keep 'em off the bench for because you don't want to throw away your investment after five games\nThing while he's in a Laker uniform use him to his best to\nDo is your future at this why you began not only wrong you know what I said why why can you understand what he says it I Would I mean I I'm not under any that I Want to hear you guys right now\nIf you're you're ... where are you God if you're the Lakers would you celebrate a gate with against the nuggets as a bit I mean I live out there and just feed it and I I Am aware of where screaming about the undefeated box hey five at all with the demolishing the timber\nWolves life by federal oven beatings Monday

the taste of something that you miss from the dung godly show\nHow how does how does analytics explained Clinton crochet can [noise] but the fact is that ... has been Clayton main [noise] he he's been like a five hundred pitcher in the postseason after being the most dominant regular season that you've ever seen [noise]\nNo I'm not telling you that there are other factors [noise] her shop in those years and when she fell apart against the cardinals in seven sending\nHe's pitching over two hundred and twenty and he's in the regular season he was carrying his team they wouldn't have been there without him [noise] the fact is that they don't really account for that the wear and tear and just pressure\nOf the season and then all of a sudden the post season and the weather kind of changes sure they have splits sure they have what you pitch in certain leather [noise]\nWhich you can't account for pressure of the moment combined with the tea combined with who is in the index circle combined with the the umpire who may or may not on a given day have a high or low strike zone I Know that there are some individual calculations factored altogether you don't have that [noise]\nThe Dodgers getting cute with who they're going to put in their line up on a given night [noise]\nShe just tells you that they [noise] the ...\nOh what the rest of us already figure Red Sox are the better team and the way they think they can win is by being sued by using some sort of numerical long range formula that holds the only one workout but doesn't play\nIn a seven game series [noise] I'm not telling you anything you didn't know but if you didn't know the red Sox are clearly better than the Dodgers the Dodgers having played well that doesn't seem to matter\nBecause the Dodgers are so tied to analytics said\nTo get the rest of your what Doug said ... searching the dung godly show as always you can hear that a godly show we dated three eastern new Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nLadies and gentlemen this is Dan Patrick show\nWhich quarterback ... do you think the brown to regret the most they passed on to Sean launches passed on Carson went and they passed\nOn chatty Bridgewater in their car that was twenty ... well I think I don't know if they regret that at the time we we had a story when they took me in jail that those two guys looked really good early Bridgewater didn't want to go to Cleveland and he said that when\nWe had him on the show he said thank God I they didn't draft you know I didn't want to go there [noise] uh Darren car I was told from somebody inside that they were taking their car and then all of a sudden they they passed on in the course in one so I think will be the the big ones [noise]\nChemical or is it an option that hey everything's okay we got Baker maybe as a fourth option they're fit it all worked out the way it should but I don't think you're going to get them to say you know what [noise] Baker Mayfield okay but boy certainly wouldn't be nice to have Carson winds here\n[laughter] Dan Patrick show oh man it's a fun we have nine am eastern six specific ... is the\nTime and time again about LeBron James being a Laker and he's just been completely supportive I kind of odd leave really doesn't want LeBron to see but you know what I'm starting to believe that he does\nThis is his place he was here for Twenty years I'd live around the fair I think he wants to liberal on the fly off\nYou are listening hitting a cell phone with Chris Broussard Enron Parker singled out that we see that seven pm eastern four pm switched it back\nOn TALK more\nThan ... show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] the giants in raiders have\nDecided by NFL standards we are going to take one of the things that would fall people bragged about said it was if they never male ... video you can have baseball teams give up to throw up the white flags in basketball teams do it but he says that's part of the ... fault DNA\n... nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nFox Sports friendly\nIn college football number two Clemson a fifty nine to ten winner at Florida State at Northwestern on Fox TV you got a home victory over number twenty Wisconsin thirty one Seventeen online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop price for through car\nSo here's one thing that I see\nAnd it's not easily shed however I Do think there are some things we can do here I Love the movie Moneyball and it's one of my favorite lines in a movie when Brad Pitt said adapt or die and baseball has by and large all adapted now they need to adapt to back\nThere is a problem analytics aren't fun\nAnalytics might be right analytics or mathematical therefore I can sit here and say oh my team is a better chance to win if I make this pitching move\nOr my ... my team has a better chance to win if I use my backup right fielder in this game there is a problem that's not what anybody wants to see it doesn't matter\nIf you might be right but in the end you're wrong because baseball at its core in the end what are we doing here Bucky this is an entertainment\nEntity that's what it is and so in game one of the world series features the Dodgers bench in their top for homerun hitters\nThat's positive analytics and its anti fan\nAnd you got to stop you have to stop I don't know how you deregulate analytics you got a third baseman standing in right field stopping base hits you gotta stop it's not fun I don't care if it's right I don't care if it's effective it's not fun and Bucky I think we sign up to be here for the fun\nI mean we certainly did sign up to be there for the fun of it is supposed to be about entertainment and I love\nLike strategy I Love the tactics that managers throughout a love seeing a manager's be able to put the imprint on games however\nYou are right the shifting um the thing that analytics have given um managers in terms of the way they can defend certain players it has taken some of the office of the game right near the defenses ahead of the office\nUm but I don't know how you can regulate it I don't know how you can say like oh there we were forbidding shifting those\nThings that's easy that's easy like in the in the NBA you've got a legal defense there's certain spots you can't stand hey third baseman you need to be All right surveys Harry [laughter] I Need to in filters on the left side of second base and he joined filters on the right side that's a real period\nWhat's wrong with that get rid of the shift it's killing it it's absolutely doing nothing for anybody\nIn the name it does nothing for anybody\nI mean it doesn't do anything from an office in\n... and water all bug can we talk about this every week water all sports doing they're making rules that are unfair to favor the off chance in the NBA teams are hitting a buck fifty every night right now\nI mean they are in the book fifty and how ... how many how much we're watching the games when the ... used to play when I was a kid and dug Mohammed them up and down this law right I mean they I mean buckets are just dropping like today I Do like to pick up that they are given\nBuckets and how many quarterbacks ever quarterback reading on a hundred in half the league is unbelievable okay so baseball\nHello [laughter]\nBut you're saying there's going to make a difference when it comes to the rating no but you do need to move you need all fenced\nYou need movement you need your support to move and I certainly don't want to spend I don't know I haven't even looked at this you guys know what's it costs to get into Dodger Stadium tonight what's the what's getting price I don't know what to do a couple of hundred bucks I has to be at least right\nOkay do state to say you're a what what's the what's interesting about the world series like it or see if I Want to go to the game tonight I'm a ... last night in upper level seats were over four hundred dollar okay I'm going to pay for\nThere are certain teams that resonate more than other teams you have the reason why are we talking about the Dallas Cowboys a lot there's a reason why we talked about the New England patriots than others\nUm just because they resonate there's a reason why we may not talked about the Detroit Lions because they don't necessarily draw a big number we are trying to make sure we give the people what they want the people's chance\nCome on man that's what we're doing here so uh what would make you watch more baseball age seven seven Ninety nine of us will keep going with your calls but bell flashy who are as I said just got home from Dodger Stadium moments ago\n[laughter] I just want to go yes he's panting and he's going to live in a moment but let's just have to say you're in here right now with the latest\nUh there is a lot of college football going on\nToday there is and Fox TV will have game for the world series tonight eight pm eastern by the way we do know the red Sox starter Eduardo Rodriguez he only through six pitches last night so he'll be starting and they didn't use ... at all so he could\nGo faithful to their national plenty of all the bad guy he's seven hundred pitches last night I mean my gosh and felt like he was pitching for six hours\nIt was phenomenal well close it was nearly a hundred pitches in relief Rick poor cello normally a starter through over sixty pitches in relief so we expect\nTo LA to enrich hill as the starter tonight and it is official Clayton cursed show all star game five tomorrow the red Sox don't need to overreact they don't need to pitch Chris Sale on short rest he can go tomorrow night there is still leading in the series by the way in the world series history\nGoing up two games to none sixteen of the last Seventeen of those teams went on to win the title Boston still won a hundred and eight games this year they still have five finalists for gold glove all three outfielders by the way you see with no da and the national league park they put JD Martinez in his or her ankle in left field at a couple of times the manager\nCame out of the dug out and said\nThere is a right handed poll hitter up can you not play left field and they switched the left and right field there is to try and keep him out of the equation of course the Dodgers as a team are betting to await this postseason so let's just keep that in mind reinforcing what we talked about last segment\nGame two of the world series the Dodgers only had three hits that game in Austin and all three were on the force ending so the rest of the game they were over twenty four and last night after the tense the Dodgers were to for twenty three\nI actually it's really last night I Would like to go for Halloween as a run scoring hit has anyone know where I was I went to a party city I was ... I Can't find one of those anywhere\nMan didn't the royals when a World Series very recently getting clutch singles they're just such thing in our college football top ten match up at Georgia is now bulldogs ten seven over Florida early second quarter on Fox TV eighth ranked Oklahoma sooner leads Seventeen nothing against Kansas State first and goal for K state early second quarter\nTop twenty match up Iowa leads at Penn State twelve seven early in the second\nIs that Missouri twelfth rank twelfth ranked Kentucky had three nothing leader at ... late in the first quarter and Houston ahead of number Twenty one South Florida fourteen to six in the second Houston all American defensive lineman at Oliver is out today with a bruised knee wins already for claims in northwestern back to you\nAll right excellent stuff through the same girl who was that the entire game last night and will be going to hide him as well um so yes there are still baseball fans in this world and then there are also people to work the games\nAre like Bill Cosby columnist LA Times were alive and the guy so far sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would Geico Geico dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven out only heard part figuring out which way it's easier when times get home last night but I\nGot home at four o'clock in the morning [laughter] and I'm back here at the ballpark and you know what [laughter] but it's you know what it was so worth it it was such a great now was it was a terrible don't\nMan aside this let's don't try to paint this as baseball so beautiful it's endless this time was it was excruciating\n[laughter]\nIt was ... it was horrific and you'll ... you'll know what I'm Talking about what\nDo we do now I mean this is what we've actually just been talking about is when you could have the Dodgers play the red sauce at Dodger Stadium in a World Series game three was so much on the line that's something so I think happened yet bill it's still not entertaining\nLike it was just telling you how to watch out an obligation not because you were like wow I Can't turn this off\nI talk I talk I talk to my girlfriend today to the stands and she said\nIt was like the same thing happen over and over and over again for Eighteen in it was unbelievable yes it was the same wherever you want to say it was it was not there was no entertainment value at all but there was but that will be could potentially lead to a huge entertainment value\nIf the Dodgers have trains you turn the whole ... woman round on this thing and the series is turn I think that's possible I think that's possible because the red Sox remember they were one out\nLittle kids are holds on to that ball they probably get often Barnes out they win that game the red Sox were went up and being up thrill and now they're pitch was decimated they're roughly two to one and they've got an above what potential go to second basic you know and uh you know and and the Dodgers were all fired up you know maybe we'll get one or two hits is diamond twenty\nAnd it's I don't know [laughter]\nYeah you're dealing in thinking about that so now going in the game for the pitching is all a mess because everyone can use the majority of their pitchers how does it affect both teams has effect the red Sox when it comes to their rotation how would that affect the Dodgers were\nWhat effect it affects the red Sox more because they use Nathan evolve he had the starting pitcher who pitched fix it fix any in relief pitchers so it it takes away whether it hurts hurts a lot more towards the Dodgers of doctors that ritual healthy ready\nTo go the red Sox don't really have a decent starter left at least for today the red Sox have gone through most of their book and the Dodgers have more long relievers down there is they have more aren't more and more innings left it affects your thoughts about one of the Dodgers Dodgers are seem to be on a much better path much more rested it all in all and all that this\nBill I Want to ask you about Dave Roberts because uh everybody in Los Angeles right now seems poised to pounce especially if they had lost last night there are two sides is a I don't even know what managers really do any more 'cause I don't trust them to decisions are coming from them\nBut secondly when it's he makes the world series two years in a row ... what are we talking about here like now so now everybody wanted to find them if you lost this Eighteen any game or he didn't now they want to keep him isn't it's stupid to have a decision come down to a few innings of baseball\nIt's really dumb and you saw the first thing you said was so right we don't know what he does they won't say it and I was closest with anybody and it's just hard\nTo understand that there were very secretive about exactly who does a lot they said it's a collaborative effort to line up they see all the moves they're collaborative or they did they take over the responsibility for what you're but you're right mark we don't know who does what so it's hard to judge you gotta just judges can he is the leader of men\nCan get them in a position to win any two straight World Series that's pretty damn good so I think you know I think there is no way they're going to fire him if they lose a series there's no way\nAnd ... and they're going to get rid of a contract with the more you're up there on contract it's going to be fine because again we don't like as soon as she's wanting to line up he'll take responsibility for it but we don't know if that's actually true everybody su he make all the changes he takes his responsibility for it we don't know if that scripted\nSo we just don't know with the with the whole analytics and with Andrew Freeman at Barnes eighty running the show here you just don't know so yes judge them\nNow he leads you've done a good job as a leader\n... he seems to be a gathering Dodger films don't get me started but then he started but then it seems like in the playoffs whenever the Dodgers have needed something he's come through ... was she well he's both ...\nHere's the thing the fans love him\nThe fans who this is the biggest disparity between what I've written in what I'm thinking what the fans thing\nI'd written issue trade them at the end of the year and I think they will try to the team and that's been fed up with his antics throughout the season all the good equals doesn't over way all the bad during the course of a sees all the distractions all the funny stuff but the fans just love him and ownership loves watching them\nSo it's a big disparity there'll be it but he has come through big but he's also you know made mistakes all the bases we played too shallow on that ball that Judy Martinez said that one of the game for the Boston it back in Boston you know he does he he he overthrew will cut off man and game on\nSo it just he it's kind of was that the sum total of his part is is entertaining player he makes a great place but does he always is it was at work is worth a distraction\nAnd I think they can probably get some form this winter it's the last year was contract going into I think you'll probably I think it will treat them the bands will be crazy and they'll be yelled at me and blaming me for it\nBut I and blamed the Dodgers I think it's probably the best thing\nOh my God what are they are they're warming up the Oregon already did I mainly what what are they doing all they give the Oregon is to break she was oh no no\nNo no no what happens is the topic than experiments after singer the inexperienced anthem singers come up here in practice before they happen with the organist either rural and that's what they're doing now so he must have an inexperienced person today maybe not some big movie star or something but yes so their their practice in the bathroom right now\nIt was weird though you know what they did the other we were in I think we're we're in Atlanta I Believe in the playoffs they actually there were ... in the stands and they came down and they practice the anthem on the field with fans in the stands like at six o'clock if they didn't know what to do so it's betting practice sitting around ... thereby kind of stands up\nTheir lives you know just a dress rehearsal about how [noise]", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city":
