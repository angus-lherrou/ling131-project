hundred forty five thousand dollars just to ...\nA jury found Mr Serbian guilty\nCurrently serving a one year and one day prison sentence Mr wearable pleaded guilty he'll be sentenced later this year\nAccording to the NRA the financial industry regulatory authority the panels found that this less than dynamic duo had to make James at Merck a lot of Indian state of his late wife five hundred Ninety five thousand dollars in compensatory damages two hundred and fifty thousand and punitive\nMight be a bit to collect those since we know is in prison and lost his job is home and he's currently working as an overdrive the take away here as always know who you're dealing with asking plenty of questions and make sure your broker is if the new year\nFor the financial safari news network said oh\nI kind of getting a\nLittle number two don't take advantage of I didn't move [laughter] I did have a a a cool over driver once and he would he turns out he was a prison guard full time at bar were butter Isabel Island Railroad and he basically new Bernie Madoff sure already was a hero inside the prison because you know bodies the guy and all the guys got hit by a\nRobot never learn sometimes they don't read the new trade well ... road\nSo I mean do you have to be careful about these pumping dumps to right oh yeah Mm let's talk about a couple of where buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket a strategy folks as it's just a way\nIt's not an end all be all but it's a way for you to divide mentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket nuts for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months the next\nWell we call we yell and read so it can be mixed it could be orange or can be read all the way it's it's your if your financial goals bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this book it should be at least one year that's yellow part\nAnd could be two five ten or Twenty years that's read part of getting and I'll say I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money and we used a one year time rising 'cause a lot of money goes tied to the market that's what we call it the risk and go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's why we have the number one so if you need the money you don't want to take money out of your your red account your bucket to if the market is down because you're walking into losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together makes sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's a bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and this one that a lot of people that are listening to listening now he said gosh we don't have a great book if he's got all her money or four one K. we've been told us our retirement yeah we don't have any safe options and there's really not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket\nBut there are ways of your fifty nine and older\nYou can roll out some of your money in four one K. and get into your own personal ice cream bucket or if you've left a job or two and you still have those for one case or give IRAs\nThese could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket and any funds that you'll say specifically\nTo provide income when you retire when of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under the yeah the ... percent federal penalty of ...\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what a lot of the accounts we see a nice the green book at our traditional raw step simple erase board when the spoils reduce the SPs they all are vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save in all those accounts I just mentioned we save their to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money\nAnd so you know with Murphy is always ... ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever like Kelly Brown got along well if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting that money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to be able to do you reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happens to retire ouch now you're gonna do forty percent less things probably sixty percent less thing because now you're worried and retirement and wanted to do\nYou're basically going to sit home and sit on the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day you know that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes yeah and so it's not as much as you can take so again that's this is why we call it a bucket ballots you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're in the four one K. it's all when the risk bucket there's no say well the safe option gives you a one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year or you're losing money safely\nI Know is that the bank it's in the CD and you're all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we have inflation growing by three percent and you're only already one percent you're buying power shrinking revenues financial evaporation we can't have\nAnd the successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and beyond\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but Atlanta go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next again that's how it through planned is that the truth but if the plan and it has all three buckets to read the green together buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this call right now we'll put together your very own customized\nBus getting strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper bucking strategy has these three items and these three out of the most important items at any financial or retirement plan gross\nMaking sure the potential growth ... years you have the money they're protection protecting your money from taxes protecting get as much as you can from Texas protecting from risk these commissions\nVery important protection just like a quarterback has an office of wind you didn't office of wine or on your portfolio and then income for the rest of your life with no questions consist of persistent reliable income\nWhen you decide to take it for the rest of your life no questions asked and hopefully that you have a couple of other green buckets one two three you'll have increasing and come away through retirement we can set that up where you are with the next ... two hundred thousand there'll be no cost her obligation and you'll get that financial education and personalized bucket of strategy that you deserve Steve do how to do that\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nJust limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show those include inflation Social Security healthcare emergencies so many things the stock market volatility risk taxation but here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime\nRetirement income plan that's right folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account now the number to
