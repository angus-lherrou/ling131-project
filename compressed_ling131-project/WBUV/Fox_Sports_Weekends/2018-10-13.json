{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "To somebody who specializes in kicking right through retirement there you go through and so they have the fastest sprinter it had to to to get to that point but when you get to retirement you need a marathon runner make fun of something and so a lot of people don't have\nThat so we need to have that yearly paycheck and I for one day and it's not offered so how do we do it while we roll the money tax free into our own retirement plan and we built a yearly income component into their ... and if we build it right we have lifetime income for the rest of our life we can have increasing income if we use the marketing strategy\nAnd we can also have some of that money dedicated for long term care while\nAnd if we include that into a total retirement plan we can also have something called a super will transfer so that when you pass away your children will get a tax free or your spouse will get a tax free income for the rest of your life instead of taxable and we can do something called a spending leaf plan\nWhere if you're worried about wanting to leave money to the ... what if you could spend all the money you want it to today or this year or in your lifetime short and when you pass away your children or whatever whoever your grandchildren you're leaving the money to\nGet exactly or more than what you started with oh probably spent it and now you're leaving okay well that are a lot of people haven't had heard of the snow and then and then when people see it actually in writing which it all was in writing they are in disbelief number one\nThe main disbelief is not that is true because it's all backed up right twenty five years in the financial never had a complaint I mean I I'm not just say and stuff so to say thanks short of disbelief because the current plan or never told them about it and the main reason unfortunately\nAnd I have to apologize for the financial industry for this is that many advisors are compensated by keeping you at risk ... ... if you're going to a doctor and he was describing your prescription it had nothing to do with what you needed it made it may be made you to press instead of happy\nAnd you went to the doctor and say why were you prescribe and as for years to me and he said well compensated by the drug companies six to keep you on drugs I wouldn't be surprised well that's about it what we're talking about here if someone's got you in the wrong place financially and it's not helping you a matter of fact is hurting you 'cause you're not building an income plan why they doing it\nWell it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... really search out and find folks who are you've mentioned fiduciary in the past how important it is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interest 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income plan and here's what you hear\n[noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older and I started before it was the cause I'm In this financial arena and I want\nTo make sure the bill myself retirement plans I was called back of the day when they the ... channel did a biography about me it's appeared on about our show when everything oh well they called me the Mike you the financial world because I Try everything before I recommended any but okay and so maybe the life sort of commercial may and so if\nI'm like a human guinea pig here vote in tests rapid and Peter Rabbit right so what else what I'll do though was not talk about something on the air unless I really believe in it and\nWe unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning\nMany people are ignoring that\nAnd they're hoping that everything would just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but not only you but for your spouse and if he passed away two so which anytime you best ways to sue we wanted we call it taken the limousine they haven't right that's right but when that happens\nYou want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it go onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and going someone else's pocket and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that planned built then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with if you want yeah but what you know what people usually tell me if we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put more in it [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand at a Scott trade account or something like that okay and buy and sell some stocks on their own or whatever just keeps your mind sharp yeah yeah yeah and it keeps them you know happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still have okay they still have the more they're young they're important for the rock is they haven't rock is there is going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and that's the way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years I see people who thought they were fine\nUntil the market rip the carpet out from under him\nAnd then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like taking an ant hill over there you know it's come back and rebuild but all the time that could have been building a palace precisely it high but how are you there having to start over again and that's what happens starting over again is not any fun now and\nEspecially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you already have the income you need for retired so you already have the money that could get you didn't come you need a retirement but your current winner hadn't told you about ... so if you're one of the next twenty callers as we leave for the week here keeping my folks

the goal in mind\nI mean when you hear me neither I frankly claims playing ability we want to thoroughly review and offering more specific details\nOn companies withdrawing\nDeferred annuities are shall we\nFrom the mental us GMC studios here talk going on for nine\nPoint and I heard a radio station [noise]\nFox Sports trending\nGame two of the NFL Championship series about to start on Fox TV today Dodgers that Milwaukee Brewers took the open or the best to seven last night at home Milwaukee is one twelve straight games the ALCOA starts this evening with Houston at Boston in college football Baylor has a seven three lead at ninth ranked Texas late in the first quarter\nThey lost six football games that is unacceptable out of breath like taxes and their word Texas fans going huh did this not work either well how do you like me now\nAnd I'm now in screaming out from the beginning now Tom\nHarm in in a year where coming in wasn't even expecting to do this this quickly Tom Hartmann is in the top ten and as Texas in position to potentially if things go perfectly the rest of the way this guy could end up in the college football playoff this year that's what happens if you just have a mental patients\nBut when we're not in that business now well I don't want we shouldn't be they actually in that kind of high price environment I think\nYou have to be can't give out contract like that and they lied on them all six weeks later\nOnly if the world we live by mark Willard standards to be honest with you we being a great place however how many coaches are sitting on their college right now at home eating chips and guacamole with Shaq getting mailbox money checks that are coming they don't have to do anything about\nThis is on the Lakers ended up paying for three four or five I don't do drugs are paying some well they are they're still paying some coaches and watch how the Luke Walton thing\nOff suddenly works because what Brian James is on his roster that is what it was all along you could blame the coach this that and the other at the end of the day sports comes down to players now you could have a bad coach mess up good players\nAnd you then you can have a really good coach get some more out of players that maybe aren't up to snuff but really when it all boils down to it you know yeah it's like you said the chefs got to have the food and they've got to have the ingredient\nI don't fully but clearly let's just yes players matter the but as for the period there I'm with you on that but I Do think there's more to organizational strength and success than just simply we have good play no of course because this is why\nBob Kraft great honor Bill Belichick great coach and GM and then\nObviously we have a great players and it's ... you know Julie I Would say he's good I Would say is great but you know we've got some good players in some\nGreat players are on both sides of the ball and now all of a sudden what happens you get guys who go to their they have to buy into the system that the minds of the way they practice the meticulous way their approach to the game and I think that that's why guys go there and it's to see that's why Lugar blocking go there and win a championship in guys come in you know who's who's who's white oh there was a\nRunning back and he's avid you can have success because of that I think that's why guys the year and year out the ... the spurs drafted guy you go\nIn there always good to a drive in the back end of the first round if not the second round and then the next thing you know there's some I'm not saying all great but there's solid places they always let them for a while I'm with you that players\nHave you have good players I still think having a good coach at a good organization you create some type similar of a you know a ... organization that this is where principles this is the the the allies we when\nYou're right you're right but how many NBA coaches because the warriors\nBut then that goes to my point yeah that the organizational sexual exactly what I Want we want and cyber player we want this type of guy we want position let's players and\nLook at what we're we're going to allow the courage to do things what Steve Kerr do I allow the players is that even allowed in the coach right so there's a cult like literally when you go there don't you just want to almost rabid movie\nAnd just be like well the culture is just ... I think a lot of people do I'm sure that I think a lot of people do the job it's a I don't even know I said they don't you don't have to land on the planet ... like a ... so not my point is\nYes anybody could culture they have the players why did they get the players that the players are referring to were drafted most other great organization\nUm yes yes that's absolutely for art Adam ... on the NFL in Fifteen minutes but coming up next it was a common that just kind of slid under the radar on Thursday Night Football but I thought it was one of the most important\nComments any NFL announcer has made this year that's nuts\nCollege football\nHis way in in the end for\n... when it comes to the LA football coverage on your radio\nMoney besides\nIt's it's Fox Sports radio which is building a better bank look like it starts with building\nCapital one cafe warm inviting places feel nothing like a typical bank\nWhere you can open an account with no fees are minimum in five minutes and you'll always find people ready to help you not sell you welcome the banking reimagining what's in your wallet\nFor consumers only offered by capital one and a member FDIC copies available in select locations copyright twenty eight and capital one [noise]\nIndeed knows finding the right higher takes time away from your business hiring unqualified did engineered felt like a second job more job seekers indeed than any other site so there's no better place to find someone with the skills you're looking for I needed someone with a masters in computer science and database experience\nPlus indeed screener questions help you find your shortlist fast now I'm back to having just one job even more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire post your job and the dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site ... if\nYou suffer from E.

today gentlemen or one nothing victory at Armenia\nMaybe the bad news is when they play those national anthems before the game the er people up in the press boosted Armenia they played the Lichtenstein national [laughter] so why are wrong small country\nBut nice try just what I'm trying to enjoy my victory you paid early player on\nSomething that I tell you what they're just add some controversies in every country okay we're alive and the guy on Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance of Geico guy cannot calm eight or nine four seven out on the hard part figured out which way it's easier serious XM NFL insider\nItem Kaplan now joins us live follow him on Twitter at Kaplan NFL out of it is great to have you know what I'm thinking about this New York giants quarterback situation\nAnd what's the answer a white guy and when you see something this early in the season how how do they even how do they get out of this what are what are they going to do going forward\nThere's not much because the only option would be to turn to work you call a letter\nOr who's a fourth from pick who I thought the ... who really put himself with a map I don't know if he would have even been drafted and they don't have that great scene about weight but it really opened my eyes were on the national football league getting really help himself\nThroughout the drip process but he he's in he's in an active so you'd have to do what you gotta start getting him number two apps and eventually get them number one there there are ways away from doing that\nSo I looked at the giants you saw two weeks ago that crushing loss or to the Panthers on the road game if they blow their mostly we're not there they were just not ready against the eagles and the ... of it uh the Superbowl champs put them away and put them away early\nAnd ... and here's the thing remember they cut they was whether it was the third round pick a couple of years ago so they didn't think he was the answer to this point if you're the giants\nYou're gonna have to draft that guy next year now Herbert the the argue quarterback cocker personnel people is by far the best available quarterback assuming he enters the draft and if ... if the team that has the first pick overall needs a quarterback right now guys that they would take him\nYou know what am I Want to talk about these two two and one teams there's of course the Vikings you got the browns or got Pittsburgh and a missing one more uh but there there are there is Green Bay\nSo out of these teams who was the team that you can say I this was a strange you know five games with them but they look good going the rest of the way\nWell that's a great way to ... to\nForm that question because some things have happened this year it I wasn't expecting 'cause I didn't expect the Vikings to struggle like they weren't out last week in Philly they were phenomenal cut costs it's probably\nOne of the best case for a quarterback I've ever see alive ... being at that game I was blown away with some of those that he's made and uh they're they're doing a great job of managing him he's having a great season so far by the way it's their defense it's surprisingly not played as well as we we thought\nThat the team of the group\nOf of the under achievers that I think will be better now the eagles are three and three they're going to win that he had a feast\nOr they get me out I think the Vikings ... the two to one team's so funny we are talking about that records like who would have believed\nAs much so it was a stranger and yeah it's\nCrazy I mean it's it's it's you know particular that these ties it's it's insane and the browns almost that two of them but the bottom line is I think the light of that group I think that's the one team of the two to one teams that writes itself it gets in the playoffs\nAdam Joplin with us out and we're going to get a look at the first start of the year for game is Winston tomorrow interested to see how that goes but in general where would you say the status stand in terms of Seamus as the long term\nThey're in Tampa Bay\nYeah I don't think that right now he could ... anyone could say that he definitely is because of the off the field concerns it has up at performance situation though I think at times it's been a consistent\nOr this to me is that for him I mean he's got to get 'em ... knowledge you have to stay out of trouble or know that could be no issues off the field he's got to play a really good football here all of the defense is better challenge that it did last year the defense is not play at the level that it needs to he doesn't have to run against poured it they're great at wide receiver off it was actually pretty good\nI think gave us tomorrow at Atlanta it starts there are many this is a game where the falcons effect to struggle mightily with other injuries this\nWas a game regime is has to get himself together here in the rye fitzpatrick they took the job from him in early joining the lose it but they want to go back to James let him get the job back up but to answer a question in the end I don't know that he's the franchise quarterback anymore I think he's got a proof of self and it starts tomorrow in Atlanta\nI Want to stay in the same division they had the Panthers no they're franchise quarterback and uh that is of course can do and his favorite receiver and target maybe ... how good are they are they under the radar as it's just what they simply do and how big is it going to be able to get ... back for this office\nYeah guys they play at the Redskins to march you must really offer they got blown out of it at all at once we saw that they got the they were embarrassed by that gave me would sit there would be bouncing back at home with Caroline is one of these teams they play good defense anywhere they got that portable game plan you know they're going to come in running the football with McCaffrey has shown that\nHe could handle high volume of cars which we didn't know he could come into the season was north charter um\nTherefore I don't remember the coming off there by a they got Curtis have all their outstanding young receiver they absolutely love they're they're actually deepened passive targets Greg also look really good I'm told a practice this week\nUh they just have to make a final decision there but it looks like he's going to play barring a step back\nUm and we don't play this is definitely the next week give us a barn set back remember he report the same for the book last year and it grabs a guy that's got a great future and TV I remember when I was an ESPN with him\nWatching him work this guy is their their suppliers who who come off the field of go into the booth that's one guy Greg Olson the path or study and who absolutely will be able to do it\nOut I'm real quick thing is you are you made reference earlier to who could have seen all these ties coming and I'm thinking now that I've watched that ten minute clock in the overtime we should've known like there have been a bunch of other games that were really close and we're going to keep seeing that if they keep that ten minute clock are they going to get rid of that", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "13"}
