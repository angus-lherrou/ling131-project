Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nAnd then the holy Bible says this and John one one three five and then first fourteen in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God\nHe was in the beginning with God all things came into being through Hamad apart from him nothing came into being that has come into being in him was why for the life was the light of men the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it and the word became flash\nAnd wealth among us and we saw his glory glory as are the only gotten from the father full of grace and truth and he wrote again John\nRoad again in first John ... won three for what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes would have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life\nIn the life was manifested in we have seen and testify and proclaimed to give the eternal life which was with the father and was manifested to us what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also so that you two may have fellowship with us\nAnd indeed our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ\nThese things we right so that our joy maybe made complete\nSo the only question that really matters is who is Jesus an answering that question correctly is critical to one's eternal destiny heaven is the result of getting the the right answer and the right response to that question\nAnd eternity and the devils hell as a result of not answering that question correctly\nSo this is not simply an issue that affects your belief in this life is not simply an issue that affects your lifestyle here on earth no who Jesus is is the preeminent issue of olive life and it will affect your eternal destiny\nMust understand that all humans who live on this planet are accountable to God for the answer to this one question even if they don't know the answer they are accountable to God for the answer\nBut the wrong answer or no answer at all dams them forever and the right answer opens the door to eternal life enjoy so this is the question of all questions\nAnd all through the centuries of man's existence philosophers have offered answers to this questions and theologians have offered answers and false profits and false religions have given their answers and secularists have given their answers and atheists have given their answers and human is given their answers and sadly\nTheir answers are all wrong all of them are wrong every single one of them are wrong about the single most important question of all\nWho is Jesus\nAnd you would think that right off the bat that question a serious and as important as this one\nWould be very complex and very complicated and very detailed and involve many aspects and much analysis and much research in much study you would think that it would be very difficult to answer a question like this since there are endless books and endless articles and\nEndless discussions and treatments on the question of the identity of Jesus Christ\nLibraries are full literally of tens of thousands if not millions of books that have been focused on addressing this one question in one way or another articles appearing journals magazines and newspapers discussions are held symposiums are assembled every here\nThe level of assault on the issue of the identity of Jesus Christ might convince us that this is a very complex and difficult question that cannot be answered easily\nIn fact the consensus might indicate to us that it really doesn't have an answer that it's just something you sort of work on with no hope of resolution millions and millions of pages exist giving testimony to what some would conclude is the author and possibility of coming to the right conclusion about this issue\nBut the fact of the matter is their friends that this was a very easy question to answer it only becomes hard if you reject the Bible so all of these people who bring their hands over who Jesus is are only doing that because they refuse to believe the Bible to be the word of the living God\nWhat is absolutely astounding just to see the arrogance and self righteousness of these people is it will very quickly and very easily favor their own rational thinking and their own intellect and their own very limited personal experiences over the clear an unmistakable testimony of sacred scripture\nOthers will stay there eternity on the confusing and contradictory in historically inaccurate testimony of discredited false profits and teachers who fabricated spurious information that can be very easily put down\nThe bottom line is that if you do not accept what the Bible says about who Jesus is that your hopelessly lost in your search for the real Jesus\nIn fact are for gospel records Matthew mark Luke and John answered the question of who Jesus is over and over and over again\nIn fact John wrote in John twenty versus thirty and thirty one the very purpose for why he wrote\nThe gospel record when he said there for many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written this book but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God and then be leaving you may have life and his name\nSo Jesus Christ the son of God and back in the first century when somebody said that somebody was a son of\nThen that was that ... that he had the very same nature substance or essence as his father and the Jesus has the very same nature or substance or essence as God then Jesus is God in human flesh dislike the Bible says that he is\nAnd so if you put your trust in Jesus and in his finished work you will be forgiven for all of your sins and you will spend eternity in heaven\nAnd if you do not then you keep your ... and you will have to pay for all of them yourself in hell\nSo that's the Jesus is and that's what comes by believing in him and that's not ambiguous than it is an hidden or obscure it does it take some kind of academic degree to sort out it is very clear it is very simple it is very precise very straightforward and it is very very important\nNow we're in a journey through the gospel account of Dr Lu who wrote this book and the book with the axe to a Roman dignitaries name the awful is to convince him of the veracity of Jesus being the along the way the Jewish Messiah and the savior of the world at some point around a de sixty\nWhich was approximately thirty one years after the resurrection about four years after Paul wrote the book of Romans and about ten years before the Roman army destroyed the temple in Jerusalem and with it a little bit nickel priesthood and all of Judaism\nAs we've already discussed ... was a medical professional in a very detailed historian and theologian who probably under the apple stock authority of the apostle Paul wrote this to volume work Luke engaged in very lengthy interviews with the people and the witnesses involved in all of this including marry the mother of the lord\nAnd so front and center and looks account of the birth of life and ministry and death resurrection\nOf Jesus Christ there's absolutely no way that any honest reader can avoid the repeated identification of Jesus as being God Almighty inhuman flash fully divine and fully human in the very same body at the very same time without any conflict are contradiction\nIn chapter one you have the testimony of an angel as to the coming of the messiah who was the Lord Jesus Christ you also have the testimony of an Old Testament praised\nBy the name of Zacharias to the fact that he will be the father of a child John the Baptist that would be the Fort runner of the messiah who would come to fulfill all the promises of the old covenant and ... you have to collect the testimony of angels that the cars child has been born and then he was born in Bethlehem and that his name is Jesus\nAnd then in the same chapter to you have the testimonials too Old Testament Jewish saints\nBy the name of sent me an Anna who testified that the baby Jesus is indeed the promise messiah who was come to fulfill Old Testament prophecy and be the savior centers\nAlso in chapter two at the end of the chapter you of the testimony of Jesus himself who at the age of twelve is engaged in deep profound theological discussions in the temple confesses that he needs to be about his heavily father's business since this earthly father was a builder and a carpenter\nChapter three we have the testimony of John the Baptist the fiery\nForeigner of the messiah who identifies Jesus as being the lamb of God he was come to take away the sins of the world\nChapter three again Jesus was baptized by John and that his baptism you have the testimony of the Holy Spirit the third person at the trinity the dissent zone Jesus as baptism and the very same way that a dove descends from his flight to the earth\nAnd you have John testified that he saw the spirit of God come upon Jesus and remain which had never happened to anyone before this time and not all gave divine affirmation to him and then you have the very audible and verbal testimony of the father himself\nOf who speaks out of heaven and says this is my beloved son in whom I Am well pleased\nAnd that map of course that Jesus was sent lists that he was perfect and that he plays the father in every way thought word indeed twenty four hours every day and seven days every week and then you have in chapter for the testimony of Satan who comes to tempt Jesus and says to him since you are the son of God\nDoesn't even in the midst of this amazing temptation state never doubted who Jesus was\nAlso in chapter for further down the testimony of other fallen angels who we know now or demons who identified Jesus as the holy wanna guard or the son of God and then you have the testimony of Peter ... who says depart from me oh lord", "station": "WBUV",
