on justice Hank winds them Fox News\nFrom the men do Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\nWelcome to the company piece radio broadcast the teaching ministry of pastor ... Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nAnd John makes the amazing claim here that what Jesus told them the apostles wrote down\nAnd they wrote it all down so that they could proclaimed to us so that we would be safe than half true fellowship with the father and with the other apostles\nBecause John says here inverse strings that the apostles absolutely do have a correct fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ and the amazing statement that John makes here in verse three is if any of us ever plan on having a true incorrect fellowship with God if\nAny of us plans on being say that we must have a true incorrect fellowship with the apostles because John says here that the fellowship that the apostles have with the lord is true and correct\nAnd what that means to us it that there is no such thing as anybody having a true incorrect fellowship with Jesus Christ without also having a true incorrect fellowship with the apostles and what the apostles wrote in the Bible\nIn other words there is no such thing as anybody being outside of fellowship with the apostles and what they taught in the New Testament and yet having a true incorrect fellowship with Jesus Christ\nAnother way of saying this is that if we're walking in contradiction to what the apostle John and the other apostles taught in the twenty seven books of the new covering it than we must know that we do not have a true or correct fellowship with Jesus Christ\nAnd get another way of saying this is it one of the ways we know that we are said is to walk or live our lives in such a way as the apostle John rights here in this a pistol that if we are living contracts\nTo the way that John rights here or elsewhere in the sixty six books the holy Bible then we should be very concerned about whether we are saved and not simply deceived\nAnd looking at first John chapter one first for John said these things we ride so that our joy may be made complete\nJohn says that he writes the things contained in this episode for one reason one purpose that are joy may be may complete and that means that everything in this episode is designed to do one thing to produce in us the fullness of joy\nAnother way of saying this is it the overriding response to us being truly saved is joy\nJohn wants us to actually enjoy our salvation and thrive at being said and relish the new birth and the straight and narrow path\nAnd delight ourselves in the lord and the way that John intends for us to enjoy our salvation is to give us these ten test that you find in the ... so that we will not be deceived and simply think where said\nSo we can enter into this amazing joy so that the power of sand may be broken over our lives and we may be set free from our sinful natures and be born again and live our lives with abandon in this radical uh that Jesus gave to us all to the glory of God\nAnd look again at first John one first fine this is the message we have heard from him and announced to you that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all\nThis is the powerful radical life changing message that we have heard from Jesus personally and then we apostles John said wrote down in the pages of the New Testament that God is white and in God there is no dark and said oh\nGod it's like God is pure goddess endless God is pristine God is holy God is righteous\nGod is perfect God is the highest form of morality God is the highest expression\nObscurity got is the highest degree of love God is the highest form of living there is no world system no morality no way to live that even remotely measures up to the level of God's own personal character in nature\nThe perfect standard is not anything that man has developed but the perfect standard against which all of their standards are measured is God's own personal character in nature\nAnd God will judge and hold accountable all men against that standard which is against himself not other people\nJohn says there is no darkness of any sort in God none and that is very important statement because John then goes into five chapters to tell us exactly what that means\nJohn then explains it because God is why it has no darkness inhibit all their for every soul that it's in Jesus every soldier who was truly save every soldier who has truly been born again\nHas that very same nature inside of him as well\nLook what John first John one sick says if we say that we have fellowship with him Jesus Christ and yet walk in the darkness\nWe lie and do not practiced the truth\nThe apostle John and the other apostles understood something that we all need to try to grasp in our day because we're flash because we live in this world because our feelings are as follows are flash because our hearts or deceptively wicked because we are limited in our understanding and our knowledge is finite because we're human\nBecause we are not God we have an enormous capacity to be deceived about ourselves it is possible for humans to be very happy and very content\nAnd yet living Raul CNN and not be convicted are concerned about it in the least it is possible for people to be in blatant rebellion to God and not be worried about it it is possible for people to be standing on the very edge of eternal damnation and not even be moved\nAnd that means that no one is the best judge about himself no one is able to see himself as clearly as he needs to no one has the capacity to understand his own heart or his own motives\nSo since that is true God in his great mercy has given us several things that will help us to see ourselves fully incorrectly\nAnd the correct way to see ourselves as to see ourselves as God sees us and that is to see the truth about ourselves\nFor God has given to every single saved person these means these gifts\nTo help us to see ourselves he's given us the word of God\nThe holy Bible the scriptures he's given us the enrolling Holy Spirit who authored it responds and agrees with the Bible he's given us the church made up of imperfect people all striving to love Jesus through obedience and helping one another by holding each other accountable to the word of God in provoking one another to love and the good works\nBy proclaiming and teaching the word through the power the Holy Spirit he's given us prayer\nWhich brings us into God's presence in resets are bearings from being caught away by the world in the flesh and the devil he's given this times of godly fellowship with other believers and he's given us gifts slight communion and baptism which reminds us of what it took for us to be said and reminds us of our capacity to see an\nEnd of the great price that set us free\nGod gave us all these things so that by a failing our sales of them we would be strong in the lord and in the power of his mind and we would see ourselves as God sees us so that we will not be deceived about ourselves and actually be truly saved\nAnd here's why reverse six again if we say that we have fellowship with him and you walk in the dark as we lie and do not practiced the truth\nTrue salvation is not about simply praying a prayer and walking down in our raising your hand or being baptize are joining the church are adopting some moral code to live by no\nTrue salvation as a supernatural miracle were by God the Holy Spirit actually and literally comes to us while we are yet in our sins and while we are yet last and while we are doing as much as we can to serve Satan\nAnd to rebel against God and to run and hide from God and while we are not wanting this while we don't care anything at all about God while we're wishing that God would just leave us alone God the Holy Spirit comes at that moment\nTo us before we ask him to before we desire him too before we initiate anything at all towards him\nGod the Holy Spirit sovereign leave violates our will\nHe sovereign Lee interrupts our lives he's sovereign Lee inserts themselves\nInside of us he's sovereign Lee imposes himself on to us he forcefully opens are blind dies he gives us new eyes that see he forcefully an stops are deaf ears and allows us to hear\nHe forcefully goes inside of us and takes out of us as stony heart and he puts in place of that stony heart heart a flash that is able and willing to believe\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself without any cooperation from us at all gives us new spiritual life he read births us he regenerate sauce he destroys forever the domination that sand had over us\nAnd he kills and take out of us forever that fall and sinful and rebellious nature that we inherited from from Adam\nAnd God the Holy Spirit all by himself gives us a new nature\nA nature that is divine nature that naturally normally loves God and the things of God a nature that craves the presence of God a nature of the hunger and thirst after righteousness anew nature that six to God's will\nAnd nature that enjoys following after God a new nature there relishes the way of God a new nature that hunger for truth anew nature that desire to understand God's word\nIn the very same way that a baby desires to suck milk anew nature that thrives on the straight and narrow path\nA new nature that hates seeing in a new nature that naturally and normally loves the commandments of God\nGod sovereign Lee super naturally miraculously and forcefully takes us out of the kingdom of darkness and brings us into the marvelous kingdom of God in his lovely Christ and we changed we are now transformed we are now a new creation", "city": "Moss Point"}
