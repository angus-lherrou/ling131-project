Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one verse at a time\nWhich we saw last time and versus ten three Seventeen this emits miracle of feeding the crowd is quantitative laid the largest miracle Jesus ever did\nIn the same time on the same day he's teaching and he's healing people and we also know that he was casting out demons as part of this so all of this explosion of miracles is going on on this particular day in addition to the singular miracle of this massive creating a food for Fifteen to twenty five thousand people\nAnd this is the culmination of Jesus his entire Galloway in ministry and it is that that combination that Luke transitions into this powerful and vital confession of faith\nSo this is a perfect time for a loop to say all of the evidence all of the proof all of the testimony is all the confirming signs and wanders then examined and there's nothing more that is needed to be proven about Jesus he is God Almighty and human flesh\nAnd based on all of this Jesus confronts the apostles with this amazing question who do people say\nAm and they gave him all the answers that unbelievers had developed about Jesus but then changed this gets very personal and he asked the apostles but who do you say that I Am\nAnd God the father sovereign look reveals to the apostles with Peter is the spokesman the one and only correct answer inverse twenty the Christ of God\nAnd so with this divine revelation the apostles have completed their theological education this is the final exam and they all made a perfect score they got this one right and this is still true for us today you might think you know the Bible and you might know history and you might have a lot of common sense\nBut if you don't know this one single answer he will never see haven't\nOnly those who know who Jesus is will enter into having now\nI Need to tell you though however that this that that that do in the flow of looks gospel this goes from the feeding the crowd directly to this question to the disciple these advanced don't follow each other chronologically\nThis moment with this question actually occurred later in time because there's an intervening period here in which Jesus went to the area of tire inside and and when she came back across the northern part of ... down into the eastern section known as the capital is\nWhich is a gentle area of about ten cities and he performed several miracles there and that means there were other things going on in between these events of the feeding of the twenty five thousand people and asking this question of who he was\nBut this was the culmination of his ministry in galley because tire inside and they're gentile territories into capitalist was outside galley\nAnd Jesus moves down towards ... where he is captured in tried and finally executed where he can be raised from the dead so\nThis moment here in ... nine is the culmination of his gallery and ministry and so evidently it seemed appropriate place for Dr Luke to bring in this divine confession by the apostles even though it actually occurred at a later time\nNow again to study this divinely revealed confession about who Jesus is much deeper I Would point to you that Sunday evening Bible as Matthew sixteen where I did a very in depth exit Jesus of this entire moment that I Believe I have copies of on the table in the back of the church\nAnd people always ask me why did ... did this why did he put advance out of their chronological order in his gospel record does this mean that something is wrong with the Bible\nWill no there's nothing wrong with the Bible Jesus actually did say these words but we have to understand that has got the Holy Spirit was moving upon Dr Luke to write this large gospel record the Holy Spirit inspired him to do it in this particular order\nSo this was not a mistake or an error or even a type of graphical mistake Dr Luke is writing at the moving of the spirit of God's who is superintendent this entire work of inspiration and an air and sea\nAnd all that was said at this moment is recorded elsewhere in great detail and so God the Holy Spirit chooses not to repeat every word in their fullest detail here and looks account he chooses the you moved\nTo the next event in the flow of looks emphasis and I think it is probably likely that one of the factors which caused Dr ... to do this is that he was already pressing the limits of a single scroll to contain everything that he wrote about the birth life ministry teaching death and resurrection and the ascension of Jesus\nRemembered that looks account is the longest gospel record it has the most words in it and it does press the capability of a single scroll to handle it all\nSo getting it all on one screw it would make it much more easily acceptable to the gym towel world which would not be helped by putting everything in this is why we have for gospel records we must know that look has events and statements in his record that the other three do not have\nSalute quote as he was moved along by God the Holy Spirit in while absolutely accurate his record is not the only one that we need to read\nAnd that is why at the end of his gospel record the apostle John makes this important comment there are many other things that Jesus did which if they were written in detail I supposed that even the world itself would not contained the books that were written\nThere were so many incredible stories so many incredible testimonies so many amazing miracles and all the stories that were surrounding those miracles than all the books of the world could not contain them all [noise]\nSo what you have all the gospel wreck records is a selection of all those true event say selection that each of the gospel riders material founded Matthew in mark was left out and some of the material that they left out ... put in\nSo it is important to know that the for gospel records do not in any way contradict one another they complement one another and between all four we get is full and as complete a picture is that is possible\nAnd just the same with the way the Holy Spirit is flowing I'm Dr look back and chapter eight versus twenty five ... begins moving toward\nThis compelling question of who Jesus is after Jesus it's still the storm on the sea of got only he asked where's your faith and Luke rights and they were fearful and amazed saying to one another who then is this that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him\nAnd so here look introduces us to this question and we're being forced to answer the question who is this man\nWe've already heard the testimony of an angel and the whole host of haven't we've heard the testimony of Zacharias we've heard the testimony of ... in simian we've heard the testimony of Satan\nWe've heard the testimony of demons we've heard Jesus his own confession about himself we've already heard and read all of that along with all of the confirming signs and wanders in miracles and now comes the time to really nail this issue down\nSo we look eight verse twenty five he begins to surface the question who is this man in his chapter nine begins\nIt comes from wicked king Herod haired said inverse nine I myself had John beheaded but who is this man about who might hear such things\nSo we are being led to this question that has got to be answered and then inverse Eighteen we see that Jesus was praying alone and he comes to the disciples any questions them saying who did the multitude say that I Am\nAnd finally inverse twenty Jesus Says okay that is what others say about me but who do you say that I Am and now we get the only correct answer the Christ of God\nDr Luke wanting to come straight to the answer to this question because as far as salvation is concerned and where we're going to spend eternity this is the only question that mattered back then\nAnd this is the only question that matters today as far as salvation goes if you do not know who Jesus is correctly nothing else matters your last so the only question that really matters is who is Jesus\nNow all that I said so far is my introduction and even though I'm not going to finish this today I can now start to do my ex position of preaching about the passage that is before so let's look again at verse Eighteen\nLuke wrote and it happened while he was praying alone the disciples were with him and he questioned them saying who did the people say that I Am\nI noticed that look begins the section by saying and it happened or came about and both are grammatically correct from the original Greek\nAnd the way he says this indicates to us that there has been a transition from what just finished inverse Seventeen to what is about to happen now\nAnd we know from the other gospel riders than actuality there's been a very linked the trends that transition of several weeks if not months in which Jesus has gone to tire inside and then down to the capital is before this moment arrives so verse Eighteen occurs after that sequence of time\nAnd ... makes it a point to tell us that this severe about the divine confession occurs after Jesus was praying alone\nAnd even though many would just pass right by this this really matters because there are seven times that looks gospel that he mentions about Jesus praying alone seven times Luke emphasizes Jesus his own personal prayer time and his own personal communion and fellowship and dependence on the father\nAnd she flew through this gospel record starting a chapter six verse twelve you're going to see this again and again and again seven times and many of those times it was an all night prayer meeting others were early in the morning praying to the father was an absolutely critical event in the life of Jesus\nConsistent pro long times in the presence of God his father\nAnd remember that Jesus was not preying on his own behalf\nBut there was nothing in his life that needed to be brought before God to be altered our straightened out there was no Santa transgression that was needing to be forgiven\nJesus was and he is God he has no say in to be forgiven for he did not fail God ever you'd never even had a bad attitude not even for a millisecond", "city": "Moss Point"}
