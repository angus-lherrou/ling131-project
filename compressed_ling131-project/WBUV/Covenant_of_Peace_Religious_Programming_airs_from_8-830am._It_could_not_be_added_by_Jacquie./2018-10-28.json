Iowa radiolab just open the up and have fun\nFrom the mantle Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine so many points and I urge radio station\nWelcome to the killing of the peace radio broadcast the teaching ministry of pastor ... Bradley this program is dedicated to bringing you the glorious truth of God's word one versed at a time\nAnd then communion in the low end and baptism God gave us these things so that by of failing ourselves of them on a regular basis we would be strong in the lord and the power of his mind and that makes us able to see ourselves correctly to see ourselves as God sees us so that we will not be deceived about ourselves\nAnd here's why this is what ... says if we say we have fellowship with him and you walk in the darkness we lie and do not practiced the truth\nAnd that tells us the truth genuine salvation is not about simply praying a prayer or walking down in Iowa are raising our hands are being bad ties are joining the church are adopting some kind of moral code to live by\nTrue salvation as a supernatural miracle whereby God the Holy Spirit literally comes to us while we're yet in our sins\nWhile we're still lost while we're doing as much as we can to serve Satan into rebel against God and to run and hide from God and while we are not wanting this are carrying anything about it at all while we are wishing that God would just leave us alone\nGod the Holy Spirit comes to us before we ask him to before we desire him too before we initiate anything at all\nDot the Holy Spirit soccer league violates our will he interrupts our lives he inserts himself in us he imposes himself on to us he forcefully opens are blind dies he an stops are deaf ears he takes out of the stony heart and puts in us a hard a flash\nThat is able and willing to believe\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself without any cooperation from us at all gives us new spiritual life which is ... birthing us he regenerate sauce and that means he destroys forever the domination that sand had over us he kills and takes out of this for\nFor that falling and sinful and rebellious nature that we inherited from from Adam\nIn God the Holy Spirit all by himself gives us a new nature nature that is to find a nature that normally a naturally loves God\nAnd the things I've got a new nature that craves the presence of God in nature that hunger and thirst after righteousness a new nature that six to God's will a new nature that enjoys following after God\nA nature that relishes the ways of God that hunger for truth that desire to understand God's word in the very same way that a baby desires to milk\nIt's a new nature that thrives on the straight and narrow path that hates seeing that naturally normally loves commandments of God\nGod sovereign Lee and super naturally miraculously and forcefully takes out of us the darkness of seeing and brings us into the marvelous light of God himself\nAnd we are changed we're transformed we are a new creation and that means we are not a better or an improved version of the same old man no no\nWe have been made we have made a those who have made a conscious decision to follow Jesus or a brand new creation that possesses a brand new nature and that's the nature that we did not possess before we were saved\nAnd we are now forever set free from the ... and the dictatorial and the dominating power that sentence they can head over our lives before we were saved\nBecause that is true for every single safe person who has ever are who will ever be truly say John says here\nThat we do not and we cannot and we will not continue to walk in the darkness we will not continue on in the sand that we had been saved from we will not continue to live our lives the same way we did before we were safe precisely because we don't want to precisely because we can't\nThe new nature will not allow it we no longer enjoy it we don't crave that we no longer have anything in common with darkness we no longer have any linkage our connection to that darkness we no longer have any fellowship with the darkest because we had been brought out of the darkness and into gods marvel the flight\nAnd we see the light of God being so infinitely better so much more infinitely enjoyable so much more glorious than the darkness\nThat there is no value at all in us remaining in the darkness or having anything at all to do with it and because that is true John says here that those who\nContinue to fellowship with the darkness in other words those who do not change those who continue to see value in the end and those who continue to fellowship with sand and those who are still enamored with CNN who take pleasure in St john's says those people are deceived about their salvation\nNoticed that he says they say their site and yet they continue to walk in the darkness they say they're said but it's not been truly born again they do not possess the new nature and so even though they afraid that even though they've gone through the motions there aren't any different than they were before they prayed\nAnd the proof of this is that they continue to love they're seeing and they remain under the terrible\nBondage in power sin and they enjoy it so John says here that the conversion is alive they're conversion is not real they're conversion is false these people lie to themselves and the proof of that if they do not practiced the truth\nAnd what that and that means that what that is the normal way that they live their daily lives is no longer holy\nUC salvation is about Jesus saving our souls it is our immortal souls which are said all of our sins have been forgiven in the wrath of guard against our sense has been forever averted from us and we spend the turn of tea in heaven with God when we die but God saved our souls and not our bodies\nAnd so even after we're said we still live in a body of fallen sinful flash that has not been converted and that has not been redeemed\nSense that the sand that dominated our souls now dominates our bodies and the divine curse it was against our souls is still on our bodies and no matter how old you might be you are in the process of dying\nAnd one hundred percent of those who are alive right now will die because salvation did not change anything at all about our flash\nAnd salvation did not alter the way or the fall and world and the system by which the world operates and salvation also did not rescue the devil\nAnd so even though our souls had been forever said we're still face with a free fold danger of the world and the flesh and the devil which continues right on in their fallen and sinful ways and that means that are safe souls living a central body\nWhich dwells in sinful world which is still dominated by falling arcane journal named ... named ... suffer Satan or the devil\nIs our new divine nature compels us to serve the lord among great temptation and great obstacles and great hindrance isn't great opposition\nAnd that is why we struggle we struggle against our flash we struggle against the world and we struggle against the walls of the enemy but we do not struggle alone and we should not struggle alone ever to struggle alone is to fail and so as we struggle we must struggle together which is why God gave the church\nAnd as we avail ourselves of God's word in prayer and fellowship and communion and all the other things that I talked about we will be far better off than if we do not avail ourselves of those things it's a John calls our daily walk with God in the fall of the world and with our fallen flesh was Satan a practice\nThat is the term that he uses which tells us that we must consciously do certain things and consciously not do other things if we are to be found faithful busy can fruitful\nFor the normal and natural walk of a truly born again believer does not lend itself to send even those seeing is ever present\nThe normal daily walk up a genuine believer does not lend itself to darkness even the darkness is all around us the normal daily walk of a truly regenerate sold does not lend itself to the world of the flash or the devil even though I truly regenerate solace constantly plague by all three of these\nSo like truly saved person will send yes but\nHe will quickly repent and follow Jesus I truly safe person will find himself captured in darkness but he will see that darkness and he will repaired and returned to the light\nA truly safe person will find themselves caught up in the world but he will be convicted of that\nAnd he will repaired and returned to the straight and narrow path so while sin periodically over takes the believer it is not the normal way of life for him he is periodically overcome with temptation but that is not his daily way of life he is periodically overrun by state and but that is not his practice\nBut at the same person is known by these things these things are his daily life these things are his practice because he's not said in the power seeing has never been broken from him and he does not possess the new divine nature that is what John is saying here\nThe gospel of Jesus proclaimed as a sovereign divine call to all of those who are chosen for salvation from before the foundation of the world to consciously reject and denounce and to hate and to turn away from their sin and the way of life but his birth promoted in sustained by the last pagan world\nAnd to joyfully in humbly follow Jesus\nAs lord in mastering savior and king and father by doing what Jesus Says and by obeying what Jesus commands and by loving what Jesus loves and by hating what Jesus hey salvation then is a call to follow Jesus in both submissive and joyful obedience\nAs a bond slate with no more rights over your own life or your own desires or your own plans or your own dreams or your own ambition\nAnd this call is far more important than simply bind fire insurance on your soul and some people describe it far deeper than a prayer more eternal than raising your hand more profound than walking down in our filling out a card\nThis is not about the symbolism of a ritual ceremony is a call to a radical life of self less love\nAnd an eternal transformation from being fallen to being regenerate for being a child of Satan to being a child of God from loving send to hating seeing", "city": "Moss Point"}
