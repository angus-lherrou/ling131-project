talk about things that were happening on the field and off that you didn't like\nMhm I don't see any of that any more what I don't either when I hear antics of yes yep week I think what we're talking about somebody who's very demonstrative\nI think somebody who celebrates somebody who uh has a lot of movement after every hit snaps bats over his knee when he strikes out\nIn the world or baseball that's seen as being um attention seeking but if you put yourself weaken the NBA he would be in the middle of the road draft soccer nothing middle of the road\nPut them on a football field nothing nothing\nYou know and so you're talking about also if you really want to make baseball um you want to improve it you want to change the way that it is perceived you had to make it about the culture so I'll say this um\nYou know if you will young people young demographic they pay attention you won't people of color to really pay attention to baseball you have to make it hip and cool and fun part of the reason the NBA has been able to benefit is they embraced\nThe young people they've embrace the urban ... the urban coach you if you want to call it that\nAnd so if baseball refuses to do that they're always going to lag behind football and basketball and that you have seen\nFootball which everyone probably doesn't necessarily things but football is really a conservative ... you think about all of the out military stuff and how they basically sell the team over the individual but even they had to relent and allow players to celebrate and be more demonstrative on the field and kind of let their personalities\nAre floors and what has happened\nRatings are up ratings are a great ratings are good people are talking about it despite all the stuff people talked about what the anthem the TV ratings reflect something differently and part of that is because going up and they let letting people have fun okay if I Want to be entertained I Want to feel like the people that are entertaining me or having fun\nWhat if I turn the tables on us though for one second because I've been a pick pick pick in were picnic picnic baseball you need to change this need to change that what if I turn the tables on us for one second\nAnd I ask is part of this simply didn't twenty Eighteen we don't have the attention span\nFor baseball anymore not just as a sport but the length of the season you know you get a caller earlier talking about cost um there are one\nHundred sixty two games it does not create urgency when they're that many games\nOr to be a quote unquote season ticket holder is not only a cost issue like it is in every sport but it's quite frankly a time issue\nLike how am I going to make that worthwhile to be a season ticket holder when the team comes for a two week homestead I've got to go to the ballpark six nights a week [laughter] are you kidding me who got time for this so baseball it's why won't play fantasy baseball\nI've played than I only play fantasy football I don't do basketball either because it's a smaller version of the same thing I played fantasy baseball one time I'm like I don't I Can't do this every day\nShe can go on the website every day like let me set a lineup for one week short\nBut it's just too much do we have the attention span for these that\nYou know I think that has something to do it it is lifted you had to have a lot of stamina to be able

Fox News authorities in Pittsburgh say eleven people were killed when a man entered a synagogue and the city's squirrel hill neighborhood and open fire six other people were wounded including for police officers\nThe ah ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's the Naga bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all those of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the\nShooter advocating rational baseball game there seemed to shoot her\nEven though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American this first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a child even fill up you know\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white I remembered George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon\nAnd because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to wants his picture was out there admitted that he was this panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced they were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual said into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou have you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist in his ... and that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for ... that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is well correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example to resemble a vet with the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out this\nAppointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be under the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is\nFamily or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI might take some

are you\nI'm good thanks for having me on what what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get into the incredible succession\nThe positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person but police say the FBI shows was this idiot but since I got a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lot and right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I had to get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these postal facilities and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah I I I took a A R e fighters advice early on and said you know so much stopped talking about by politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that\nUm is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling you bowed demographer bomber the ... the people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a senior shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took a swing so do you want to take some ground is the second I looked out the was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just well about foreign minister ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah\nMedia um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is all be blamed president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are filing when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them\nThat are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up of baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to lead the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative than President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that the ... the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges from\nThe Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt it's a remarkable success yet the media\nAgain is never going to give them a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nIt'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes and you're like you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American the pays taxes as a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it\nSo the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never\nShocking President Trump for Nissan for nine years Iraqi

going to have John Hi Bush shown to use going to be the bottom up next our use the executive director of the regular Institute out in California great conversation to bury the media and how we treated Reagan and how we acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting towards the media also ... you'll be off the top of the hour\nYup the former communications director for president Donald Trump what the hell out but they're easily on the job for eleven days or bad for you to write none of the phone line so let me see a little walk and chew on line one is Lisa in California Lisa\nI'm living the dream which I but\nI like the last caller talking about I'm\nSure for gold are on that story ... ... ... how would you\nStart out the bad guys again I'll tell you I'm a great guy but you know I when I go to church I go to church and I don't like that\nAnybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWell I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I terrier done everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my garden\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado\nThat guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and they'll be do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody get a good move there can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they could pull the trigger one gun\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it moved in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House\nSo show the people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near that place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal on you know those are those are those items that it's not just that have an accent the people around them and then at church probably qualified people that are going to be there any way that I\nEnded up in their training and then right no I just feel like\nIt like I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nI I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if they do allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be ... to ... to ...

six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect other us\nWell yeah what was there for a wedding date it was a\n... amazing days come on let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president\nYou know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN and trust and what I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the\nPresident is telling it like that and he's covering the truth\nIs doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rock\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've been working CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean I did that when you walk it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some lip poked from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these or this morning and I'm trying to sell it\nBecause they could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they don't support loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him you know what he's like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger\nYou know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent for Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt ... one of his best friend said the same thing you know could listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing\nLast too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for Pagliaro\nSo why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like Anthony I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions credit president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm Sasha my personality\nI agree it's embodied Sarah moved to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stop because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he may tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looks for a cost them out and tries to tell me your fake news oh I don't understand it and then he turned and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really really good pick\nUp a time I understand what happened but\nUm when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nAdam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe you announced era as press secretary I did the first press conference and I saw Sarah that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net Mike ... plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to\nEat was being very of secrets and flattering to me any begging me effectively did do a profile story with him yeah ... trail me around and I'm like well I'm not the ban and I'm not their self promoting myself when I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people looking I'm like Jesus ... sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to present so what's\nThe other one I thought it looked if you went back to the right but\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's

mornings with Kelly minutes one who saw one of four nine WB is the\n\nRent radio stations across the land Joe ... dot com basically would arrange to ramp email all of them were right there is a joke it's the ... you know also\nThe blaze radio network a lot of you listening to appreciate you every single time it is your boy Joe ... a note about ... before I go to John ...\nA couple of things are important number one when you go to a radio show or you can both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you gotta stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she felt that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control\nOf of what's being hurt at any given time I know I have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair a guy that I'll stop and let you continue\nBut if you ... allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there were there were a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or it'd be the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very are there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about is whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about 'cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't produce law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down shore or they're bad people and I absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on and you actually believe\nThat if you use a pro white supremacist guy he's not he's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms were I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called\nBut I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this and when he talks as have stay like that the ... he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know just spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't in mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are a ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me with Donald Trump um stupid so you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant wouldn't the hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV guided know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact to intimidate the more than I Do but you failed any debate when you walk in picking your superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get a little but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi bushy who's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate you are you\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plaintiff some short in some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jet setting foot off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point to Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under
