{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "With Philip absolutely want to pick a ... ... who did\nWhat did I pick up around and around how's that going to pick a receiver in a world I don't I just want to be a concern I like that I have some of those moment I don't I just didn't feel like picking the garden variety quarterback yeah yeah now these rules all the way they are I don't think they ever will be anything but a quarterback ever again would have to be\nA Randy Moss season yeah you're right yeah but the paycheck I\nThought the Steelers all I mean it's just I thought they were going to be even\nMore bananas then they usually are my reasoning was Mason Rudolf ... they're rafting of him ticked off Ben Roethlisberger and they were just going to come out and lay lights out was that was what the thought was was going into the year and they they've been as an off and said okay they have\nBeen ... been a bit it's been overstated profits of while I'm there\nYes and then their defense isn't any good which is another reason why sometimes it often has to be right like more homes the numbers are crazy sometimes good to have\nTo score thirty five or forty to wear a very good point except last week of all the pictures I pick twelve yup I'm aren't so so with that being said what else you know I Am a little\nWorried about this when I did pick the the Steelers to win the super or the represent\nThe AFC I'm Sorry I thought it to you both picks the Steelers go all the way to do oh why oh shoot I mean they don't say they'll say that [laughter] I'm I'm cherry picking the ones I talk about okay so out of\nIt but I still like who I pick to represent the NFC and the super bowl was that\nThat would be the Carolina Panthers the Carolina so that's why you asked that like I was kind of random ... just like I was talking about math but won't be now I don't want no it's not really the same markets and disrespect and nobody talks about\nCam Newton and the Panthers enough now it's not sexy he's not going to\nThrow over seven hundred yards and all these crazy amounts he's not going to Patrick homes you but he is going to do for a buck eighty you're going to run for eighty you'll get your three total touchdown maybe throw a pig but in the team keeps winning and now they get his favorite target back in ... do you watch out\nFor the panther you want to know what's wild though it's funny you talk about it a quarterback kind of doing this thing and the team keeps winning have you noticed more and more each year that that kind of thing matters last\nIt what pops in the mind of the majority of NFL fans is fantasy football oh yeah\nI ... you can play well and they can win but if Cam Newton is gonna fall like twelve on the fence you chart people will think he's the middle of the pack quarterback\nI Know you know he's become and his teams have become they're usually good sometimes great like when they were Fifteen in one a couple of years back I'm Steve McNair Steve mcvarish that's never\nWild you per se wasn't lighting you will but he just he beat you such a winner\nAnd you know you look at how they how they search even three every year I you know I ... you know twelve and four and then in the yard away from one of the super bowl\nAnd he was the reason he just knew how to when I got to run on his way to pick up these six yards I Will if I have to make this keep throwing ... may not be a bomb but it'll be so tired at or below quick out he just made game when he plays Steve McMahon would be nothing when it came to fantasy this\nYou know this generational no\nNo there's there are so many quarterbacks performing it's it's insane I ended up actually notice off the top of my head because it came up in a conversation yesterday if I asked you right now tell me where Tom Brady ranks in passing yard itch\nOh wow passing yard it's Tom Brady I'm gonna go maybe fifth mhm do you\nKeep going go lower lower tens going Eighteen keep going twenty nine\nTeen Tom Brady is Nineteen\nNick I needed to do that he could do I need to hold up wait I got it okay\nOkay Mahoney yes he agrees yes in passing yard in rises burger yes yellow rivers Jess Massey Stafford probably\nOh there are names you wouldn't believe that's what I'm saying now does adamant case keen him they had a Tom Brady past no right now son James cannot believe\nThat that

captivity ... took time out to the president's dropping members of Congress why they are fighting for his readers\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and is like now giving her ... ... ... years the odds\nThen and the whole thing is odd but what was the models involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an actor that you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking never as good as they do\nBut they keep on presenting a listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says really equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on at USA Today I'm confused why are we doing a story and listen to the lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity\nThe country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then Christie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care white illicit model thinks why she's not an expert\n\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or the big screen for a long time\nAnd we share interests sells well we were you for some reason project intelligence on\nThem a list of a lotto is not intelligent she's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense yet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like ... like me\nTo buy use it as far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't when was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people arguing may\nSay well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb the the thing is that she's saying or look at and taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThat don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa Milano and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe a list of all I Do because filling the blunt just doesn't happen oh another trendy thing that's happening today which\nWill boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery robbery we of course the Confederate general who\nLost and had to surrender to sue us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert ... period and their story and of course that's the only period\nAnd the story of your legacy media about large to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in Ulysses Grant kicked his ass\n\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a set of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praised Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth it's the best thing I'm going to go to my my plane back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good that he kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\n\nThat was the context but why tell the truth when you can lie and then corrected later and by the way on social media will you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a retreats

having me\nA vigil for not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday just people no I was actually and this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is a good point they should maybe you've got a famous name it cracked me up when you reach your was do you remember what you said you stood each really me I promise [laughter]\nTo\nGo back and forth and I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot in general we get along so thank you for doing that and do you know it's funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in

connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet but you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll is just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to get a fake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd Stone\nBy that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out because you press the button you took my first time in ... her that's her that's ...\n... and not know you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator as a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican\nIQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further\nWriting campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave her daughter that job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on German and I ran against him into heated yep that's how we got and that's how we stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have special interests from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no\nRational reason that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she daddy good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait\nIt was about calls like of course it is and whether he's a good madam yes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you know you are you why was it up in our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska\nAnd just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going right in my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court to the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Chuck amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know talking about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal core\nYou is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be

counted in critical elections and it's like\nOh well like here we have I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken wanted he shouldn't have but suddenly the votes

even the Washington Post columnist your mouth because show he disappeared after ending the so entering the Saudi conflict in eastern bowl and he is feared dead\nBecomes a Christian then off to the war\nHe realizes that he knows where all the Soviet agents are the U.S that it's ... yeah and he says I Do the right thing on each one cup of these mold that that I was working with it goes to the FBI\nFBI is an interest that he goes to the White House the truly ministry not interested and finally in Nineteen forty eight it gives the first ever televised a congressional testimony as a congressional stuff that you may have heard of Richard Nixon has yet\nTo really um you know a stimulated get motivated by the testimony that he says\nI Know where the bad guys on one of them is is former president slip by a former State Department official shops you know the left a darling of the media called out ... is right and he goes on record for the truth is that this man is a communist and he's a spy the left\nDecides to destroy him\nThey publicly accused him of being an alcoholic of being a closet homosexual they say that this man is responsible for the death of his own brother ... all of it is an ... up to lie but chambers never give us and he never surrenders and eventually logged off the heat that\nWe have been known to the ... the Soviet signals intelligence intercept\nThat proves that yes lo and behold out this was a Soviet agent at the top about government\nSo if you're surprised at what the Democrats did the justice Kavanaugh over the last month don't be they get update done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the unknown mistake voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you when I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactor\nAct [laughter] I I it's a\nI Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rice said em oh this is a modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing or on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens when you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided\nThat the ends that they're ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set\nIt doesn't matter what I Do it to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put this in my book you know why we fight happened off they came out but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world and pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because just as what it could chambers within it said Seventy years ago so\nIs justice Kavanaugh eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going get five copies giving to your friends and family doctors Sebastian Gorka that yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book in order for me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all ... that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left\nThat that you so well said and actually talk to my my friend who had been ... about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically was it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice cabinet decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right\nAlways gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I'm ... and the strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refuse flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I tool to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record or off wreck all the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing the majority of the establishment the geo peace than it is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the show they won the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares\nAbout CNN yeah the you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watched the most quote unquote import show on CNN every night and listen to\nPlus I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... while they get all yes he\nIs the king millions and millions and millions of us every show Anderson Cooper the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow this you don't want to record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country on less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying thanks to ... and we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching this show is is what we have to break the ... the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators\nWho ... who was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody\nBe deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you and social and I said oh we're friends as well\nI'm a welder when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill\nThat says that millennials overwhelmingly\nAre liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the G O P s even things up for the race in the\nFor the house of representatives how do you balance that zero fear in your mind as there is a little bit of mine that these young people will go and vote like drones for the left they don't know why they're doing they lean left\nUm and that will somehow counterbalance those of us who actually have studied these things that are more middle age or a little older that will go to them not to go to the polls to how do you counter balance that you have a fear of what's going to happen in the house\nLook I I'm a happy warrior like Reagan I Am an optimist I think we can we can we can take ... we can keep the house keep the Senate the millennials are problem if you look at the victims of communism foundation they did a poll that said forty two percent of millennials want this to live in a social\nNot us they didn't know what what is\nBut but but you know there's two reasons not for a number one ... a lot of millennials just don't vote ... this is amazing gun you chew called Austin flat go see goes by the name of flack this on ... ... ... e\nC C C a s what's his videos he goes to the rally she goes to the you know dumb Trump rallies and he goes to the camera and and to use these millennials and he asked them you know all these amazing questions and then he says so did you vote and sixteen and they always say no\nThey don't vote they'll they'll go out in

percent shoe in New York Post I saved the tweet Ninety five percent\nIt makes me laugh every time how stupid they were about the entire thing\nThat I think\nHe now we're going to see even more people

website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network who's the weekend with Joe ... glad to have you you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the former governor great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well with the actors that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know Texas but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected\nWith several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be an all those markets because it's\nYou know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five caught in the next group\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all completely you know good he's putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nYou use stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have\nFair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you liked Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does it go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce\nWilbur Ross day all have a role to\nPlay in that and and uh so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left\nIn for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is a but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals he comes with some really hard stuff I\nMean do you think about with you and then a young and came back in here\nUh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs at retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick\nPerry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage so you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as one side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh are developing a the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing\nWe got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the ah ah you\nNot only are there homes more affordable but they also take less time to build an are completely customize

you're doing something about to protect yourself\nThe headline from NBC News so it could be fake news NBC News the same outlet that his pretending to president is holding Roberts Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked a low ugly about Ulysses Grant ...\nBut it fits their narrative better to pretend like you said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh forty million people being exposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most recent churches Facebook's it\nDavid Ingram wrote this\nFacebook said on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of forty million people through security flaws of the company first disclosed last month and other data exposed

but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate thinking about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and it's all Facebook is a freaking website some dupe is made up a website and college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus\nThough Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judge made at Facebook that\nYou know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys on our girls sure\nIt was that what you're sharp picture to it and let's go out there will be connected that then it became a very powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you follow somebody you solve their stuff every time they follow Jewish all your stuff every time then they started employing something they call an algorithm\nThat didn't make up a term obviously

then it's I'm only going to send you the stuff we want you to see\nAnd now that we're floating around in a website that were started trying to find hot chicks on campus now we have no idea whether we have any privacy at all\nI mean it's logical and rational to fake I've connected with\nMartin on Facebook I should be able to see more and stuff if you took the connection if I'm not connected to him I shouldn't be able to see his stuff maybe as profile picture of your lets me maybe the fact that he has a profile but it's fine but whatever he doesn't want me to see I shouldn't see\nThese hackers were able to go on there and see everything\nEverything and in some instances we don't even know how many really very able to take over\nThe actual social media presence\nThat's and that's to me man that's crazy\nAnd still be stories are reporting so infrequently\nWe have no idea what people are doing on Facebook or Twitter with our stuff we found out not long ago from project very tossing James

continue arms sales to Saudi Arabia after a Washington Post columnist your mouth to show the disappeared inside the Saudi conflict in eastern bowling as feared dead former UN ambassador Bill Richardson\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got that ... they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you want to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nMe again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick him off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been they've had this primal screams cents a day after you\nAnd when the wrong person according to them one I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage just administration from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race did Wisconsin let's talk about the an Affordable Care act you supported the president as it all Republicans and I was that all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxing the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys did a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this is a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember president bomb if you'd like health care plan and keep it ya families who have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer renew ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her by Medicare plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks a year you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums cross because American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing in the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't\nGet the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be out to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay that no this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really wouldn't be argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care\nWill reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only costs thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business\nTaxes at least double and it's still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening you're watching the right down the number thirty two trillion then realized how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one

guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's a financial markets thing or potential question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the manager director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams that associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJohn great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo and that when we get eleven hundred points it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are do you know be\nI think the stock market as a slot machine anyway so I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing\nThat made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of thanks Joey what's always interesting about the market is\nThings that we know that are potential headwinds the market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs that often and so it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here is we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough a a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies a pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything towards Seventy but still it's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell but\nDo you have a pretty large dug out all the managing director senior vice president over it originated associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy is much stronger than it was\nWhen President Trump took office you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable ... which they were there do you mean to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable ...\n... I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... the tank and he's ... the the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments are emerging that associates so as\nWe watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look how great I Am I'm this of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst thing\nFor you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for his bridges\nYeah no I I think are so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fats in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in and income a into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "13"}
