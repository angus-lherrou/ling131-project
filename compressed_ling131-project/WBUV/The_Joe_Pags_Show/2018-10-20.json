I'm a little nervous I've never been on the radio or but\nIt okay to come down to these policies you know we had the catch and release policy and then we had been in charge of it which I'm you know I absolutely love what we should be doing or what Trump said earlier on the spot on every which way I can buy them one hundred percent but my question is\nWhy are these policies overriding laws we had to catch and release policy for years we know when nine eleven to the beach area a cat or the Mexican border and they weren't stopped because of a policy we have is facing prior to that Nineteen Ninety three\nOh we had to the world Trade Center jak though most of the younger generation doesn't even know about you know it's right in the morning\nI'm but why are these policies um how did it get weight over the wall it happened to you isn't it true I've seen where businesses are excelling a perfectly legal product and a credit card companies will have a policy in place as well we can't provide your service if you don't agree with what you do\nFollow the White House to override federal laws because if she should be the policies have started all the issues in the first place or they're voting vote on the ... you know what's the use of having a law is a a policy can just be but it's like there's a lot\nBut I got I got to run I appreciate you did just fine on the radio I can comment on that at the top of the hour the weekend coming right back [noise]\n\n... rules for alerts and offers me automatic tax message Muscatine originally applied\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great tasting dinners at home and it's easy to forget about frozen foods and take out instead join me for great home cooked food introducing Martha ... meal kittens repression fresh ingredients with my wonderful easy to follow recipes delivered break your door\nAnd right now you can try to treat for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha and Merle eastern meals to everyone\nAnywhere imagine cooking butter based at stake Berkshire pork tenderloin key stuffed chicken and more with new recipes every week Martha Ann Marie ... helps you put a delicious dinner on your table and around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping tends to young to two four six eight ten just kept the word young to two four six eight ten for details hurry three free won't last long taxed young to two four six eight ten\nMinute we're here for thirty eight years and that says a lot about the company I worked for and the great friends I work with like Katie and say\nHi agree Walter and I've been here for a title is eight years working with you and everybody here on harnessing confident experience\nAnd I love being able to help people like Omar gray and grace furniture gallery watering Katie I'm advertise on I ... for several years and everyone we deal with a heart is made it was it's obvious that I hardee's or ... or send your emails Biloxi jobs that I Horton media dot com\nThe Gulf Coast new is casino come\nIn today and experienced is not really getting out we'd incredible view is more slapping table games now you can enjoy a great promotions that both casinos that again will choose to have a coupon you'd want anything I think we Saturday\nThree winners that me ten minutes we're getting to hundred and fifty dollars then\nSunday joined a blink of fun to winters every Fifteen minutes well went up to one thousand dollars he's more for you\nI mean did you see now he's doing ... from the men do viewing GMC studios he's used talk going on for nine\nPoint and I urge radio station\nThe Saudis story I'm ... Fox News Saudi Arabia's citizens arrested a team in connection with the death of Jim all cause show gets a consulate in is ten bowl the kingdom says ... died after a fight broke out but there's worldwide skepticism over this statement\nThey have no real ... other than rent debt obstruct and quite frankly do should let them at that point which should err everybody that I'm you know important for the future of the country or the foreign progress of the president's agenda to get out and vote in the near term\nIt's Lara Trump we love having Ron each at Laura Lee Trump on Twitter right\nThat's correct L. E. A. by now and\nI'm just saying and I follow you and your husband asked me I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but\nWhen I was probably ... or or by that okay I appreciate it um you know traditionally you bring up cabinet I've been told him to the cabinet bounds but it happened so early that I feel like things might cool down before the midterms and been dying and Feinstein yesterday what gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into no justice Kevin ... Laura she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we thought how crazy they got during the actual confirmation pot that\nIt's it's really terrifying it is finally showing their true colors that Democrats you know they really don't stand for much that's trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do\nOne of the reasons I think that you eat do much with your defense out there and because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning\nThe country again and and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life is over and they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC\nWell not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so it makes them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he he's doing this because he loved his country now to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more reason that we need all the Republicans support we can in Congress\nThat is a lawyer a Trump but really great to talk to you if your brother in law I asked the ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this what was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but\nHis love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like your mother in law was really going to take this stuff\nAnd he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level right\nBut but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating you see when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what hair of the trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepare you for for all of this\nUm it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day none of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and\nIf we have to take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because\nI really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest president the country's ever had\nA job as a group that is Laura Trump or husband his or her father in law is the president of a I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the the media would come after the electric come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media\nActually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this show when it was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know when he said um that that was it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child\nI mean it's the talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the term became president that if he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end do\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that you do in a great jobs\nI Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family you've ever seen in my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law of very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface as you know he's a former left wing social justice Scalia ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie Stabenow was been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show the ... seat this really use gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for him is really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota\nNot traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful\nI Will be on Tuesday ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's with a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted along side president and and really pushes agenda forward we can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism\nIf anybody has any question about what socialism look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that\nSince shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty things seem to get Donald Trump elected in certainly certainly was the fight isn't over you you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent we have to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIs only run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to their shoes are delicious whose whose wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting 'cause there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first it has made him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country or tells you a ... you got people who are actually showing the sky Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nTo Florida last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we reached Asians or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis sleep on TV okay there during you right now\nUm when you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country\nThat's what they're running on and the fact is there almost fifty fifty right now and it was the ripple you see what is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president's the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know do that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the polls weren't sure and a great point I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that calls them or coaches them on the street said they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people\nWhenever they come out and support him to president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little hesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nWhenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... rarely come in this country in almost in less than two years under President Donald Trump through\nAnd not only the five and it took so long for them to come up with the Seventeen Days around the widows or because they don't have got the number of key issues who sends a theme to uh to stumble where is the body or can they do an autopsy a lot of questions really still and all that\nI found the investigation they just announced last night they television is an Eighteen individuals have now being arrested who all they can hold him responsible for that all those Eighteen Fifteen of them are the same individuals who have painted on the TV footage entering Istanbul by private jet\nFox's Benjamin hall President Trump says he'll pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia because he says Moscow's violating the agreement\nYou made the statement and ... where he held a campaign rally in support of incumbent senator Dean Heller president took an opportunity to attack former BP Joe Biden was also at a rally in Nevada\n\nBoy Joe Biden we want ... percent Joe because he ran at least twice I think three times twice I think he ran three times\nAnd you never had more than one percent\nJoe Biden was at that rally were talk to about what makes a great candidate that character\nThey would they say they say what they mean and I do what they say they're going to do\nAnd that's the single most significant thing that's missing\nIn Washington DC now\nEarly voting began today in the veteran this was Fox News\nThis is talk went on for nine [noise] bought 'em all\nUs as two thousand Honduran migrants who were part of a larger caravan trying to make its way to the U.S turned around and headed back to Honduras the remaining migrants are in Guatemala at a border crossing with Mexico or authority or letting some through who want to apply for refugee status\nAt least three people were dead in Afghanistan after an explosion at a polling station during the parliament election\nThe Taliban had always threatened to disrupt this election it won't people not to that but that was the last time that despite those re fat and not have chaos now voting with late in several locations because of a technical glitch with a new biometric voting equipment\nWas designed to stop fraud and many people were waiting in long lines to vote there will also reports of polling stations no taping a tool\nAnd election failing to show up\nNow these all the fest parliamentary elections in Afghanistan in eight years almost two and a half thousand candidates they're competing for two hundred and fifty seat in Afghanistan's\nParliament getting Logan European and Japanese space agency says spacecraft with two probes is on its way to a joint mission to study the closest planet to the sun not\nPlanet is mercury the European space agency and the Japanese aerospace exploration agency\nSaid the unmanned that'd be Colombo spacecraft successfully separated\nAnd there were sent into orbit to begin a seven year journey to mercury the spacecraft is named after Italian scientist Joe's that'd be that'd be Colombo\nThe European space agency says the one and a half billion dollar mission is one of the most challenging and its history Mercury's extreme temperatures the intense gravity pull the sun and blistering solar radiation make for hellish conditions\nHandling Fox News ... this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is Kelly ban it from this morning's with uncle Henry on these ... before nine W.

I've always been against abortion extended her rate you know but that changed my mind right there and then when I went back to have the lady uh at the reception sign for it\nThey had a a magazine right there and I kind of started that let's do it I just after what it was and she said miss new catalog and\nIt was it was just like a ... any catalog or or or Sears catalog and a half a T park\nAnd uh at prices for a full faces arms fingers and I was just it was something new and she was you know uh but you know thank goodness I I didn't have to go back and I told my boss to fire me if I went back in there\nWell Jim ... is startling and certainly rather you shared it but I I got to be honest with you I'm a bind but there was a JC penny type catalog with baby parts on it I mean it had to be something other than a catalog but what is it what you saw what was I don't know\nI'm\nI'm a college or the catalog has a title in the front what did it say\nI didn't I didn't even look at it 'cause I always found it through it and ask her why she was I didn't follow it and I'm a born again Christian I wouldn't lie to you I mean I Know what I saw\nNo you you you you sound like I'm just really honest guy I just believe there is a catalog\nWith baby hearts of armies are obviously has been exposed through undercover investigation that a lot of these abortion providers are in fact dealing in baby parts and body parts it was disgusting and it makes me sick I Would be ... we'd be startled if you saw a JC penny like catalogue\nWith baby parts of listed ... maybe ... maybe you were describing it incorrectly ... wasn't a catalog what you do you know shopping for close so that's that could be\nIt hit was ... and I looked at ... and it had baby parks with prices by him I I notice I Do I I'm not going to like this\nIs what would you want you to get offended but but I find it extremely hard to believe the other part of your story I find to be very believable and I'm Sorry that you went through the Web UPS thing that I say one thing that you could say whatever you want but what I'm saying is if you can't tell me what the title of the catalog was I mean you're actually tonia some through like a JC penny catalogued it makes no sense to me\nWhen I went through it I just I Wish [laughter]\nAs horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid as as as horrible as abortion providers are they're not stupid enough to leave a book like that around for anybody to see\nIt had just come in the mail she had was brand new\nBut the thing I Want to I Want to it's just like you know the cabinet or hearing and the lady said she was traumatized\nAnd I don't buy it for it because you if you're traumatized you elaborate things that that happened I I mean I tell ya yeah where I was I can tell you I mean they're staying traumatized me and I know what I saw\nI I Believe you think you saw something like that I'm here to tell you I Know I saw ...

would be a it would be bad for me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really got what I mean we thought I'm born and

talking around us is former congressman he's a Republican running for governor ... bill um um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that\nVoting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast um or going to be out ... and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is\nThey'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were

and other counties or your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of\nThis debt to deal with I think they will appreciate it\nOr to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor the great state of Florida wrong you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love the way to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there is there is a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern tier of Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenge is it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guy that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country had been in the Congress\nThe elements hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great\nThat you get one of those it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA total of indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which is really\nA very hostile to Israel now\nHe's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic\nOr Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote\nAnd would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics and in
