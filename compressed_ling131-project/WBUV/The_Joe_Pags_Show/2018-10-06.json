B. U. V.\nFrom the men do view it GMC studios his talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station [noise]\nThis is a Fox\nNews alert on Rogers stir and its official Brett Kavanaugh will be the next justice on the Supreme Court the Senate confirming him just one hour go by boat slim as the margins\nHer her very good friend late somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite well Christie lousy Ford testified in front of this panel the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody charge credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWe're surely does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house would was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as\nShe might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets to help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThere were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but whose member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face now she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacting her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something\nHappened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it so which Kavanaugh said you know there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is truly sweat Nick who\nSays that for three years Brett Kavanaugh on mark judge worthy organizers\nOf parties where there would be trains are boys are taking a gang rape Kavanaugh and judge she said which spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she went to ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nWill continue to go into the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay heat that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker robots called Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that\nHe's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent Cory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women\nHas said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist who's a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in ... didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today\nHave these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us I mean listen the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh\nThey're still it's tempting they're still exempting these days are rapists serial rapists rapist on the court\nIt's it's a disgusting display their trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China oh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with but\nCome on man so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every in your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a political you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree

enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nA delegation like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing compared that with Kavanaugh right if we let women like to come forward and get it kind of damage to finance reputation it's actually going to set back women path defined by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBickering women have notoriously gun at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now\nIt's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and they came to that if she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're\nExamining the person for a job in a court where he has to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotions when it's being attacked and got like\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean you facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen and then be hard you know going to be here and and liberal hinted about this I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened\nDo you and I'm Glad that you're a

without being able to testify for a week right allegedly on the grounds that Dr Ford because of her trauma was afraid to fly well not just went out the window so that's a pretty big why\nDo you ever given him the committee would go to her over the church where they would so the whole thing was do is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who died regarding whichever ... sided than\nI have all refuted it they didn't know he did not have been refuted what'd you say you're in colder no more Mr White guy I'm going to I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is futile having trouble getting left last has lost its collective mind and we are we seeing that with\nCattle and we really are in and I got to tell you I don't know\nI'm I'm kind of dumb in a mostly white although my skin is much more Italian all of a book or I'm a white guy and I'm watching it in Ford is white and blue sweat Nick is white\nAnd there were white men on the left though we're asking questions and they were really mad blooming voted lawyers face off he was really mad I'm all these people everybody involved with the stories wide except for Deborah Ramirez and we can argue about whether Hispanics or white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the effect of hum he has an odd fondness for whites autocrats\nI Do remember that no I yeah so okay\nCast your mind once again we're going to think about actual fact here catch your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been white authoritarian rulers\nWell I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I wouldn't move my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats an authoritarian rulers in in in the far east\nUm I guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly style one\nHe's even Khrushchev right but she throws\nAnd that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just it's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um it's really bad\nThat's why\nIt's so bad because of his white noose in colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left the media you've got to understand they have all these white men will be questioning this woman the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to them and there's been\nSome discussion but you'll be centers will happen to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand that there's so much anger\nAgainst white men and so much guilty in white men themselves that this crap works in\nA it doesn't work on may nor me and I as I Am I'm slowly dude\nI um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean at least understand the logic of saying it should be women women understand massage any and that should be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women with him and they pick the OJ jury\nRight or a member that was Marsha Clark big idea\nI'm black white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson didn't work out for oh ... oh I guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should they should be\nQuestioning actually don't you have all these\nRape laws as Janine bureau said right bless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean I just don't feel\nWhen he wrote about America he wrote about how the ... the crime of rape\nIn ... in contrast to even you know other European countries which was what he was familiar with the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds to murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is a lot of\n'em and it has always been ... wow American women don't know what they're asking for if they want to throw over the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nKnow it really has been in culture the name of the book is resistance as you do have it from hitting left lost its collective mind she's written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors of pass and you see the blood evidence always show that I knew that the kids are being him were seven billion to one\nSo there's a chance it wasn't him go through one\nOf the the the the bottom line is and I'm going to ask you about this before we run out of time to ask you about Jeff Flake or if you're in charge of this committee wires used do better when he says I'm not running for reelection when he says that I'm Out of your what do you make so much noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad why is that guy that we\nStill want to be a limit on the Judiciary Committee do you have any clue\nThat's a really great point Republicans do not think seeing these things out strategically Republicans are used to being over just going to be gentleman we're not going to say\nI'm strategize um and and and look I Love 'em this week but don't get too high on Lindsey Graham run he's the sort of Republican and takes the position well if I keep voting for Democrat nominees just even though I Know they're going to be total disasters on the court maybe maybe Democrats will reward my good\nNever happened never\nReturned my next to ... you know you got to start thinking about this and advance guys\nRuth Bader Ginsburg Ninety six to three she was confirmed think about that how radically left you use and you write these people like Lindsey Graham and in the late John McCain's vote that they were going to\nGet paid back the pay back to screw you were not going to allow you to do it and it happens every single time it's colder get the book resistance as you tell how the Trump hitting left lost its collective mind last question does he get confirmed or not because there was that about him being a rapist any more about him being an angry drunks\nAnd beer a hotline\nFor exactly right and he's drawing ...\nHall if they would go with anything that is so obvious that this is unfair I mean I Can't think about anything else I I I'm outside I get splashed with a puzzle and I think I was just going to affect cabinet\nI wake up and it must be how um you know Hillary\nSupporters felt the day after the election right our side is not going to let Republicans given this time I tend to say yes um I think he will be confirmed and I would like to add Joe pacts um I think he should invite Julie sweat next to his swearing in ceremony on the ground set without her this might not have been possible\nAnd listen when NBC News has to admit that there are inaccuracies are differences in her two stories you know it's wildly just made up has to be right\nYes how ... how many ex boyfriend that she threatened to kill and and killed her unborn children how many lawsuits against her for false allegations of sexual misconduct and our own sexual misconduct\nAnd you remind you most believing the victim slash survivor which matter where you want to meet with him so\nI Want her on TV twenty four hours a day\nIn golden we always appreciate the time and the access she's awesome and uh\nAnd very very very spot on here when it comes to cabin on this debacle again keep in mind those of you listening to the show after noon or at at night on Saturday or on Sunday the confirmation vote has already
