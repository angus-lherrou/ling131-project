if I were in Ilan mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well\nI Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines if\nIf you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand than two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty ... doesn't believe that\nThat that may be more that that may do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems may be much much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels the technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence in one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people got excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter they kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business and ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has\nA ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nIntelligence the simplest definition is\nSystem that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is something way more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure that somebody wearing a puppy or carrying a gun\nMhm and then it was up you would say well that that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to ... to an artificial intelligence\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and show a it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems\nGoing to have it well for\nFor three very easy reasons you can argue the uh the the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving\nLives of soldiers ...\nA ... and ... and whatever country you are and and a third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political cost going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing well\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't

nine for nine radio that's one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\n\nWalking back by run race with a survivor and do you think technology\nGene will ever replace pulse to people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I have a I have a feeling that\nAny job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job this word for that that's called the\nHumanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor a machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that we invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine young machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years has ... has had unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages\nAnd because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of the city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt's hard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's going to be this Web thing ... billion people are going to use it what do you think there's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody\nEvery time technology makes a great new job and destroys a bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they use spill a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult\nYeah so well\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes other batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it\nTells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell\nWith physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer\nAnd it may be that that you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain a three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we're so spectacularly amazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it to overcome scarcity\nAll of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world\nAnd so I Do think that um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robust\nThat's a revolutionized the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh\nYou're ... you're right that dog official intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nThat could bring total devastation to parts are state especially in the panhandle that's Florida's governor Rick Scott who was declared a state of emergency nearly three dozen Florida counties Alabama's governor Kay Ivey issuing a similar declaration for her entire state but when that storm will land not entirely clear yet\nSome of these tracks and this would be the eye of the storm taking it over Pensacola other tracks taking the eye of the storm over Appalachian coal a little farther up towards the east but by and large the larger Winfield there is going to affect a large area across the entire panhandle flex\nMeteorologist Adam Block says Michael is likely to make landfall as a category ... storm sometime on Wednesday a ceremony at the White House Monday Night for nearly confirmed Supreme Court justice Brett capital brought an apology from the man who nominated him to Brett\nAnd the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure as\nCapital here his first of all our oral arguments on Tuesday a prayer vigil in New York state Monday Night for the victims of the week in limbo crash while investigators continue to probe the cause\nNTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt since there's a lot that must be looked at in this crash wear seatbelts war was the car rode worthy and then there's the cars ability to stop\nYeah is there any evidence at all that they were actually being applied or there's no apparent skid marks\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo says the limo what converted SUV failed state inspection and should have been off the road he says he wants to be operators shut down for the time being we're doing a\nFor\nAlcohol and drive our health or other factors being assessed Fox's girls Scott says Fox News [noise]\nThis is talk went out for night honest opinion [noise] other social\nMedia network has been hacked by preachers Google they saw me\nStreet Journal article details and Google Plus a software glitch which potentially game developers access to private information is nearly five hundred thousand users between two towns in Fifteen in March of ... here the report claims Google parent company out that that did not call it the issue when it was first discovered to avoid damage to its reputation and regulation\nGamble on post Google says the bug potentially those data including users names birth dates profile thought I was an email addresses but he can not confirmed which you guys were impacted and found no evidence any developer Nikki huge profile information\nFox is Christian good when reports Google plans to shut down the consumer version of Google Plus because of low usage a construction worker is dead five co workers hospitalized after a three story town house they were building in Dallas collapsed during a thunderstorm Monday\nNational Weather service reported wind gusts in excess of sixty miles an hour at the time postal workers and their supporters spent part of the Columbus Day holiday protesting what they see as a White House push\nTo make the U.S postal service a private entity or the sun shines gripe land the plane apparently good for the marijuana is more\nThan Seventy three hundred people have applied to get a medical marijuana license in Oklahoma with six hundred applications for dispensaries medical marijuana became legal in the state earlier in the year but officials are still working on licensing patients growers and dispensaries\nIf all of the applications were approved the ratio of patients to dispense ... will be about twelve to one commercial dispense re license applications costs twenty five hundred dollars and the application process has already generated more than five million dollars with the state rich Dennison Fox News\n...

do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred and bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come

this you know pale blue dot\nScott Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the show interesting topic I I just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technologies progressing that we may get to that and you're still at the age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause\nWorking alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like\nWell what happened 'cause GDP did a poll just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more\nAnd so there is no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor because I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies\nBut it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week if if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now\nTechnology um\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine\nA\nFix by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nYeah I guess than ... than ... than now and Ken ... and and ... they're trying to take care\nAnd then me and tell them that any him an M ... and ... it gets half the fan I'll listen off the\nAir talking about automatic guns\n[noise] well I Know you're you're tied the guests bart is entirely right\nUm we are using a condom his weapons that may kill decision of course we've done that\nSince landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that they kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just does it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's gonna out jumped\nTo very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened what if you look starting seventeenth fifty shut up like a rocket\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created or eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming it's all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all the hungry people\nNot world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as

know this it's it's a ... is a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data and\nAnd I'm and I'm known you know within the organization is being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling the stories um they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't make that stuff and you know um I Would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um\nYou know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so\nYou know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into the ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of those things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and go so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nThat are saying\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you

timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\nAnd and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with ...\nYou have been doing sham me these what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found I used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um it\nWas an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron outta phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're or it's not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did\nYou I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted to get these strange thing\nYeah I um\nYou know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started you know after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um\nYou know I kinda panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know much\nRight right I ... it was an atheist can't\nPossibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really\nReally take pictures of goes um so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is try and understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the

Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think it's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line\nOn is when this can happen again is just a theory\nIt's a pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I\nThink that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book um uh of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could but you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them so

because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not\nVery nice [noise]\nAnd I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\n\nIt was him I don't think it was like that that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonist and this person's life and\nMine is if I accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under
