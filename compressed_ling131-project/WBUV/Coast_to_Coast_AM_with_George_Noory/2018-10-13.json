Obama's among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher now imagine this for about\nA president with dandy two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\n... it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or is it in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll of the lives that were thrown out there where perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was

we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that well you know about the you know if you like your doctor you keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have\nIf they had the type of impact in elections\nAnd that many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know mental they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better knees are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are

stories out of the week that uh you know how to wind up where I look at it like you know I didn't really know\nWhat are some of your favorites for this week to\nThis week we got a really fun story up on the website and the number to spot of the carousel it's about an eight year old girl in Sweden\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist and so the\nThe old game is is that they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and they did accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be\nRemoved by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work\nWith people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um\nI wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete\nIndividual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know when times are already in the homes from time to come into the home they sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it it's called maybe a professional habit where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean your own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one a qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around the stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these ... with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help

about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago I did a free night and essentially at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all invitation I finally they talked me into it I actually stayed over in one of the rooms are beautiful you know\nAnd ah so ah it was essentially set up\nFor ghost hunters to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite\nMedia follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so I was sleeping I woke up about the five o'clock in the morning and I would four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was\nI didn't have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I Want to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the\nChair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak using and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room\nYou know you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely beyond the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals\nAre just working negative environments and they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what\nIs going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very beautiful but I mean think of the moon Leonard she didn't do any laid it\nAnd so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know clearly session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for ... motion\nEnergy more than people do\nNext not let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nGeorge it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but

and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of the media does but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle\nI actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the demonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas or negative\nVery negative what we might call health and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm I think of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\nWill hold on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or ordered\nTrip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to ... still your stereo or worse you\nDon't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for these birds out\nThere that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing\nRight but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... or whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions sisters out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift or I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and it wasn't a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has been consuming news drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream soon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...

... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angels\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the renaissance it was a belief was developed that the the sheriff and we're actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the the heavenly thrown up

well who are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what
