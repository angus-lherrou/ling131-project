you have had a a wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're going to have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nTo conform Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point in the mid\n... it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something that's interesting that\nDeveloped out of Alaska Lisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically given I Would have been dead though to bring it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical to with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the\nWay they've been going about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office oh with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been a pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Africans seems like at least some might now actually be reconsidering\nHas taken a look at the most likely outcome here\nOr it looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and uh it we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process is the positive that can be gained from all this how many people\nKnew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks haven't known many I I mean even you and the student listener\nSomebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet particular\nUh that that man what he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person\nDefinitely a role model a role model that we could all point to that's ultimately what I think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in pain detention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's going to Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the right for priorities in the right place this is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how the Senate actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered if the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in\nAs we wait until approximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYeah there are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moments\nWe can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does it the right

gosh and then people would call me and they say why did you let them do that it's like I\nDid it and they knew better right course they didn't call me up to date 'cause she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right\nBut she as she was good with you she liked to you\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what had been made\nYou know [laughter]\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it would have power we usually over the top the second half hour\nIt seemed to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague nuts well no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming when you mean talking about why not love so we're on the phone spears like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh\nBut he really Clinton helped set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a I'm\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a missed barber stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big Valerie\nAre exactly and what she was classic at\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that\nIn James meets mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know rather than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it

home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possess during tricked or some some strange way it changed your personality\nI Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when goes was ... was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person\nDoesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped\nYou know work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what do you have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that

somebody's life Fifteen Years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what the on the idea of energies shopping or something I've noticed that ah in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way he did the ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from it\nWas amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably rather than an hour has friends come over the\nPerson I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around ... says otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck's just about\nLike a bar full of empires or something\nYeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was\nAn old dad gum seating bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the in the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward roads there's like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people when and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name police\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray him and I says yeah and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up\nAnd pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we have these dreams Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um\nWhere they're going to kill you\n[laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was\nWeird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt and our presence\nI'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI'm with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I don't you run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm a while it was weird\nYou gotta you gotta be careful lotta times you people get
