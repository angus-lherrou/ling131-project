was their plan but\nOn you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a a logical point of view what if George ... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark\nWhat if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate

they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps present the\nThat maybe now we humans are experimenting with stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them a few little nuggets of wisdom

mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a I shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day well you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night\nRight and so what happens in general we wanted them there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also enhancing this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert The hundred dollar in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles\nGo ahead you're with us no\nHe's not let's give John and Virginia Beach Virginia try hey John go ahead\nOh gosh I won't tell you the story that after they like in the nineties\nNow I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however that Nineteen leaders Middle East I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little showbiz pointed at church\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I just said you know anyway I ah I went I was late getting have so I had to sit in the back of the church was packed and services going on and all of a sudden I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the pushing the check and I looked up and it was my uncle had just passed away\nAnd and he\nTold me he said John or your car and I was shot at it and what to do and he again said jak don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up very late and what he was gone\nBut still I was ... and ... and so I got her at home with a friend of mine and next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait\nAnd asking ... bringing my ... and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and took over the keys full ... anyway he a\nGuy in my car when they pull that that ... hit by a truck and they they want to but they were extremely you know injured a threat I mean they had ... votes in mind that too\nBut I never told me like this and that was really like to see anything that is what I did tell\nTwo of my close friends and um I don't let it and not with the show they have the I guess you know up until now and heading into being\nIn the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to go out and he told me down and\nSaid you didn't carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThey ended in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I ever had anything like a safe steroids ghost you get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here and this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on but\nOnce you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nUh it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who pass over my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because he still Lorna\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations\nOn him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here and you know he was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that\nThat um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who were\nGoing to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in

I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mop and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really show theirselves or\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was\nI don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who\nGoes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people that they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon cause the full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they ... from what we understand no loans have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the hospital where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet in touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when when they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you\nFind that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife you see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly\nMeans the again at least here in the United states this is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nIn charge don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially at Ashville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive\nUm it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement with the north Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating fell on and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that ah I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your ability to get more and more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period after

point and I urge radio station\nTropical storm Michael picking up strength as it heads into the Gulf of Mexico I'm an Carrick Fox News this storm expected to become a hurricane tonight Florida governor Rick Scott speaking on Sunday\nAnd he writes the anti matter column which looks at\nFringe science and the paranormal for the online magazine he uses his experience in journalism\nAnd his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic math welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\n[noise] well the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd uh the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell I after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two uh it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music\nThere was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought\nOr the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um [noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories\nAnd I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went through the little big corn\nOh we're accustomed last Dan was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was haunted right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war\nAh causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some a theorist and also say that you\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nUse their own specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\n[noise] I think a consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't ... stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately ... uh recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certain\nAnd he wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nToday I declared a state emergency twenty six forty counties across the Florida Panhandle in big band in preparation for tropical storm Michael disallowed resources to

music more hunt and rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a\nGreat story of a ... yeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was a ... a professor\nAt occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that uh what he witnessed was a huge object that was pretty much just standing at setting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nWoman and they shot against the math you people ... ... homes yeah ... something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book math you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships you had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so\nMany activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um\nShips those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness there a shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow ...\nSure around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with um a a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there um and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those are and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book\nSo yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here goes and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies can maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of euro haunted rock and roll stories those ... those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stop like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\nWell there are definitely good stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few\nVideo anomalies\nWhen I'm when I Believe his brother uh believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they saw Michael Jackson walk behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson who claim to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so definitely a\nMichael Jackson coasts have been seen there are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think back in two thousand sixteen I'm\nHis Paisley Park has his recording

'cause he was was also interested in the cold did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold [laughter]\nUh you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's\nA philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the whole society in the ...\nSociety very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a cult theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of it is a cult groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit\nOf a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany\nUh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so\nThere were the wiccan in England who uh try to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings and the ... got together\nWith the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the\nAllied a new thought ... a movement those are a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved into trying to use spiritual techniques a cult techniques\nTo stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were\nA different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lotta people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions\nAnd then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\nWell the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh\nAnd uh you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a ... I came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising tool it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions\nSo that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician\nA person the witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces in the soil the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider was involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car um pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um uh he uh one race car driver used a piece in his car into car fell on them and I think crushed him to death [noise]\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four that crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were report it to be cursed in that I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again is starting in any Frank\nYou're back with you when you made any subject India I\nI I I think you know they had to pay some hard things at the uh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA place where people were murdered by by not a\n...
