to half of the women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're going to want us yeah oh excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh so\nWe're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just

some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nAll and all

what I mean he has little\nTiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper ... which is a ... and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean

history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that to our arts is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking out\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans\nAnd that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South America [noise] uh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil we we've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water\nIt it just it I don't know\nAm one of those always Mrs no guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I say what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north and the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children there for\n... heard that I don't like about one to\nMy concern although not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ...\nSomething like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that could happen but what concerns me as a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south at West because like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking in Philadelphia where\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shift ahead we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada\nArizona and New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it\nYeah it said I was in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said what is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what is it one more big into\nYou know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started [noise]\nYou know what ... does is gonna be a huge\n... it's going to be off the charts what's the same thing that's happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market shoot\nOff the charts huge can't believe it it it said for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nWill show ...

first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and I've always had it on\nAnd the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things and have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally\nPut these all these experiences together into a book and a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family others but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously or or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get\nAn early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother\nThat uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou'd only as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal the paranormal they and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo ah to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's the chief scientist ions good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of\nAt Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's need all of this other GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the JBC Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast use out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI ... I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just had a ... it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building tonight and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's gonna spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce all sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience so this this initial experience I had at age four\nKind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner ah because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which they do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep\nAnd I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and um between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and ah it\nI felt like it it it was an end jelly presents it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing\nSo I can write to see 'em there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nOr there was no bridge you had to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my my mother's mother\nRobert Ballard

the way that it\nThat is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and ... things\nI I went to breakfast with my uh friends are just like the continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nOr the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but ah she she\nShe had the vision she was ah in in a city where ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this is the ... that people had since that and and I'm On a massive scale so which is\nAnd it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to love of the [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was younger\nUh ... uh camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips on the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my\nMom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card should look at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was and uh ... well above chance we would get the the suit\nRight we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face\nCard a very often we get we get it a right to the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical\nCarpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with\nThat and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from its ... it wasn't for my dad I got the storytelling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the red woods high\nThe way there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's\nVery ... and as I was making I think\nIt was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but\nIt was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and uh it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said\nI I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive and I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going and\nUh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy taking a big chance\nBy stand right on the on the edge of the highway and the

and almost stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've\nI've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a um [noise] in\nOur region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly where my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me and\nAs we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard\nThis a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nSo funny and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and\nShe you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of\nComforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre it would be weird when it yeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't\nQuite sure at that time I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal in and of itself that the college let me do it but ah well then you have to fight for\nIt I didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not\nLike for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nUh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the\nCourse into the course um and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment\nWhere we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun a\nThat's a hunted and I'm so that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the two ... where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that are in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho couldn't he says the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you\nI was the uh um the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a\nLot of these things happened in

it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed it was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving there was just the stuff on the night stand there was\nPresident Trump for the first lady said to visit Pittsburgh ... people were killed in a mass
