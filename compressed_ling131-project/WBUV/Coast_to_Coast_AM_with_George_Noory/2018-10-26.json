unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii define planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine\nAnd he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week\nAnd this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so\nYes there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California\nAstronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing enough direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto\nAnd real planets sometimes people say oh this new plan of nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solutions to\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nOr any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my senator Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition is\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like not to we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold have any close up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely pros and\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter later you're it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we know don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where the border we thought was nowhere ... sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite

knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme key they become much more common in the future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nations the United states included my adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming but\nUnfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we showed it has for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more and more\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it is a terrible future if we can get this under control and one

in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of the computer is sharing you win\nThe general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on three category\nFirst had it with the very distressing subject how cat had a cat\nAround the world like\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or had hacked into the observatory computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base\nThat's down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience on September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\n[noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies them I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of the parents to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nUh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facilities and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with you stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was\nIn this dark bedroom it was luminous and I could see light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling\nIn slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was just\nRaising the fascination of I didn't know what you're saying and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glimpse passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all being answered at the same time like all of these answers coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell him possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead\nThey were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head and I can see ... but they had the same texture in the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were living in is it the same time and they would just float by me but kind of neat\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like an downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was beginning\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was just super human\nGenius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subjects in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin very white pale and said she couldn't

know we're going to have I caught but uh it's a fun holiday and I love kids [laughter]\nUm but I think the night [noise]\nTonight I've been trying to share some of the more serious slices related to the issue of what might come back into this dimensional existence a after a death of sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coast audience\nAn example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication to the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I have been receiving these various categories having to do with out of body\nOr what the fog is and here I Want to read this\nCame just a few minutes ago listening to a coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still on the news do not live there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door into the laundry area hallway adjacent back door\nI saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up it went through the door\nI did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends\nI Am an open minded conscious oriented person\nBut immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color I would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house may have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the word smoky fog until you offered them\nOne night and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to the love the cat that I lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering could it have been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body they gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive\nOn my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you\nNever know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this charge\nNo I haven't had something like that these are magnificent stories emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people objected similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah humor little\nYes and the profound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may and one of my uh end of November coast I think it's going to be\nWith at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question is it the very soul\nLeaves the body how could that be if it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it that\nIs moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences I have never told a single human being in\nMy life and I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six do remember an out of body because that is significant where\nWas the learning there was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul and I knew body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you got to make sure you follow up for this virus or you know children but it's like\nYeah the polio or something like the polio in November I Will so I probably will be related to out of body these incredibly profound testimonies\nA and that is a from this ban and there's a whole bunch more I can see that I'm getting tonight\nThey keep rolling in doping yes\nAnd people who have seen this and go to my earth files report look at the looped videos that I have\nOn the October ... through third or it may it's very clear I Dr ... third and then the second Luke video is October Seventeen look at them look at this strange extraordinary thing twice\nThat it's come into the office\nI have not felt anything negative\nI Do think that people who have been saying that it falls more likely in the category of a loved one loved animal\nSomething coming back and then the issue is what would be the conditions in the matter world that we live hand and all of our busy knows\nWhat would be the conditions that would provoke something that is pass into another dimension to do the energy or whatever is necessary to come back into the matter world even if they are appearing as foggy smoke\nWhich she ... planet X again in the ... ...
