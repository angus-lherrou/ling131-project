Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water grade in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the president's so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency as if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to um hey thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley your role he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction acreage of cars much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that regret otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm listening a liberal media today because they think drop last night violated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker didn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... member of the eight twenty sixteen\nAnd I might not accept the election since the election as Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election and aren't haven't they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication that things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as the sec\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nIt up all this as abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nOr I'm with you and I also did tests that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAnything good every bit as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries\nHe tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it right I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today Sharon we got her run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania is Chuck

least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut down the social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose a security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts let's\nCheck in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead warned\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform is it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of they currently found out about this ... months ago\nThey should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about\nA month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime\nAll of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there that Google's commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place\nAnd that's the time at ... at the end at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear snapped jabs going broke where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a walloped\nYeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of messages to the troops to kind of ... tried to cheer them up [noise]\nUh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nUp there that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know you you can live off the ball and you and you could really a fall flat later on whether or not snapshot steps that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh uh the star of of the moment like they were some time ago\nPoint thanks Lorna appreciated up next an end the upside

thinking\nMark ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect suggesting that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people\nAnd ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent ones over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once as heroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this\nPart of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world that people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event that we know\nA producer heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically at a at a single moment\nThat we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened\nBefore the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but the the ... believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle ... be taught\n[noise]\n[noise] well I've heard of of food and bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller then and there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but the documents suggest that\nStudies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your

Callahan Fox News hurricane Michael very close to a category for hurricane strength\nWill get there we're going to be right on that border line but it is going to be a powerful storm either way likely making landfall we're looking at it and maybe new into one o'clock timeframe still a little bit of time for this to move a little bit but think lunchtime early afternoon when landfall will be going to a really become a reality Fox\n\nWalking back mark over with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nYeah I'm Glad you brought up short they're really really important one because if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond the nation perhaps it gets up in a window into a reality\nTypically don't see with our eyes but I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as ... active cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest there were ... and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patients in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing him he's dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce grace in his one person in particular who\nIs look at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets the theory that\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot damage\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut ... Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist anti materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease and uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing your lab already know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about psych medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded the Xanax her aunt antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nFact chemically the brain\nAnd their work they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is for the headaches the going back to ...\nIt can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious of the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and that type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nCan't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's a simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise] imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it\nMore as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience\nIt's not the producer of consciousness when\nWhat do you think mark of reincarnation\nWhile I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children\nUh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing a man or sometimes there if I buy medical records\nBy the UCA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life yes\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On

about them now the name of the book by wrong collected Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the you know the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nShoes communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adults say on says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years\nMore he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this point to Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYes uh I Know as you're reading\nThat I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nSomething about Lori Cabot the official which a simple\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is salmon and feel often when I was\nYounger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents for a person and ... at\nThe time people welcome are rude open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question see you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town\nAnd Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of these and then it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic ... medium that means we're talking about way back to your family you said the civility what year who did it start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought the girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talked to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nReadings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted\nHer city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing\nThat I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was\nMaybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique about what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm above the earth's anyway\nNow you've been with the New England new ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter and a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would\nFocus on but it's a team of individual that you know over the years I've\nLearned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee why look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] terrified as birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says\nWe've done more than a hundred and investigation is\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers\nAnd know that you know it doesn't always happen on command um so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on on if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their life\nWhat have you concluded about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes jar\nYou think they are\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nYou know do a closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put

... separated me from the other one and the other one talked marina as we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted more rain and come back alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fair was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the logic of the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more of a piece of equipment a\nSmall cage the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... and being\nYou might bring more video equipment are and like thermal or ... whatever\nBut you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the ... um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies according according to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the word no visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a judges that they weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions when I Do these goes to his own board of directors of Bush will cover White House so we do these hard to toys and one time we were in the um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you and sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman\nA walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the ... you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I it's her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is with the coast got it because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes on ah what Iowa lighthouse in that pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on\nUm renovation at that time it was sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen I serve a dog will crush the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nIt was founded outside jumped up and we'll rent the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says right would you see that's just that's our dog she says to describe it sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die white housekeepers afterward took care of him till the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nThe study of the dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean is\nTwo things that I'm really

nothing dumb from four to nothing\nThat would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of them so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of tickling area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena or in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for like a robot or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it would what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house ... something we're not going to do it without you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call ...\n... um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life and I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next coming or being a lot better hopefully\nThings starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes it was um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right\nUm and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm pulling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day we change are really trying to put on a mask but you're not\nFeeling it is that correct or no [noise] uh right [laughter] yeah okay right\nSo put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you up and go to person it feels like a lot of people are the ones that come to you when they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there\nYeah yeah okay so you need to know that you know you have\nTo have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron in marine the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter]\nIt doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I'd say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably busy constantly\nMaureen what do you think of ...\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't think that's\nSomething to be afraid of them I just think it's the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not\nAnd you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using and we'd be
