fun show we're going to honor\nOkay thanks to okay so let's open up the first secret door\n[laughter]\nI tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell not in my ... a month oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton reading a mortgage stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed I guess [laughter]\nI I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the male hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend look guy heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December I Can't believe it two months of out going anywhere\nAh against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little slipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo I stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word against it looks like they're about one point six planets per star opera galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star at all so that\nMeans one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place and you know and that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much types and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example\nAh it can get ... hours we also realize that a country a sixteen fifty I guess a visual Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right can't be too many things around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things\nThe ultimate you know her family [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here\nBecause apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result them\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out as saying but a very thorough and some of that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand that you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point search finance for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets or\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand pilots you know if there are life out there and we see it\n... you know they would make contact and the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig or or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so a motion was learned that it's more complex place for them we thought it was and we have to\nThe minute but you know what we're not the most advanced and much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter]\nNo ... and so\nWhat we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know a little bit\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work uh we take them leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature but it appears to be close to what it is\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've

now see my God I was in the summer school how my dad wrote an essay about it\nAnd then he got kicked out of them are Jane all your other one in the ass I again on the side of the nation\nThat was the one the car by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other and the power and there was another in the past there was only four I remember right well\nNo I I remember governor calmly and his wife Fagan act are as well because personally governor Connelly with hit off with one of the bullets well\nNo you're right the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where was ah were was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\nThe but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third Meryl\nStreep there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife\n... well you well you know now when you said you know by the con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got hit but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been a now they're sitting there and then the\nDriver early or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker down Tom and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over and what you're describing Kennedy back with his wife right and a hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a Congressman Frank I don't see a third row of seats\nI didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either bell thanks top okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor primary and his wife and his wife was to his lap and the president\nAnd Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt's true and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had to have been left and that if that's the case and also\nHe's driving so that means he'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make the perfect shot you know with this last pan\nAnd everybody wants to see that yeah so I you know I don't buy that\nOne every with Bill thanks for being behind the secret door you've given us a whole lot to think about when the new book comes out get back on the program

few different directions one as many people believe that the idiot motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles it through the power suggestion is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... them that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plants at the moving spell out messages\nThat's amazing work the way that happens in ...\nThe amazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combined together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plans to move and for that for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe
