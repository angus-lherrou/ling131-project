friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the ... which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've cross this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to boring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that origin\nOwn group or their motto was try that that just one word try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little\nGroup outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world Thomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to\nConstruct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether Edison ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experimented with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause it if I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side him to do some of ... the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they

activity\nMysterious things occur when people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experienced it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt it seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out or an old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to you quicker than you think\nJust expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent but sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list\nCarry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive expressed thinks that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't that once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing and the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television and narrating and and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that are protesting myself I Would never ask somebody to do something\nThat I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this

it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we put something out of a ... and that kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it\nSomething won't work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one\nAbsolutely definite cheap aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all and\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal facilitate all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with\nOne chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes in the mental healing tradition of things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are striving for all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of\nBelieve in ... and ... yeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five\nDays on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollar\nRegimes in the ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend you truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what the experience and it was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know one\nYes yes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visits extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and cognizant state just before we fall asleep at night\nAnd then act in image in your mind enact a scene that's something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb a ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder to climb climb you know really feel those rungs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back\nIf you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it your assumptions harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin your when Clinton township Michigan Hi Joseph go ahead\nI

even a yacht for that I heard a lady and a a a lot of how well you\nWell good for you where they do happen Mitch don't think\nThey do happen and it's also very important that we pass things on you know what we wish for other people rebounds to us because in effect you know if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great\nOver mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called at the oversold Newtonian he'll called an infinite mind in a sense once we've determined that the mind is extra physical we determined that we're all\nConnected that separation is just illusory so what we wish for others were in effect wishing for ourselves and it is at a depth to the phrase pay it forward\nFor some color Sharon in Sioux Falls South Dakota is with us now good morning sharing go ahead\nAnd

bumped gum and I love it I get a truck driver cold is one day Mitch and he was dozing off while driving his truck a around the very curvy area where you know like the sign of a cliff\nAnd he said he woke up and he was going over the cliff in just then hand\nPull his steering wheel back onto the road and saved his life is and then he said Georgia's nobody else in the cap I don't know what that hand was your word came from but yet it to me it's a miracle\nYes it's it's it's absolutely extraordinary whatever the the causes whatever those circumstances is extraordinary that the challenge that we face as how to remember these things every day because what happens is\nWe become extremely forgetful this is where we doubt that our thoughts affect reality because we have a thought or we have an extraordinary occurrence and then we forget about it\nSo the challenge to each one of us and every ... listener becomes when something like this happens to you how do you get up every day and remember it and not slip back into complaining or\nTaking life for granted that's the challenge that we face in life\nLet's go to the keys in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nI yes I have several questions
