to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... ... talking with then ran for then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets ... gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nBut that like the fun ones and and I like when people dressed up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean really do you do people really you know you\nAre the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened it\nOccasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off\nAnd actually the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't\nYeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the\nWhole thing is just silly now my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look to the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so that you can see all the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money isn't always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials may have clean they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nA court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror you'd actually\nYeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ...\nAnd what you find is that uh the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff\nSo you know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade caution that really creative and not just you know do something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so\nHow do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future\nOf Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a good question you know I think that um you know\nFollowing mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit um\nAnd I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who knows like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid what eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years from now\nA ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual go you know where you\nGot like holy crap [laughter] do you get to that because that was the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their seat

am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about\nThat let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house you know reach out and grab the crow somebody or whatever and it's the only thing that some of that but\nBut you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if he drinks on when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a season and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at accidents twenty two Eighteen\nYou know thou shalt not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned\nRightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up every\nEvery year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm an role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owner\nOr so so concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is\nUh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... motion that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so they they the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights in the\nAh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was the wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to ... just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bar mine either right away I Am\nDoing those huge freeze those have you ever had um frozen ... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back\nOh man I Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably watch in the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that cell or say hey you guys are going on there now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element is some people they don't you know their

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on your audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we ... we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field is actors and the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science or in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think girls are cool [laughter]\nI think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find\nThem improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but what ... what is it well\nYou know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that's that's you know of course that's that's the million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hunters unbelievers across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen there was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and tree the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is\nProblematic for ghost research right because goes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nFor windows for Willis ... thank you for getting the information\nYou had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get a cute but are coming up we're going to be talking the where will in London so

u._k.\nOut there right now early morning for him and we're talking about basically the where will serve London the links to where wolves\nIn particular and uh if you go to our website there's some really great sketches from some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what we've seen and we were just talking previously with Paul about the uh werewolf that we've seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches DePaul did by the way he's an artist as well just\nJust when you see when you see it coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses\nNow POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter and so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the ... ... this\nCattle grazing it's look slum where they'd be in the old so to lake but around much in the sediments and everything is produced sort of fertile ground very fertile ground but yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race officers in it you know that\nIn ... in the Nineteen\nSeventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded is citing the you know\nAnd he did it a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and Robin since ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um it was a place called Fox ... in written Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks them and he still lives in ... I mean it's an interesting story\nIs that it was witness friendly suddenly noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy with my roommates net to catch the rubbish and the has the other game small game\nAnd his words the ice is proper sort of Burlington type born and bred in his words pretty well ... as\nYou said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing he said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so two rows of its own as you're looking over to was the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime and there's a large hedge hall forums and things about he said he probably eight to ten ... so I mean what is sort of turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and he's peripheral vision and looked and saw it\nOn the left over the head ... he said what he thought he was a U hauls he meant halls so hate older bless each other for a while you'll also just\nCouldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is the biggest thing was as big as a small pony or you you know your house\nIt's an interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait experts a horse to lend to move forward because the momentum this thing just limited and stuff like a magnet sudden\nSomething not to be nice to look at that\nHe said it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he says he's glad the before run away he said but he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it's the the stood up to there being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said you know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you vote terriers\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went on to the edge to them to try and get sentenced Dave is just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world or\nWhat quite incredible\nUm you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beach the bombs to drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd this was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a ... going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go for the the coast you got\nOld folklore legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven ... they took they took the pop salt and\nDon't have to come down I'm Down in time\nI think the grains of truth in the story so that was the right thing in the Nineteen seventies and he lived in life\nAnd it never seen it\nHe's never seen it before and they never seen it which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe the story about this thing was to that you would think it'd be more evidence so why are we only see smoke glimpses of it he was in a mate\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's in a remote viewer in I Would have heard target Bigfoot and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she just looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they have these portals\nAnd they were in time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where a human would see him um I find I find it also interesting\nUh when you were saying that Ari yes is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy\nStuff happens and I think I remember seeing a picture\nThat might be my phone about a coup so people just it's cutting in and out no well is showing no actually it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this job and to hang up and you got me about this sort of you know well\nWell you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange that this operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nGoing in June June ... jumping to them and why the automobile tuitions rate which is eleven miles from stuff like that one close that won't close about Seventy\nSixty eight but he was still operational softly so to and from the edge you know the audio them oh they're\nOkay now he's gone [laughter] so it will definitely contacting back on one of his other phones that he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out\nUm ... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that\nI don't know I don't know you'll always on the story [laughter] we'll\nJust wing continues here on coast to coast am I'm Connie Willis and we've got Paul Sinclair is our guest we're and talk more about the ... where Wolff and other things too that are creepy and then I [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nYou never won for building

K. you can't get close to these cliffs\nA you know I'm not saying that that's where these things in happy valley is just an angle to look at the\nBoats I'm staying quite close to flex than Connie and twelve miles away there's a huge area of would love to know if you're in North Yorkshire called ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes sort of set in the trailers and doing what oh well all you guys are ... women girls as well with doing a good so to ride around the woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big for type ... is nevertheless an interesting story or late evening still light\nOn the ... the ... about four foot high and there's all trees all around them as the recycling down these parts\nOf the ... mountain became aware and shouted tuition says can you see that they said about forty four away from them that on the path in the ... and moving that going down ... down these hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says will cry because he didn't appear to be ruining\nAnd the the that black fur covered very big uh you know what I think we're talking like over eight feet tall a well like the ... before it's all in the city for four to ... votes at least\nAnd these things they described it says like it was on a track your ... you know they couldn't see legs and they said they were living up around how Dale they were familiar with most of the\nThe ... the phone or on rocks and an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches and rocks for this thing ... was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken\nAs though it was just fixed Reggie ... he says when we were going as fast as we could cause us at the front and he says hell yeah they said we were absolutely terrified\nBecause they were keeping pace with us and it was looking after that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nWas look it was fixed on them so is it eventually we go to the ... which faults off to the left and to the right to sudden we went right sort of choosing the path that will take them first away from this thing and they left it that's all the scene of it [noise]\nIt yes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys that they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nOr with the amount of detail that this this month so if they're given my\nBook I think probably Coney we're looking at more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the he's not running in the way the conventional way we would expect something to ruin all moving should I say you know\nIt's an ... you know it's it's\nWe just got to go for a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this\nAnd say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of us is there's no word that really work in our language for what this is so hard to describe the scene and are these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves\nLike you just can't put into words whatever's going on there whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things when you put together I mean yeah we want to focus on the where we'll split\nBut when you put all his together in the area that you are there are so many things that are going on\nIn his radius ... again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there there was a picture that you had\nThat you sent me and I guess it's been one of your books that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening that went on some sort of a den\nAnd that were seen and then the next day or maybe within the same hours of it there's this like vehicle\nAnd it's got some sort of satellite dish on it\nAnd it's going up to this guy I mean after these events news this vehicles there\nThat the county you're you're talking about something that we saw in on July the twenty fifth or twenty seven thing to just if we if we may just jump from the ... for a moment he's yeah sure\nThese vehicles I've got a phone call from a guy called David hind\nAh lives in the village of ... and he said Paul I think you really need to go and look at these vehicles out and I did just that I took a camera I got pictures of them and they were the drums and they had a huge green books on the back with a radar dish on the top [noise] um I'm trying to do this ... going to cause I'm realizing you might want\nMe to talk with the way we can take your time\nAnd put behind that was a huge trailer which we now know how to ... or a generator which would top to now the license plates with German a ... on the the units themselves was American\nThat in an area the little known this script village called them some\nOf the pack so I'm Blake Hounshell lane Blake how Blake can bring relief to them slumber to them and do you mean black they say something Blake choice black how blackberry amount lane he's just so happened a few weeks before I got photographs of triangular impression the period in a ... crop that somebody told me about\nOn black Halloween [noise] on the twenty fifth of July when these vehicles will see and um they stayed weeks by the way they weren't
