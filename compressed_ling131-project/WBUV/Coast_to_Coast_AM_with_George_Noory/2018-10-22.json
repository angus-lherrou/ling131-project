for having me a\nAbsolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading\nAbout all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about um something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it was the wild man and\nI hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago\nWhen you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned and how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar and counter and they said you know if\nWe you have Twenty years of police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd according down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down from doors for me I'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nThe questions as we go forward number one how old they get to the U.

later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic

again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nLook back at the Patterson gambling film I and it's you know if people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned that has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much less\nSo when I did with ah the gambling film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on\nAnd they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad\nIt's in tribal Dick foot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different

like that you know from 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were sure they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on it for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and it ... I I have never heard of a hunter say\nOh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nMexican agents who briefly blocked them at the Guatemalan border Fox is William ...\nThe actual languages will offer safe passage to the immigrants that as the headlines in the afternoon vapor that we just saw a few minutes ago but he is guaranteed release told residents of Honduras Guatemala baby will offer them safe passage we saw a riot police earlier today they back down\nWe've seen maybe three five hundred cops here in riot gear you didn't have buses and go away\nThe migrants receiving help from sympathetic Mexicans such as food water clothing and rides and pick up venting cargo trucks taking aim at Mexico's Pacific coast hurricane Wilma a category for storm landfill as expected in West central and south western Mexico with maximum sustained winds of one hundred forty five miles per hour\nPrecipitation flash flooding storm surge in of course a very very strong wins or will be impacting ... probably expect uh the outer reaches of the tropical storm force winds are like laid off later tonight or early Tuesday Morning\nHurricane specialist Dave Robert is with the national Hurricane Center I head of the midterms Facebook is setting up a war room at its California headquarters to take aim at fake information Fox is Claudia ... was in the war\nWe got a chance to tour of this new war room which is actually a converted meeting space at Facebook's mellow park campus and we saw dozens of security experts in data scientists and engineers working around the clock to root out bad actors trying to mislead users about who they are and what they're doing\nFacebook criticized by Congress after Russian government linked operatives used the platform debate\nAmericans in twenty sixteen is Fox News\nThis is talk went on for now I didn't even [noise]\nSaudi foreign minister a gel I'll bear sat down for an exclusive interview with Fox has Brett there to explain why his government story keeps changing and the debt that Saudi journalist ...\n... to be the first step of the long term we are determined to uncover every stone we are determined to find out all the facts and we are determined to punish those who I was home schooled with this for the murder\nThe minister saying it was a rogue operation gone wrong a lot of police officers in the U.S wear body cameras now thousands in one of the country's largest departments will take them off the NYPD\nHas pulled nearly three thousand body camps off the streets after one exploded inside of Staten Island precinct early Sunday\nPolice spokesman says an officer noticed there was smoke exiting from the bottom portal and removed it immediately after that the device exploded the officer wasn't hurt the incident revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite\nThe company that owns the cameras are there working closely with the NYPD to investigate the issue ...

disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... an acclaimed documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book great Debbie here\nRight here or\nA Sarah like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAdd to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you know flash forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you\nKnow they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic well worth the story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive flu I get this email from this young filmmaker and Sarah ... well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part\nLenny theory than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand a\nBrother that we only the many theories on foot\nSo you're getting ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though very family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe a veteran who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that would definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nOr I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing craft from uh the ships took good troops on to the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalize version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of half an hour where your father drove the\nLanding craft and I'm\nThe weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she with his opinion the shore of environment and during that time and march very first Nineteen forty five she'll be hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty sick injured and that was what really that are on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two at the theater I'm Victoria\nAnd now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she

D board somebody\n[noise]\n\n\nSaloon Vincent I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use of ...\nUm\nWell it was it and then more sports that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men are hashing modus point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that Marines because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported\nThey were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and\nThinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen\nRats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into\nNow and thinking that that would string folk out well of course that didn't and then other when you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin coping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called hyper ...\nAnd bought that food for blood cell ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible death from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all the sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it it sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I get to see any kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know the gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he when\nWe're talking with Linda ... about Indianapolis

Pacific now almost a category ... storm on track to hit Mexico's west coast between Mazen lawn and Puerto Vallarta\n\n\nWind Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of dropped through the cracks that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mentioned there with the\nDeparture methods that didn't go through from gone to the Philippines there was a tenant I'm looking I had read the the thing that is a ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made\nOh he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and a as a matter of fact I had received a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals have combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and try to give these guys are the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left and your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to any of these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident\nSo the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil VJ Day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nThen maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating the ... in the streets split their family is now grieving that their son or their brother their uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify and turned her surname sick I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little is talking about the court martial of our mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in justify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he will do the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in command her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund\nAnd kept in Charles McVeigh was the only cap and he was court martialed [noise]\nExcuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of specific forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick\nWith Nick day and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who um heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned with failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese said commander\nAnd indeed happened make they did the stick as the ... at evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk but the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion\nUm and then one commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would
