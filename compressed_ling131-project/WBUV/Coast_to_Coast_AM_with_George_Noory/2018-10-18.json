often\nThan you would think George is\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's uh something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of

went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the\nThe fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent to you is child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the only good advice that I can give it to this point George is June borrow and if you have to borrow\nYour not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collector practices treated lending a state your three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections but I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow [noise]\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit or and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices are so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding et cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room OR Books um for a four year course for a four year college\nAnd by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat birth she they can't because there's there's a winning programs to anybody in the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to polish much dead on the actual students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but\nAlso really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cautious just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars and that\nThere was a story just recently where they see\nA guy walked out of school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all uh the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know at this really hurts the broader

my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine a and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall you know a a piece for which\nSallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nIn by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income\nPeople um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans\nAnd it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early as probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone on the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nGeorge I got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and laugh at it on the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they drop support sealed and he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway uh I I drive a little bit of traits will do\nA ... a day to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the conflict and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I looked at her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know their way\nSo I ended up going and less than ... dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that I could have done it for about half the price down\nLet's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the\nGordon and Lakeland, Florida Gordy go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages credit card lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college did\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the\nPresident says he has asked turkey to share the audio recording which they claim proves the Washington Post contributor was murdered in a city council it in Turkey newspaper will be paying tribute on Thursday\nI Want to find out what\nThe Washington Post publishing a spinal column from ... in it he warns that the Arab world is facing its own iron curtain in costs were free expression writing quote the Arab world needs a modern version of the old transnational media\nSo citizens can be informed about global events that poses they held off and publishing column and hopes to show he would return posted or county or writing she had hoped to become together with him but adds quote now I have to accept that it's not going to happen this is the last piece of his I Would edit for the post\nFox's Sean ... the former presidents of USA Gymnastics has been arrested after a grand jury in Texas indicted Steve petty charges of tampering with evidence in the case of Dr Larry Nassar the former team doctor convicted of sexual assault involving scores of young athletes in baseball the games they've been catching the American league championship series\n[noise]\n\nFly at Andersen with a call on CBS as the Boston Red Sox beat the Houston Astros eight to six the Sox tickets three games to one lead and the American league championship series earlier the Dodgers beat the brewers five to two they take a three games to two lead in the national league championship series [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nThis is news talk went on for now I'd be American astronaut who suffered through a white ... space capsule failed to reach orbit last week speaking out about the ordeal\nNASA astronaut Nick hang his it was the closest call at his career he went into a light on board of Washington so here's rocket and one of the boosters to separate for triggering an automatic aboard and\nThen I saw the booster failure light inside the capsule and at that point you know I realize hey we're not going to make it to where I'm at today\nAt that point he says his training kicked in he knew he had to stay calm and ...\nAnd after two years of training in Russia in ... he was missing control\nSneeze commander has not Alexi ... in Washington plunging back towards earth that you were suggesting the forces seven times the strength of our gravity before the parachutes popped open and their Soyuz capsule came to rest in a remote part of Kazakhstan\nFox is Christian Fisher it's setting a sentencing day on Thursday\nFor former FBI agent who admits he leaked documents to a reporter Teri ... will be sentenced in federal court in Saint Paul Minnesota or an authorized disclosure of national defense information prosecutors are asking that he get a minimum of four years in prison a Florida Man is going to prison for targeting target\nThis goes way beyond short selling fifty year old mark Barnett a prosecutor say wanted to bomb target stores to drive the company's stock price down has been sentenced to forty years behind bars turns out that are purchased options on target stock that would pay out when the share price drop\nYou off at a confidential source ten thousand dollars to place homemade explosive devices disguised as food packaging store shelves from Florida to New York\nBest to get a spouse bomb making materials at Barnett house devices were turned over to law enforcement by the informant Barnett arrested\n...

my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Alan RT scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in default that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loans\nUh and make a commission off of that so I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of a growing pose a telltale\nHa that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never\nDeal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is non to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with their third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise] so\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've\nNever heard from them again well\nYou have to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and in\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shy and\nPromise [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed

aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to\nTo try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for any relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't die if the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know how the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you know like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then this this walk strong guy and then this this ... million at businessmen\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this I when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon what I did cite teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... this thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know you had it all ... headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure from me it's a completely\nNew role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a ... a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nI as I say really to try to\nTalk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to all the platforms that the young people\nYou watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food to and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject no not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since termed along had his press conference where he\nTogether with the ... people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times ran than story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite\nYes and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you said I I'm beginning to feel is the momentum is waning what do you\n... when when you say the organization um he\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this the U.S government has had voted always says\nThese sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nStill has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nFox is rich and sort of the state department Turkey's government claims to have graphic audio recordings which they say prove cause

when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nWe coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services committee have been looking for is the ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy Farrah I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space sub committee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think he will be difficult to get it away from the military frankly hit with a a military and intelligence program and I just don't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference\nAbout unconventional threats will if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's a lot so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I've certainly set that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think it is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far there have only been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know what all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNo among us one us no not yet\nNo no thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster is also doing what they do to

freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with a million of penned again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes running your own documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published\nIn the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\nYeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty [noise] in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course off off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my

of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO\nBusiness or at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the one thing of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nUh Poland a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for six\nAnd ... part of the blue book system so so in other words the clue with there all along that that you ate he reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long how many years\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British government's UFO
