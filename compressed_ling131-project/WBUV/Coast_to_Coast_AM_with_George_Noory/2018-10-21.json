experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think\nThey wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and having them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his\nMuscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find these people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know if a on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to\nPull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task\nOf of uh yeah this\nWriting on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would you I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet his good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um\nBut eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break\nFriendship after a couple of years it was the oil's why\nMexican

the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nI think it was about [noise] a couple of years after the say on he was in a really bad car accident\nHe was with his sister eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to morphine a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secret to his own that\nYou're kind of breaking up on us Thomas or I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ...\nThis is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for this ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts it cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nKnow and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement\nAt the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be a little lost um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry in in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working you know hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you sure chose the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar to the time that Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we were before on\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about that rate for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... million\nFDR it seemed to ... and reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack\nWell Hitler violated the act and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional\nDictator if the if this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to go do it so\nStyling is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little\nA little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was Turan in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the posts\nWorld a instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty

Long Beach California John good morning\nThanks for having me real quick to thing\nWind or if you look at a at Roosevelt a nightly quarter for you look so bad I have a hard time thing that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may Truman to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you know the lip\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this I was fascinated with tall and how I got away with all this stuff when Roosevelt died dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently and make sure that uh let's see if he was he was calling because I'm Stalin did a lot of that\nAnd I think it was for the story was that it would require you to ... he wanted Roosevelt ... rate them over the cold that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of tournament I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I think he did not want him that he wanted to live longer they possibly that's just my my take on it\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh but just because he he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was his lowest forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know lived to be in I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nHank rancher thank you for taking my call\nMy players the\nIdea that did pont originally made their money to the science trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller\nAh started out our lighting houses with kerosene that find that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct then\nThat can End Days ran they got down these guys\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue\nTo crush across [laughter] really interesting\nStuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from summer\n[noise] um and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain

did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start\nBecause you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books\nAs you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to\nSay back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in the abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd that you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't add any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA joy ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as and they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nWhen that county policing Maynard remains at large and his considered armed
