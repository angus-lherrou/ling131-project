New York stock exchange\nWhich is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nThat as a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son signed ... in general the next year or so uh by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus isn't Scorpio and it's a ... I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year\nSo those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is focus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know have the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking where you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere\nAnd I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me ah back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one and you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in\nThe nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nI'll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising and the son is in Capricorn at the\nBottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's\nComing up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but son with Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand nine team for the world\nWhy does it work more why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was when the old idea ... and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words if everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the inability of course\nYuletide it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that history they're taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually use for the Americans chart because it was a first\nBreath were were thing gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various on it it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in a moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month stay in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it your noon is at sunset is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most the ... are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been with the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing find which was signed rise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah in this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't Thirteen I was

his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet earth great which is very powerful and often underrated was in the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince ... since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going to medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have studied medicine in college at Michigan State\nI didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first day of the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was\nBorn I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes LA oh and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to that phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was\nFoolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these ... nations Persia Egypt Rome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay worn out one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know am I what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and\nBelieve it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\n[noise] yeah a lot of a judge how are you\nGood luck on the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I ... that you know two great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nAh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other lives particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nA lot you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on\nUm go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology\nThe power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise] you know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology\nThere was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic Lee people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart we're looking\nAt the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're they born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nNo no no ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibration they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi I was born in Cleveland, Ohio by the way

M.\nI thought it was am this was a pie and Marie I'm Carla on you know oh sorry well that's an okay no hair\nBear with me Carla finally you got something wrong [laughter] to me yeah I didn't hear one and then ah that's okay but Capricorn\nYou know this is I Know so many people born with Capricorn so um my mother was a January eleventh baby so uh [noise] anyone born around ... eleven January twelve you know so you know a lot about that that vibration so one of the things\nFor Capricorn again is Saturn is there okay uh do you know anything much about astrology yourself miss wherever that yes\nOkay so ... I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of a link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy\nAuthors were ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes we've been nurse or a doctor were were a student or you\nKnow a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSome kind of deep seeded study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really vote and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may poor Nineteen sixty nine may for Nineteen six\nThe nine or going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different state or on the way I was born in ... city court\nThey know where are you okay what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in Kuwait a scholarship and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or know annoyed okay no problem okay you said money\nAnd where what state to live in which they deliver you Jim Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individual\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you if mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you Mercury's in its home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh see I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on that note when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously and not overwhelming the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve and New Year's day to get

Chesapeake Bay\nAnd I was sitting there late at night when I saw a larger delight heading toward me there was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake\nThen I noticed the outline of a large dissed shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me as it flew over me I saw bottom panel open and the UFO spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany rows straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home

came until the night cap offers about Nineteen\nSixty seven or thereabouts as a matter of fact my wife and Marty and I were there at the time and uh he came in and uh just introduce themselves we didn't know who he was and he never said\nHow I became interested in it a\n... at that time at least and is he asked to see a cases he said that he had gotten interested in was wanted to investigate some cases and uh so he went back into our files and spend most of the afternoon back there and then came back and think this than the left and then\nHe started coming into a Washington on a fairly a fairly regular basis even had to come all the way from Arizona which is where he uh he was he a atmospheric has this at the University of Arizona at the time\nUh up until his death actually and uh\nHe just a\nBegan staying at our home overnight in Bethesda, Maryland and uh whenever he came in and we stay up 'til like four o'clock in the morning sometimes matter of fact he put us all to bed and itself yet amazing energy\nIt not only eight or send us vote it was interesting things like table type thing and and dividing outside in in the yard\nBut um he uh it it just got interested I don't know what really\nUm um [noise]\nWhat really is interest was at the very beginning I I don't remember that he may have ... you may have told us but don't forget this than almost fifty years ago now\nBecause he committed suicide in Nineteen Seventy one\nAre you sure he did I mean there was a suicide note and everything but how do we know he wasn't just you know gosh murdered\nWhile he told us are doing or his last visit there it was\nIt after he left our our house after staying there a I'm a overnight a and it was it wasn't that long a month maybe too before um his body was found we didn't know that he suffered from depression at the time\nYou you didn't show or did he\nKnow it didn't show it at all and it's hard to believe and even told us at the time that he had been followed\nA buy 'em on Martin vans didn't have a license plates or something on them a ...\nThroughout the ... and around Phoenix\nAnd he also said at one point that ah he had a um [noise] some UFO material and um it was flying a plane\nAnd or an of black briefcase which he laid down on the on the seat um or or or or or he lay down that popped up against the seat the briefcase was\nWhen he went to pick it up it was empty somebody had exchange\nSomebody briefcase way the exact same looking briefcase\nAnd uh he said that he had been a said followed around by an unmarked vans\nAnd I'm scared I'm a little bit but he is he's still and and that last visit he said that he was ready to began writing his book and just as they said that a\nHuman asking about a month later he was gone shot him so they say that that's what they say yeah\nHe has done a small grants from the office of Naval Research you opposed and he\nDid he did I think it was a five thousand dollar grant or ten thousand\nWhich is pretty good money back in Nineteen sixty seven\nYeah back in those days it was it wasn't bad that's correct yeah yeah but uh he had um and actually Andrew I helped Andrew grateful uh quite a bit and writing the book I spent many hours at her home at our home back in the mid nineties\nAnd when she wrote firestorm and she did a tremendous job on bringing McDonnell back to life\nAnd uh but she uh I I I told\nHer that that that\nMcDonnell had these little black I'm sort\nOf had that he would write on meant as a and they've code after that\nAnd um and then people and and keep 'em yeah the thing is that that a ... right yeah and and the thing is that a after he died nobody could find those little black pads here that even as a wife\nThat see a either didn't know about them or or didn't know where they might have been\nHe got into an argument with Jay Ellen Heineken on the two of them really gotten close after that we're ... we used ... withholding project Blue Book information and I agreed he said he said a highly ... words were\nIf I had really disclose what I knew the air force would have fired me and I would basically been out of a job\nThat's correct as a matter of fact he slammed his fist down on a ... when I spent the day with Heineken and uh and and ... have they brought that up\nBecause I didn't think it was fair of ... but but uh I think it later years a valet began to understand I make more and of course he wrote a really nice um um thing and and ... book about McDonald\nClassy kinda\nCompared them is to really um scientists who were you know got a bum deal at at the at the end because a lot of people just wouldn't believe them\nWhat is your gun 'til you Gordon Bob McDonald duty commit suicide or do you think somebody rubbed\nMy gut tells me that a
