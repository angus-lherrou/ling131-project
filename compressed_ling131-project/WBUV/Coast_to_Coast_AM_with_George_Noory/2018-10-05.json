ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are four walling they would they would buy the theater out\nYou know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a

think right now and that just trying to balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how did that I thought\nWell I started when I was a rebellion heading in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with being somewhere I shouldn't have done what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time at the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit\nBy a drunk driver room my body a\nMotorcycle and um I had a real tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air land\nYou know on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggested any way that consciousness is more than just our physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLeg you know now I have to start the legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience noodles experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in pure assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen\nTable\nAnd you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and\nAlmost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong I\nGuess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights a war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was to lure Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis or Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident uh-huh you're born heights\nReally yeah well you told me where cars you must remember the the the street oh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over are we going to\nI'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes\nYou'll remote dealing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear miss viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back your my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you've got a PHD in social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the psychological shows you usually get into the but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view I've kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war in class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut regard and\nI didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in Georgia it's all that\nKind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... bill just like the beer right it is and he really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember\nRemember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really uh garbled up minimum yes well I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a than that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention you know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going\nForward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do baffles you were one [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really\nDo you believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nAnd just in some circumstances the media contributed that's a bias that none of you should be probably after a day of reviewing an FBI report detailing an investigation of sexual misconduct

A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack Dr Merrill Lynch let's with us Marilyn in this reality courtroom how do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife after death\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people had\nExperiences that give them a sense of that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know\nBeyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting things like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm you know they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions\nBut it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHarlem were younger people react to these things you know what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWhat's some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either\nGiovanni hey how's it going your roommate me when the war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness is absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth\nMore a wonder and and and and after you off into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mines that are just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forest or about the jungles it ended up being a form of consciousness or a of a of kind of a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of um of mysticism and and also a you know being able to travel into you know in three dimensional and and uh and explored the potential of the mind\nThrough um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me over time the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was probably Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly child would it'd be a black a jungle and the this this black jungle is just as an ocean jungle it's\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered\nI'm a lord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle like I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour into my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\nCalling out I mean it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit it's beautiful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into some out and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ...\nAnd the more we explore the more we'll find just like you said if we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to\nJust shrug it off and not leaving something is there\nWhat do you think of them are I Am so grateful for that comment on the question I appreciate your supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that\nMany traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process uh because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have this capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience\nBut it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von who uh is no longer in this plane of experience but she let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought if I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there was a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist and has really been looking at some of the\nDifficulties surrounding meditation you know we think about it always as a really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get into realms of experience\nThat they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and I keep exploring it's a great adventure\n...
