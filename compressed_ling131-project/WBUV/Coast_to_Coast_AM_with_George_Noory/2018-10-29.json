you know it's only been a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals were were found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that it's um you know there are

something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as the story you tell in this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so\nI Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland ... and\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they'd be coming out his window areas where it seems every fit and his brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had same this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use\nOver the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ... in\nThe sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know they said that she's a ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon but you know [laughter] I don't

something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was the fact\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWell I've got to be honest with you ... I mean I've done five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one on the women and black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live ... white white\nUm um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after paid for using wage of ... which puts in ...\nTheir angle to it um but\nThere's no doubt in my mind again um you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe fish but many black mistreat Bobby on you know just guys in a black suit walking\nI guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the kind of shows you know you've got a really weird and actually a couple and then some which are here to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black but you know but in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for them I think it's a very small gotcha great they genuinely unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed that elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might have within government you know that many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend them out hey\nAs a main too quiet April who may not want to I've been talking about cases so the government actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nLatest book uh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on alien abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or real life or documents that nicotine squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k. government that the outlaws take us into the break with maybe the greatest\nGhost story goes song ever written a ghost writers in the sky we write back [noise]\nYou access the audio archives of ... am log on to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nWork to build a house for nine cars this hour we'll give you something else about shall we talk going on for nine W.

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and say Israel eons but\nThey told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the abduction phenomenon in September sixty one a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd they subject to to um strange and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they ... they should become now to say the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like they\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down\nLights went out of his vehicle and then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something that ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because\nMaybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for following around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures gigantic numbers of books with salt I'm On a ski went on the ... it's a all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this\nSort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and I'm\n[noise]\n\nTwenty team victory march the fourth world series for the Boston Red Sox in the

book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he clearly a real one um they do seem to be tied to both ... and um the id and abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things that's as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of

religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality and on church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media in popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and\nCultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the variances and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real buff sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to normally Georgia's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to hear\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world\nI spoke about this but some other people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension of space that different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects as length\nIf you then draw last where on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and the the phone thing else has the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others from philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility\nLike kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um

sat in\n[noise]\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled but getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they ought to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat\nOf that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense is that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be\nA block universe universe that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it\nScott my book but you can also look at Brian Greene for he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so\nI'm done and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that you treat your moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more positive or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should start ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension dreaming up he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as an additional visual dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I get the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of

Seventy reached out and grab a simple as up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves\nInto our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that in and I'm an avid spoke a flat land so yes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal beliefs could coexist with a scientific ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nPeople who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book\nUm you know talking about\nWhat the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like the all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay W done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he\nDidn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to he went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different\nAll different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on and\nOn ... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat line and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of his two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat land we can see for the first time\nNot just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the try like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have uses the say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of everyone's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it\nI'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences from her parents psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... person and interviewed and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those\nExperiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book and that the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found is that people do use this kind of language\nA community
