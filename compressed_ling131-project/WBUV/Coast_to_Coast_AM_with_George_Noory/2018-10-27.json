we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the

Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think an elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she loves to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars in which she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and this is very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this when I was to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook\nBasically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that I walked me had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then download it on to a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like\nYou might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else [noise] I think it's\nVery real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example\nWell the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in

well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're nominate traits in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah I Know it's not like the mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets myself in the sun but he\nRecently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit\nCrazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control\nEverything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating well run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance that you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I play in every once in a while you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post or we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right to go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how ... easy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one no\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a called the trans human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nKnow of severely crippled and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are\nArtificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his car so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I and I was amazed and fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are\nEqually realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we stairs\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are\nThinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now in another escalating arms race right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we had our just still the same\nYou know sell our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of\nUnintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending some terminal but you know what I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but\nBut positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story\nAbout the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one\nOf those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now that this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are\nTurning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very

I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah\nThey they won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education peas and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the your schedule right are you going to be on the big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you\nYou were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the the mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more Callow\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse or you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible\nThat might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence bean whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky all is a a kind of a role of human like robot but gets so complex\nAnd so the non ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\n[laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nWord from saying or for the crush soul\nThe people it's dumped on an ... you know getting are going to get itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know that it's a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so\nJack Lew that after this exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity\nDegree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to David who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah they do we just leave them and we just left\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but um [noise] I've been on a kicking machine going on forty five years Yes sir\nAnd I was a banker degeneration I'd like you know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a a a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is

because we are not gosh that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with ya in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question and just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that\nUh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not listening for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a reviving manner awarded a habit of the things he could've tapped were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore in our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people story not first survival situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for senses\nFamilies with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are ... we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies which is ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Want her to the oil like two I'm following scare myself\nNot to a consuming somebody's supplies but just chew on myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give a trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even\nHis they themselves and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive that could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up in this case or

hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a drink and the and the Bible as something to be studied\nAnd pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is and the New Testament to the current estimate yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the ... all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stories in the Bible a mini that many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book uh Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as far as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nA settled in and you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the genius who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out to you I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far onto their way to create these structures were there shooting people

I'm interested in my book called the ... of Jesus yeah I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published or and or like you know eight um apparently with what they pay according to the production of ... it was kind of transcribe written transcribed by Levi Dowling would transcribe it from the uh caustic record\nAlso known as God for book remember if there's another way of putting it [laughter] I'm headed with this book because it is her little in many ways for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covers like that so called ... years of his life\nA highly ... ... years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that the full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus karma their price of the\nHighest in age and somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a not a conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers\nAnd I've had it with the idea of um the beginning of an age where they've got the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat and oh yeah ours is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes\nI think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or is this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we can never do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ...

amongst I think in the lead group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's great and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the

if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of him on my uh being very
