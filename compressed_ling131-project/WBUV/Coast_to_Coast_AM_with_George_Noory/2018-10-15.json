website more Gulf Coast dash deals dot job\nYou want people to think you're going to put on your ear bud said listen online they'll never know you are listening to the news talk going on for nine\nR D radio [noise] [noise]\nI've only counting of the great American thanks for listening and I didn't I was always a kick to have on the president and\nShare his thoughts with you and uh I understand is going to happen a more frequently or over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen\nAnd then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic\nAnd twenty twenty when I come from any federal judges for the next two years\nOr for the next two years after that so we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I can dent in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now is so important especially if you live in uh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years\nHaving no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nIf the Democratic party takes US Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president to anything done including criminal justice reformer reforming marijuana laws or whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house or do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington\nThat the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs seeing the ss drunk and you know and I know and\nSo if you're in one of those a contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is into destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so can I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American go Cunningham\nWill do my thanks to listen to you and I and fleas I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contests that house districts are one of these great Senate races please go

end the dreams della uh most of the fourth\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nLike on my news website over a ... that goes to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the top\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a strict texture to the pyramid and um ah the review are or who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper\nAh he calls his waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner bought every once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and\nI have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not\nCompleted there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul ... and\nThe papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to attend and he sees in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating the sticker layers\nUm\nDoes it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy\nIt's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you just you know simple minded Lee I thought each step they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their pyramids with uh something called they called they said that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically\nFor each amount that you go you go a certain amount Ford and that's how the conceptual artist German dangle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that uh the ... to ... I'm sure a shock to in fact we published that al ... was disappearing uh during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't al ... and the big tipper it was a star ... so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nBecause of that because that constellation it didn't it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper and we why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there this is coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coastal newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\n...

those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not ten\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example course number Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round facts of twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted tower but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of aid the image so I just kind of like you know painted that

tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of

five hundred BC yet which makes go ... happy not an accident\nNo within references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top

any\nIntention to reconstruct the original gory a key supply town and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties some\nRemote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples has this been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nConstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this was on the direction of Peter I'm a new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to ah descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know just the simple rules at\nThe surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create the sticker courses unless there is a purpose for so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with I saw you regarding\nTalked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous in as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become\nSelective so you know it probably depends on the project the certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's exhausted [noise] um you know so it's really in their hands and stuff you can do about it other than your just try it and what they do\nWell do you see that the the ... research would be I'm going like it is yeah ... yeah how ... was a job of director there\nI think he is actually involve a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or not maybe not publicly but it seems he's involved the opposite force by a ... foot [noise]\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed bag you know there is a public so your boss you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then I Believe there's a scientist archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of fun at all but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I used to be honest with you I understand it you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so [noise] um\nWell airplane you're being safe and political right now or not I understand that might do it and I respect that but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long if there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from Matt stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction are they gonna have to go for right now are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it's sort of ... the listener's question I think I forgot and Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think ... you said because they love it so I think that has something has changed a sort of a you know people are even your caller just talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nUh say they can research and I think it's been I think it's

speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think that I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nThat is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes\nThat the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... provoke pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak it was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined ad row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by a in a high I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than ...\nIn chamber will the ... scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nA lot of gun to bring a suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do what you mean by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who Don and buyer investigated it stop on the south it's on the\nNorth east side you know the north east corner right in the north east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers to me it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any effort excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the place\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host Jimmy church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my news said Sunday

here in Southern California and like I said my favorite thing to research my favorite is lost history and Egypt\nAnd our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramid\nA dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now minute before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly then what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that ah example of it but it was going on for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned as a last week on my other show fade to black\nWhich is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time\nAnd more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah I have ... as Graham Hancock a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive tour of some of these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with Charlton Heston of you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually the earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an Asia and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go to the wild card is going to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy Europe next on coast\n... how I'm okay with me and he can ... ... hope that get in that case they cannot\nFind suitable for all of our credit he had heart in the room like\nA ... a lot of 'em\nHe kind of ... ... ... in it that way it is harder hit than not in in mind and whew\nI'm located kissing me take it with the like I think when they can then maybe you could recreate part of the mom model if they would like that\nA portal opening hit hit these kids are you know found and maybe had something like ... they had in mind but he soon that getting ready to get it there you know it it while you have to think how\nAre you talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember ... built on the facts and said that they go get confused when his father her and you know she she arrived there at the end but and she had in mind ... nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits would get lost\nIn there and get it right now I Know there and eat it leaves and you can\nAnd maybe they ... you know they wanted the oil because they wouldn't go that route and had a rat and\nMaybe that's a great deal when their gender or oh you don't live in a concert there for a long time than male and getting out that\nMaybe\nDorothy Dorothy I'm going to jump in in in and say\nThat you are on the something my new and I have talked about this the the locks in their rooms inside of the great pyramid our acoustic lead tuned\nThey resonate and a while many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty\nWhich resonates through how the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nClare right and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago um I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory\nMakes has room for the you know extra space isn't a purely he may say yes\nI'm a so I could because it because of these residences engine oil electromagnetic energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or the other answer about ... you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know in sort of the same vein I I think\nSo first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a bit to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed\nAnd uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold um and ah him you know you ask about him you know so he you know or his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptian believed\nThat uh uh you know that ah just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members with the friends\nGreat call somebody let's go west of the Rockies to Garret up in Portland, Oregon Garrett welcome to go well\nHey the Matty great to have you on board um thing I have a question about the things yes\nAll right so about a year ago their videos pictures starting to surface\nNeal last rear of the things writing down at that ... well wouldn't really call them ... million on walks a yeah there's a there's an opening yes um\nI take it that within the past year the Egyptian authorities have removed about a half dozen walk and uh\nOh back by the hail walk by the tail end yeah yes\nYeah and what ... or the south side the ladder get over it and you have any comments like we're looking for hidden chambers but obviously we've already found them right there when we get to know what's inside\nNow he's talking about the south side of the rear of the things\nThis ... I see the south side yes um there is a ...\nOr so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces\nFlorida Republican Senator Marco Rubio says even if the Saudis denied any knowledge of harm against journalists Jamal 'cause she'll be a one hundred billion dollar arms dealers the significant bargaining chip to get through\nIt gives you leverage over them cause they need a replacement parts they need the training\nBut Rubio warned on CBS face the nation if it's found that the Saudis detained or even killed because she'll be\nThe Congress right now there is no pro Saudi element that's going to stick with our relationship with Saudi Arabia as it's currently structure\nA vote on Capitol Hill is being considered to stop the arms deal from happening in light of possible Saudi involvement colonel Scott ...\nAt least forty people are injured for our critical after a bus crash in California\nThis accident happened around one o'clock Minnie Driver on the south bound side were stuck in traffic for nearly three hours but was driving on the north side of the four or five when it flipped over the median and several cards and a total of forty four people were trading on the ...\nPassengers as well as ... and all those forty four people were treated all seen twenty five of them were taken to the hospital\n... ... is with Fox affiliate Katie TV independent Senator Bernie Sanders blasting White House economist Larry Kudlow on ABC's This week for saying that climate change report by the United nations is overestimated\nWe are in crisis mode and you are but admitted ... that virtually does not even recognize the reality of climate change and their policies working with the fossil fuel industry I'll make it a bad situation worse\nThe un reports that forty five percent decrease in emissions is needed by twenty thirty this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is talk went on for nine\n[noise] get ready it's open enrollment season for Medicare turning sixty five comes with at least one benefit you can enroll in Medicare open enrollment starts today and continues to December Senate if you're already enrolled in Medicare you can make changes to your coverage\nThere fifty eight Medicare Advantage plans available in twenty Nineteen and twenty six Medicare prescription plant you can find out more from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on line at C.
