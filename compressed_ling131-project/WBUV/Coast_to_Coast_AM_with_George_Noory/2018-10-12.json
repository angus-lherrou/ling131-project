estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back and then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the differences George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been this far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities and\nThings like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nThe orange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be in the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens we have a regional war more what's that going to do the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption or around the\nWorld and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book came out a year ago this trade war with China\nAnd ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise]\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're going to kind of bird them into equity\nIn our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank so this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some

E. R. dot com [noise]\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nDo thousand a year and a one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nAnd you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nInto rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nOf the reason why I wanted it as long as you're supposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them\nForced to spend it rather than being ... you\nDon't write if they don't spend it or you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but I'm taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is banned it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems which forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nYeah okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I guess and that's part of one of my question I asked\nA direct them I got one of my way to fly a plane up quite a few more weight on line\n... yup they play all about timing it all of that\nTime what am I going to have a moment that comic um okay what part of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are ensure they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting for those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank

to take a drug test and when it came back positive the nursing home pulled back the job offer nothing or a sued medical marijuana use is legal in Connecticut\nBut the nursing home is a federal contractor and Canada's is considered any legal drug under federal law\nThe judge ruled that the nursing home was wrong and denying nothing or the job saying they had violated the part of the state's medical marijuana law that bars discrimination against those who use it\nThis is believed to be the first ruling in a medical marijuana case such as this and legal experts say they expect it will be used as a precedent in future legal battles as more states moved toward accepting the use of medical marijuana\nWith Fox on justice penguin bloom Fox News\nFrom the men do viewing GMC studios [noise]

paranormal or a novelist experiences visions break cognitive dream\nA lot of body experiences encounters with message Barry now ... says well welcome to the program Dr many meters on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal hotter that'll happen for you was the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor is bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patients and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many Russians that that um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's quite a bit Dr ... moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that is right now I think he estimated\nThat something like one in thirty Americans has either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death affected me I see that I have some of this seems after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had the classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he and an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of that might just kind of brush them off you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nDidn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous themselves don't know it's called in how Jeanette transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOr this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOne of those super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so he was flown back into the don't you send in Washington DC\nAnd the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab I said that's it\nYeah it just it takes a lot to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bank\nAnd then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you were dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of\nThe psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post deaf contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm and in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you don't agree with you\nOK but\nWhen you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or cognitive beams and other things we've talked\nTouches visions hundred voices and so on death that vision is near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be fake it that was just thinking about it right\nOr is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nIn Mexico beach along Florida's panhandle residents are being faced with

little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned over this ... you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nIs dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these vision print disturbing at all they were very comforting\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people received messages in dreams which on cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these messages\nFor example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and how how would we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah that could be pretty remarkable mhm [noise] yeah\nI was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these words that said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was told she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that\nWas a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nMany people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they ... the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think fear I think people are they don't believe that\nThey don't believe that and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who have been blind since birth will have another body during during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up a book to tell the doctors nurses\nUm what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his doctor high and of course the doctor was founded\nThere was another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and ended up serving everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wild yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical their mysterious Israel different words of being used\nTo describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every parent normally then but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\n[noise] do you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't just have to live in nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your coals you your stories about pre cognitive dreams and so many of the things\nYou've heard us talk about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\n[noise]\nYou talk went overboard on his manager is known for their work with NASA\nWe're known for news and information used ... for nine W.

I was out of the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there's really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along the Suez Canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven\nSixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're awake\nWhen I was little they were when I've been sleeping all the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had\nIs what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I mean physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you are in that particular place of knowing what all income cussing love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or we've taken and I could see if you know what good are looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles\nWell this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with his glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow and\nI could hear the voice saying this is love and I was totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when they're just I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery\nAnd as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] but ... you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I've been\nAll right well that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed\nBecause they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether there's an illness that's interfering with their life so\nYou can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because\nSomeone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell there again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not as schizophrenia and they can also be ... nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy so you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of\nYou know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when he's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain in the dark and places that are dark maybe he's trying to help\nHomes are gone businesses are
