I think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally a pain the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you\nKnow this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the system's information in the in ... why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human and it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you know one of anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and union of their meal because usually they heal meal you and he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there is no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes

what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal\nIs to teach

surveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the ... e training at than than real Institute in Virginia and he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with these obese we might be wondering if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying nursing\nYou know for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a number of surveys\nAnd I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were happening were so similar didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise] a floating or um vibration high energy\nAnd sessions eighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet\nThere's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nUh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body because you're having it\nDoesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude in the phenomena associated these are common things that uh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a\nYou're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that I see the ... on because then happen if I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image\nYou're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience well\nThat if you wanted to ask the question like how did the here and they get here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried dead and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or ...\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd are we still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences\nWhere I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's\nAn avid believer and anything like that especially a religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience\nIf you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold of reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that as well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and\nYou have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived long lines where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of ...\nPatty experience where I was shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in the recycling took on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRide their owns a motorcycle and it was and it looked me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me\nAnd I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just because it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we are scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an added well out of body travel less likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there's consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn the what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function\nBecause it's not the same as it is here we're used to linear time writing the gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach in I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which has asked Trump info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his

Mike yesterday her website it's called ... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it says welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores we've been probably scaring the public's since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about pain because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the pay out of it it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really say pee on an erosion is is that this is Jay anyway kind of come to this [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true us\nSo will you send me your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during a guy at shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere\nBut what do what is your first experience with her normal well I\nAnd seeing go since I was the ... high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friends dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go bump in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do\nAnd interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book goes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to fire a cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nSwimming seeing it you you\n... I see it and I actually feel it\nI really like humans examples\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is gonna sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nAnd managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like\nOh this will be fun and kids get this we are oh\nYou're going to love the story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and\nBought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we passed the house in five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture\nIn the house ... what have you well after\nUs you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yes\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that\nWhile I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you pull out everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started to\nTalking about a ghost named sue\nHeart socialist takeover of health care [noise]\nWhich by the way it means your taxes are going to triple if you're lucky [noise]\nShe supports open bought\nFormer vice president Joe Biden campaign for Amy McGrath on friday afternoon pastor Andrew Brunson is back on us soil and met with the president before the Kentucky rally runs it I just spent two years in Turkish detention after a Turkish court convicted him breeding terrorists you had a long list of thank you to people who visited while he was in jail\nFor the\nPhotos of\nRam and author of very beginning so we are so grateful to so many people in Congress\nFor all\nPass runs it in his family lived in Turkey for more than Twenty years\nAnd then the sixty minutes interview that will air Sunday President Trump says there would be severe punishment for the Saudi Government if it turns out they murdered\nJournalist ... ... a former ambassador bill Richardson tells box the president should find out what happened to ...\nSo we got to get to the facts and this is where the president he's the one with the leverage over the Saudis we have this long term relationship and we're a long term allies\nTurkish officials are accusing Saudi officials are torturing killing in this memory to show and they say they have audio and video recordings to prove it\nThis is Fox News\n[noise]\nThis is talk went off or not [noise] sadness\nAnd the football world Green Bay Packers hall of famer Jim ... died at the age of eighty three\nTaylor was pulled back for most of the ... championship team do but I think sixty ...

desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I think that is the main thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live ... ...\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes the likes of the little girl that bounces a ball isn't she you I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere is no devious funds spirited no\nNo absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you\nAnd your tricks improve their it's here they are in\nPrison here by their own their own their own mind that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as the dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for gulls if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThe transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes the judge it makes sense when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only last about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you living in now haunted or did you ... non ... and the gas the ghost follow you right yes they\nDo on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just getting\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to err on its time because whenever I Would walk underneath ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said\n[laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights were flashing this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when you walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nTo you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happens to some people but the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh you\nHave you tried to say it's happening it well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of metrics I'm really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage the springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's\nReally at this point right there oh yeah you know the family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land and vulgar right there it seems to be a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light up light up with a red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountain\nThis very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine is right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the of the pikes peak they believe was the naval the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know\nWhy is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love that stuff hikes peak gets very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it\nAnd um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of

little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends and lower but this particular one like he has\nA lot it's considered one of the [noise]\nMore crucial places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters in mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well I'm a peak I think it was called T. T. V. a\nTiVo or have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why are we going to call that connected to the mother okay yeah it's connected\nTo the mother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThere and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold rush\nA produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how\nPerhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado there were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards above the pound it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hungry they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone\nExactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way the the the ... mhm theoretically\nThey exactly up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ...\nA fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not there weren't a lot of\nPeople out yet but a lot of people for this I mean just outrageously crazy and he found his story we're in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know when farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um we you know we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit or a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually has some big hair\n[laughter] and um then has\nReally committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick listen the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend he probably if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believes that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling intergalactic Lee and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing length maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell Jimmy ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and goes and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because\nThat's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature Bigfoot now Liz day [laughter] I wouldn't have gone Chinese would know\nThat there was a hundred and fifty four different names\nBy the Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they relocated a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand but I mean that's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating you'd open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense\nYou know if all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it it's like to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men issue springs area and garden of the gods in areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again\nAnd it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished the Murphy company came in and they

Institute in Virginia and willing cells as a\nCertified therapist and he guides you do these incredible states of consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me William\nOh how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such an eye out of body ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explored it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored um and it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and\nIt's quite a life change your ... your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience when else induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I\nI learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know to see him\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out
