I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then they think it's kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go what was the only people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been to which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write that ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck out for their beliefs all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year\nThey they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nHost or to pull a tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which will never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so do you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually actively around the only other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic\nTable and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad\nStuff to an actual historical artifacts that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over start start heading to the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around an alley\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ... hour\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad [laughter] you're not really that that\nBut they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's in the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar

[noise] this is talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\n\nEleven counts of murder I'm Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charged with opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in the ... and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the sentence right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses\nEmotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power\nOr of the press or there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding\nThe story of the men from the train [noise] uh but this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two\nWhere true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime\nLegend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these\nTrue crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying\nThe root cause sham that not run for your life [noise] uh all because of a story\nSeemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right\nIntent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well I'm not wading into a debate\nBut who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happen not everything is die hard to\nNot everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up\nPeople who you believed to be guilty of some thing stave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened\nIn the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all the clarity of graphic patterns and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland them extra cursed just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve blood the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and\nBreak through his hadn't had had been achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms but uh it was it was a very slow process and it has a very infant tile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\nWell yes\nWe were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven a Nineteen twelve\nWhich will runner and he was killing a lot of people\nBut the earlier crimes we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen ... eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow that I'm getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got into that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are ... I had told\nDaughter that ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years I mean the out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would cover is track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we would just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with the last last murders and the series\nSo are we just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a\nEvidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because\nIt's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you say you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he\nAnd he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh\nI think that he while he used an axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was heading the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something\nThat he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um and it was not what he was trying to do but it's way would do if you had to do\nA lot to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn\nAbout the human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves\nThat we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey they are part of everybody\nThat I've had the pleasure of knowing\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we covered them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way at the last book I read was the real crime it was the real world leader\nA it's a book by I'm Beth ... a rabid Weinstein I could have a lifetime or\nOr the or I think I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you\nKnow there surely it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories that just were picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and

were saying the crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about\nThe man crying I didn't make a river and thought oh entered into this subject I just got her like a I was a documentary about the murders and all those guys were called\nWell let's go living with a mystery it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above them mama levels of crime documentary I was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively obvious\nThat the ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour into\nInto trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution that would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her death and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the train you trying to bring in even the which a hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On an exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime engine and he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who ah was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nAlways believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to it yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that ban hadn't actually gotten away with it was this other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out\nI understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it unpunished I've I've I don't know if there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of that\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books or search for understanding\nAnd a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh\nI grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery ... ah what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people have our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to\nCreate a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they live and die terrible Beth\nAlso is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and ... there what is it that always sticks with me that I looked at the party or just banking and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he\nHad a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors in a town in community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a\nDelicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important than a crime story that is what kinds of stories are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten yeah\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nFor the

thousand feet at a series of crimes Ninety murders that happened\nAnd started to see the patterns and went back to the earliest one and we'll find out what he found out about the name of the men from

genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so\nSo it goes wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work do you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise]\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment kind of thing so I Wonder what\nThis this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young it was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nThat's exactly what you're so what is saying that that that's who he was that that's a that's how he knew himself I I don't doubt that Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person a he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and here that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself and his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally\nWhich makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because\nThere is an obvious lack of planning and I'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he is his the documentation of his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nThrough in about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point what year had he gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut uh it was not a nurse if there's a ... because\nIt was not um it it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ...\nGenerally as a charming right motives often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that it was it was a true psychopath a psychopath\nHave no fear a rabbit known norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing that's apparent about this the ... the ... and the training that from his crime\nIs it ... it was not even not acting and fear he was he was\nCalm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with so\nI just probably not that I should have made this other point first the\nStory of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about\nHim in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's miss they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nA this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research studies so we moved on in front of the book but very still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask you about the Boston Red Sox would you also does quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw industry question about the Boston sprinkler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at coast to coast am dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise] for thinking along those lines and foremost the latest news for than whether this is talk of oil for nine W.

through that area and Eighteen Ninety eight ah but ah it's cold it's cold a lot of the year and he he didn't\nHe didn't read all ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never happier limited to South Korea um\nThe uh that area is a interesting because it it's always been a hotbed of um\n[noise] a reformist motion or a movement or it's as you've no doubt no a a a a\nOne of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the uh uh is is uh that exact area of upstate New York but also many um religious movements from the nineteenth century actually I'm a native from that part of the country\nI don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the the ... the ... the murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and the ... they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was kind of book it's poetic they're

of this yard\nUm they had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTill he white you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly it is not Chicago\nTechnically but the um as Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that's the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a ... and I'm\nBlanking out on the name by which the yeah prizes\nSeries is known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that

really big or it the first crime everybody\nKnew everybody knew what he looked like it it was a very unusual looking man but for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of\nAnd then posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west and the same era the it was ... it was
