and there's nothing\nIn Washington that can stop it there's no immigration reform package by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop the flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function

what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that ah frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\nNo one will take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first base on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars okay that's what I'd like to see the first\nHuh what a birth certificate that would be\nYeah there you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that we're gonna have to grow\nOn you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars once they're done which might be\nA hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of Mars and change the environment because first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm up\nAnd we know how to warn planted some\nProven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively\nAnd uh the way to do it is to produce greenhouse gases um that is that tramp the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and see it on to\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet and cast says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use and refrigerators and air conditioners\nUm the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now in\nFifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much Clinton freshwater in most places there is a north\nOf Mel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to slow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make\nOxygen for Mars to breathe a ... but if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we could do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent to ... five percent\nAnd in in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified within two hundred years and my guess\nIt'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about and who's going to do with the country\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves you know when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program Germany they watch us some idea so then they bring us back\nA while we'll set a tragedy a few weeks ago with the ... or ... an astronaut or had there were born\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh years since the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people [noise] um I think India's gonna rise to challenge but now China and Russia I've got a ball facing a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess Chinese because they see the benefits of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress they moved away from command economy [noise]\nUm but Russia\nThe issue there is not allowing a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is basically organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the ... and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sex and they're going to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nOn Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll

... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now is about where the U.S was\nAround Nineteen sixty seven\nUh I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been to earth orbit me there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't want a small space station which we cannot have\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\nTo go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon I mean but the thing is fish okay once again um\nThere's a new paradigm\nWell and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't do and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries have gone to uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding but they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy west and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do though\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons\nOkay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well uh did presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then\nGee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nOr they would launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel if you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block me a a you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing\nPropulsion to orbit I'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert leery in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Rob a okay All right well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nAh nobody'd be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um\nFuturistic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and\nThe exchange for those claims people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids\nBlack

constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland is research at the University of ... ... email maps environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters\nBrand didn't has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to George I'm excited to\nBuy got shot at a political therapists get involved and go studies\nOh well actually I was interested in psychology before I was actually a clinical ah actually I actually got it\nStudy the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do the work is not very well [laughter]\nWell that's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight which was that was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just social studies born he was an overview of what you been doing random\n[noise] well um you know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going in and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with the go studies\nAnd you know I'm sure that listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes land counters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as hallucinations interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things OR Books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the ... the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters\nA book well then you bring to do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out\nThere you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded to brag about what the ... experience might be a real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think\nA majority of the ghostly encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the one of the\nThink there's I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's um inside is basically um\nTelepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's philosophy is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these viral energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this\nIs when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of\nMy aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distress signal thing ah to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nThere's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population so if you think about this\nHumans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nMultiple agencies who are here

work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in it than most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] they've all got one doping\nAnd I was really shocked you know 'cause you gotta sit back and got away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nYou know there's there's still some colleagues you'll come up to go you know I don't tell me a story but then they don't follow it up you can't do any water or anything but the response has been pretty positive\nUm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of\nTime you know does this go stuff [noise] um so ... you\nKnow it's not that bizarre or out of context them anything\nAnd listen I mean parents college he is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline\nJust like social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you ... you don't have the answers\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nPoultry guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like when the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bad the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre wasn't I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of telepathy or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional shift related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witnessed I'm the typical soft glowing light operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is\nSince his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died where did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all things electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as\nWell and the animals she does show you know\nAny involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go while they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone who's walking around in a way um so\nIt's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a Pulitzer guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic fields are always present as well since since the first go counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating maps can actually cause\nA ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghostly encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that a ghost is president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher or you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\n[laughter] um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with ghostly encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the room felt energized or like there was felt like a\nOf electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nJust go to Jason in St Louis Missouri to get things started hey Jay's\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that you're [noise] hide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in ... you\nKnow I I don't think so you you know and and and this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see ghosts that sort of I'm hanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um\nI I see the the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times and certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there is some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience with some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting it's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth balance spirit but I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us and way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them you know it's it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's some\nAbout Pakistan if they investigate than expected cutting pay and pay or the as evidence
