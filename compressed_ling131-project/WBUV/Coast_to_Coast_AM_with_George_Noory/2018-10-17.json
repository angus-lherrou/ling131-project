working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all\nThe yeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never\nHad the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with the new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA so called credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this\nThe thing you know search you mentioned astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four year last commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed routes for like write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably is is walking distance rod Serling first season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's\nThat's [laughter] ever [laughter] and they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right
