calls this hour questions and readings Jewish do you see or ... or on people oh yeah the ... did\nNot always sometimes yes if I'm stressed I probably will not see them the best way to learn to see or is it just looked beyond the person or in a dimly lit room you'll see something and then over a period of time it will increase but ours are very very important\nAnd understanding what they mean is the colors and the\nShape are all very very important in Georgia so ... you\nKnow I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yes he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any ... scared the heck he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable staff and the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the\nWord bat so absolutely George reminder as a psychic\nWhere do you get your ... power where you get it from\nI I don't think it's power I oh God that ... where it really is distracting yeah a lot of people say that and I think on the guy has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely free to call in I'm very happy to her and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from its life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to this show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question our connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want\nYou to worry about me and when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm OK Now and you know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's your question tried to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise]\nBut they do have a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a two wonderful dimension but\nUh I I don't want people to think the two sides that right you're supposed\nTo go and you're supposed to go and\nYou know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... birds\nYes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have them ... ...\n... is feeling the threat class sent you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive so if you're with the press and has not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche a\nVampire shy or but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates or the ... day in year and then I just didn't want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be grave however you run a judge that's\nThat's the one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris ... or the\nBorn on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy

you'd have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paint you should be painting again that's very therapeutic the press\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough now ... so I Know you can read people\nVery quickly so I thank you very much for calling it did you have a question no that wasn't but thank you very much\nTime okay Thanks Chris in Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo

most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to do like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy though and change your life and try prayer and meditation they know what I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and something no an spirit will work

the day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school back to dreaming his original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient shut Monica mystical practices\nYou're listening to the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the authors got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back Marc ...\nGood to be a dream and were waving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the opera singer and the psychic media and lived in the mean ...\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned when she saw him I said that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white face well she was right that went to in ... Maine yet when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in the house bill the dog all told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything not sure what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with I found that the ceiling looking at the the the does the scalpel in the so didn't not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old and re nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride looking to go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bed back eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk the adults that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this\nPerson who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nIs that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily\nAnd an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that were moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mine this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face becoming\nSit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self\nAnd help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious corrective treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other\nWill we traveled a parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird\nAs some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical deaf so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from the life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my including cleared the loving family members are ancestors a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get the on the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get into the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is another time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human kill human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for our souls and indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities local unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat him to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in that these examples proliferate so ...\nYou know what it how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping what his waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so dropped the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think there's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating minded matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things\nThat are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is\nGoing on the body reacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis\nIt's like gosh are my blood is bode again it's not at all when you lived in\nPants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland beat the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in that before it took place\nAnd the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment on just the patriots symptoms because but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was diluted you\nWell you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we know thing we know what the bleep we know that\nWe know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people\nWe feel what the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active dreams and the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose the dreaming you would call it shut medically dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do the dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance and adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror stuff the stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on the ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time than that risky twilight state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the\nPool to loosen dreaming and finally active dreaming that the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look at the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find the behind something that's scary you know\nLearning and you and your dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a Robert we are going to

some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's in situations joke in his dream life\nOh yes he was young young was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections that he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him and dream so here is a man I mean a titan\nOf scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream one of the stories in my new book mysterious realities involves humans passage into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of that is in the previous documentation is that human dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake ... legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling get up in the nearby village is living in another bowling on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost old fear of death you felt absolutely confident in certain he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious around his Kobe all the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually get some insight into where how you'll miss mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself to a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped his view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because in dreams as you understood we receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams we made travel\nInto the realms where they are at home just very briefly one more thing about him and his relevance to this book in my approach to everything he came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you\nContinue to live in other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dream navy memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... is it ... through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price\nOf surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew firsthand about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding with all the things we're talking about some immigrated matter of you\nWho wasn't young close who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had disputes\nFreud regarded as his ... his ... year old was your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own and writes who made himself his number one case study which\nIs what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of despite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on and dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to humans dreams\nAnd you only had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels and the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is a a floor vote ... goals and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know among the complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a cup of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena\nYou talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so scared and confused and and and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun us and he was going to happen again\nAnd there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing up hot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena synchronous city which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's a vote on a long way since he died but that doesn't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious reality the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nI imagine it around is a space between time I did too that the weather of palaces and schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from a high a level I borrowed the word for word from from the writings of\nSome medieval to feed mistakes who spent a lot of time traveling in these regions what what the
