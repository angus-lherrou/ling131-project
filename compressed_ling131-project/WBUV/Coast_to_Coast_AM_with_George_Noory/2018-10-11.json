several great books including the field and the intention experiment in her latest the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George is great can be bad you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results of a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down and it the it hit a tropical storm\nReally fast or something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at this from the University of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm runs thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purifying water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDoes that work and the trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so\nWe had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other\nAnd I also beamed this live\nOver my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide through self off of forty foot\nStructure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think it was going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work

group doesn't intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted to end was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all ... state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nervous scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be that would be an interesting for\n[laughter] well you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in the mail is ...\nUm we're going to do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know I'm a different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me with the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiment you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiment\nSo when we started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise]\nUm I felt like I was part of the higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own home\nIn front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy\nAnd the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment\nTheir line became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect\nAnd when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful [noise]\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nLynn we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take phone

Fox News\nFrom the men do us GMC studios he's he talks going on for nine points and I urge radio station\n\nMichael Dunn graded on jak Callahan Fox News it took twelve hours from landfall is the third most powerful hurricane every other\nYou know we were always meant to be in groups we were never and we were always part is supposed to be part of a greater whole we've never supposed to be alone and I think there's something about that group support\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health for your happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases with my master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers and they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is a batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person and that's the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know\nPraying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWill work for people\nOf certain age brackets assured sex or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things to intend for and how to do it but also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called um Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen\nBut he ended up going back to his fighting weight you've lost weight and he got back to his\nYou know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again\nUm he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life was getting better and even his training you know his his um his his trainer at the gym and said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when Mitchell would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good in tender I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it or ... or whatever you do yeah\nUm but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about in my book the field\nYou know we are in knitting energy all the time we're in meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so if we have this one little power thought saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it\nAnd so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about is being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe will fill in the gap\nAnd that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes fit land the gap in a really negative way you know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was\nA Paul McCartney he's a second wife um she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife\nAnd he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs\nBut she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs\nAnd that's when Paul McCartney met her now Heather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly after pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle\nBut I think you know what ended up happening is as the marriage got sour um she they the British press\nStarted digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this and so suddenly Heather from being very famous\nAnd kind of revered was innocent is and so I look at that case and I think they're a big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nHad consequence and they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they\nEverybody remains under a day in the shelter order
