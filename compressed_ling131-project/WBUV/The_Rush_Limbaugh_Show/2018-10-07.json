gonna have and will fund we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that send away

making their choices tape resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom\nLine is finish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter\nFinish do your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of the ... election doesn't mean anything\nPolls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody\nWhat she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is is it is not mocking Kristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy Russian because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump will necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony\nCompelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of caught their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it\nGives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do\nThe right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique\nIs a trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\n[noise] but I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished that after he makes that initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot\nTell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump has been attacked\nSo much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\n\nHe just simply probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why\nYou're not relevant why does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel and then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell Roche women women or nor do we do well\nYeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nSaid guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party is and so that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused tests\nWe didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that\nBut who is no longer in custody of that should be very

B. B. and I heard a radio station\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review\nReadings and welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books your ear is the IRS the James moved on to the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIs one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you can even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls\nAnd go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate that's sick\nIt ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen\nTo them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in on fairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhatever he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and\nShe said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had Woolsey forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show",
