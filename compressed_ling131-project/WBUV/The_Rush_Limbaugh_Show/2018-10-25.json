don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what

him being an American how basically on there that was to watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer to the solution is to spread
