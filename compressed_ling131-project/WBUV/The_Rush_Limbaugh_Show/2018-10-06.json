of five years in the last forty years\nA sixty five year old American female in twenty Eighteen is expected to live another Twenty one point six years the age eighty six years old an increase of three years in the last\nForty years\nInteresting haven't we seen taller estimates than that if you will yeah\nAnd this is is a little bit different look over a lifetime but when we go look in that a husband and wife when they both make it to sixty five cars you're looking at that group from sixty five oh no we're not looking at\nYou example or me over our lifetime expectancy but we just take that group once you've made it everybody's sixty five and up what is their life expectancy so you're just focusing on that group\nAnd that's getting them into the late eighties women to the early nineties\nSo let's see what was the difference there eighty four\nAnd eighty six so you know one thing you've seen as it is narrowing between males and females more so than it was but you can just see how life expectancies increasing so if you're retiring in your sixties\nLate fifties you know retirements another thirty\nThing about Thirty years 'cause your life expectancy is going to increase we kind of look at it every decade is going to increase\nBy one point six percent so even though you're going through retirement you're adding on years and with what they're doing in research\nAnd and and the genetic stuff and actually figuring out how to give ... instructions on what to do change the behavior fight this off\nWe could see life expectancy increase even more and I think that's one of the big game changers is the last decade how it has increased and finding that if you have a problem you know we we just didn't have these machines forty years ago to do all the scanning and maybe so but\nNot before double right and I I think it's reasonable even while my health and ... you know my insurance won't pay for what I'll buy you pay for it you want to live longer\nYou know I'm I think less and less people smoking which is something that will kill you will shorten your life it's it's a fact they don't just stick that thing on the side of the\nPackage say you know it it it kind of says so many words real ... like this this stuff's gonna kill you if you keep using it but people do that but it's less and less\nUh\nHad another thought along with that ah\nOh yeah if you if you once again you don't think cigarettes will take years off your why go buy some life insurance and give them to court you both ways non smoker and smoker smoker writes double\nIs it that much more yeah wow All right well not messing with that than\nJust putting that out there okay going back to require minimal distributions on the inherited IRA or just period yeah well inherited IRA we're still talking about that so you have some options when you inherit that account a generally\nThe default is the stretch meaning you can take it out over the rest of your life and it's something you have to make sure you're doing your ... who's responsible for one of the youth\nThat inherited the IRA is there some form you gotta fill out don't let them know what you're gonna do you're going to take it all out in a couple of years or sixty months are the stretcher\nDoris is aware of the money there of the accounts that are a\nCustodians furnished that information you know\nThat somebody's die that the money shifting to a beneficiary and the way the our race titled also makes who the deceased laws and who's the new owner of that block of money\nSo the preferred is the stretch however Seventy percent of the people\nTake all the money out the first three years that's why inherited money does not have that federal protection like your own RAs basically protected up\nTo a million dollars meaning somebody can you know a like a bank collapse don't take it away\n\nLike somebody can't sue you and take your IRA money oh that's different yeah ah so it's protected in that way it's not guaranteed for market loss or any side could eat bill mess all that up I like an FDIC sort of equivalent ... no it's just it's protected money that\nThey can't just take it from you it's protected in that way but\nA inherited IRA cannot be but you also have the five year old we had somebody we ... we came across came across us came in and had a discussion about their account\nNicholas working with them and it turns out that yeah they've had an inherited account for more than five years\nAnd if not taking anything out of it well that is under the five year rule that if you are not taking the our indies from the account you're going to need to take it all out by the end of the\nFifth year of death is really what that amounts to now they're beyond that so there's all kinds of penalties and stuff you know it's penalties fifty percent of ...\nOf what you didn't take out that you were supposed to so for we can't touch that account they have to talk to their tax people or go talk to Jude heath which is a member of our total wealth authority\nAnd kind of get this resolved you've you've got to go talk to the IRS 'cause one day they're going to come hot and\nFor their part of that money the taxes there\nAnd what's your other option you could just cash to say oh I inherited it OK send me a check you you could just say yeah\nYou know you're going to be taxed yeah I Know tax me with old yeah this this and this might have a pile of money to pay it with you know ... and that is some of the options there that you have so you could just cashed the account\nYou can do the five year rule meaning yeah I'm going to take it all out some time over the next five years or you can do the stretch and take out the required\nMinimum distribution over the remainder of your lifetime based on a table one single life expectancy table for beneficiaries [noise]\nGosh we're out okay well we'll take a break and we'll continue this discussion 'cause we've got some other information for you I have a question

I got the thing that they want to go on the line I don't want no electronic nothing like that I Want to talk I Want I\nI Do you not been into his office and how to sit down you've not been into my office somehow had a set down here here's my thinking a reverse mortgage can make the ballots go away\nBut I Would rather you hold off until you actually retire because when we're looking at your streams\nOf income you've got thirty five thousand that's not going to go a long ways that's only going to create small amount of income from that Social Security would be income stream too and then a reverse mortgage you know let's just say the houses paid off it's worth\nA hundred and fifty thousand I think reversible and once again ... you get more out of it the older you are so I I wouldn't really think about doing that reverse until it's at retirement time whether at sixty six or sixty eight\nOr Seventy because that's another source of income and really one of the your best benefit is real right here what's the best thing you can do work till eight Seventy cars you maximize that benefit you'll get more out of the reverse\nAs well and you're four one K. will be larger that's going to give you the best opportunity for success if you can go that far\nAnd and that's what I uh I I all the time and that's what I I Am a learned and I think I'm going the right track them because when I first talked to a blank I it it's not very smart and I told him I did that my I don't think I'm ready for it yet\nI might want to wait a little bit\nAnd that's when I thought about that we financing and so that when I started the ball rolling and I want I don't know I don't have enough money to go to ... I\nI I understand that that's why I gave you really great advice here and I don't know about this going ... create another thirty year mortgage or something like that now we need to get rid of the debt get your position for a reverse that turns on income\nAnd then you might inherit some money later we can't count on that but we know you've got three sources of income so keep working and keep building that up all your numbers are improving every year and keep listening and it you know if you want to have a phone conversation\nYou know with me at the daytime job look we'll set that up and have a conversation if you want to drill a little bit deeper illness in the future\nJen how cool is it that you and Twain have been together for what seven eight years now so Dwayne is starting to learn some of the nuances of how the financial planning overlaps with what he does\nAnd so like this might be I'm just throwing it out there this might be one of those where she clocks the reverse mortgage but doesn't spin the line of credit unless it grow because we know she's going to need it in a few years like I'm not saying we're going to do that say there's so many other options yeah ...

to talk to us give us a call ... four to six zero zero nine nine by the winning a life ... you can text or email and then we'll check back shortly so let's talk about those jobs numbers this\nThree point seven percent unemployment rate\nThat are that are that you got to go back more than forty nine years best number forty nine\nYear in Nineteen sixty nine last time we had an unemployment rate this low [noise] three point seven percent\nNow the the headlines here are a little misleading they talked about how a non farm payroll payrolls rose a hundred and thirty four thousand well below estimates of a hundred and eighty five thousand uh but\nWhat I Would like to point out is a under the surface the revisions for August in July were huge August initial jobs count was two hundred and one thousand in this report\nIt went up to two hundred and Seventy thousand july's numbers were originally reported and then revised to one forty seven well that got revised up to one sixty five so all we have there is another what Seventy and then another another twenty something thousand they're so almost another hundred thousand\nWorth of jobs which would on just about double the real number that came in so are these are these ... huge numbers as far as job creation goes\nUh the hourly earnings component finally has taken off like we were hoping it would have about a year ago but it's up to point eight percent year over year\nWith the increase in this last report or it's still a pretty broad improvement\nThe uh the unemployment rate among black Americans declined again not quite hitting its record a five point nine percent in may but it's at six percent so it's right there with it\nA Hispanic unemployment is at a all time low female unemployment ... at a historic low not all the time but it goes back about sixty five or so years\nSo the revisions is the big stories I don't think it's getting enough reported on foot\nI mean how how do you improve on three point seven percent that's a pretty good number to report on anyway\n[noise]\nHe likes out of all that yeah you wouldn't go back to the phones are I mean I got more to say but we have people waiting\nYeah we'll jump backed numbers I have some comments and some of what I heard what I feel about where we are well let's listen to\nPoint that they can you wait on just one more minute then 'cause I I Want to hear it while we got the ball rolling because we were talking before the show one of the things that I I've been leaning on more is looking at the other unemployment measures like to use six right where you include discouraged workers are people who haven't looked for a job in the last month or people who are part time who would like to be full time\nAnd that's at about depending on which measure you take you six point seven to fully the actual you six number seven point five\nBut like if you take out the part time stuff where people still have a job for about six point seven and that's really what the economy feels like it's as far as historically speaking Irish remember in the nineties or in the aughts when unemployment was it about six percent things are still pretty good you wouldn't consider it a a depression recession\nBut three point seven percent how I don't think the economy's burning up that good\nThat that's the real unemployment number that just doesn't feel right\nYeah the ... three is the fish will\nUnemployment rate the youth five ads on discouraged workers in all other marginally attached workers these people are still unemployed but not in the market for a variety of reasons and the youth six ads on those workers who are part time purely\nFor economic reasons well here's ... ... and you said the seven point five only use six but the thing is you know we're pretty much employed as a country now you have these variations different ways to look at it it's just going to be interesting to see\nGoing forward how jobs for coming available businesses are growing hiring I'm I'm just ... going to be some neat stuff to be involved in and view and see how things go and where can can these the\nYouth three you five you can all these get lower\nCan it or are we there\nYeah well it does get lower then I'll really be impressed but still is this is a good report yeah All right out now to the phones fifth thank you for hanging on this is Vicky in Gulfport your next step on winning it life with ... how can we help you ...\nUh yes thank you for taking my call a\nQuestion about are very low for us to have had one for nearly ... years and the problem is is that a ... no longer with the person who was a straight arrow I trust\nDoing doing good [noise]\n[noise] I've been in a fast amount\nOf money and [noise]\nIf I hear your those download rap and I just I'm all for it but I didn't know [noise] just like well\nYeah and I really am probably in my money 'cause I'm forty two but I just said ...\nOkay this is the four one K. for your current job\n\nYou're rough can yes I'm here okay it's a four one K. for your current job right okay no previous for one sitting out there so you you're kinda stuck on what the account value is and the four one ...\nI Know I'm really not I don't know enough about it even try to start doing that\nBut yeah so you have company stock inside of your four one K. right that's right that's right oh okay yeah I I've talked to people that will do that\nAnd I don't know what type of deal or if you're getting it\nAt any discount night I Know that\nYou know it does take time you you have to get to know that stock if you're going to sell some a bit and then by an old develops and that's assuming that it stays mostly sideways I would have to look at a chart but yeah it's something that you're gonna have to\nPut invest some time in study in ... standing with\nThat you know [noise] you know and it\nDoes change Fifteen twenty dollars every two three four sometimes you know and that's\nPretty good it is if you watch\nYeah and I I don't know what the overall trend is hopefully it's a stock that will you know is oil prices seemed to move up and they may continue but uh well prices could go down when the laws that\nAffects that company stock as well but it's it's you know from a four one\nK. standpoint you you're you're adding money every month you're you're saving money and that's probably the most important aspect and then you want to make sure your selections inside give you the opportunity to go up in value [noise]\nYou know and I've known some people that are trying to do that and it doesn't always work out for them so just be careful on that timing of that stock which is what\nYou're doing there I think he might save yourself a little grief if you if you don't watch it as closely don't don't worry about the day to day movement of of what's going on inside that account you got to take a longer view you know that's a half of the the last Tony Robbins book you made me read\nThe first half of it was basically you know if you're going to put your money away and you and you you already have a plan if you watch it every day you're just going to give yourself heartburn that you're playing a long game\nYou know that whether or not to stock goes up day to day a little bit that the plan is in Twenty years when you pull retirement trigger that it's going to be significantly higher than it is today and that's where you're going to get your returns\nAnd the rest of it you're just a making business for Pepto bismol in in some respects if you're wearing yourself with it too much\nThat is that crazy Gregory maybe maybe you shouldn't be that closely\nI Want I I said it differently and I just said be careful with the timing of that I'm looking at charts here and if you were looking into June July August it sideways but it's kind of all over the place\nThen you saw or early September you know where you're kind of look at the peak was probably back in July was around a hundred and twenty seven dollars a share than we saw a drop\nThe slowest around one fourteen and now it's back in one twenty five one twenty six range and it looks like it has some momentum that it could continue\nYou know up but if you're looking at ... what does that do overtime it goes up and down you know yeah back February man that stock took a real hit dropping over say about a week there from around one thirty to a lower around one oh wait\nYou know and that is what yeah that's a great time to to buy yeah and but you probably didn't see the following price coming you know\nFrom a four one K. standpoint it your long term investing and you know if you're trying to make sure like if this market goes to hell what what do I do what you should be aware of that in what's going in the economy and stuff but\nYou know when you got ... like that you might not can figure out when to sell but when you see a drop at those low points those are creating some buying opportunities to add yeah so I don't know that in for one case necessarily that I'm putting my money to work\nIn something of free markets I kind of like the contributions going to into a money market and then shifting to work when you're getting a good opportunity to make money on the body\nAnd that's market develops index develops the stock up such as that and push it to work but otherwise you're ... constantly adding money in and that's where we tell people thank you for the call rough skimmed yeah gotta move on to a couple of more callers\nI was gonna say he'll be okay English is all oil thing turns out to be a fad or ... and it meet your next step on winning it life with Gregory Rick's how can we help you ...

that now yeah what do you want to do is go ahead\nA point I mean it's already derogatory on a on a count so it will get better if you pay it off but it's always going to be on there\nAnd I make it the elation that they take this reporting off if I Am compliant and make the payment that degree\nHere this is the thing it's going to update and it's going to show their you also can go into your credit report and you you could\nChallenge that but you also can add comments and such in there but you know you're behind your light they're reporting it\nAccurate you're not going to look you owe the

for the call Terry New Orleans if you want to be next five oh four to six zero zero nine nine five I'm James Parker we are winning it life with Gregory rich [noise]\n\n[noise] from the men do Buick GMC studios he's talked for now I don't even\nPoint and I urge radio station\nWaiting the final vote I'm Pam who sounds Fox News in just a few hours the Senate is expected to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court just at Fox they can't read how far is live on Capitol Hill\nDeficit next year\nAnd spending you know part of that is the tax cuts there which has also helped spur the economy you and I were talking about it this\nMorning we're over Twenty one trillion in debt it's going to continue going up and this is not a good thing but one of the things I I asked you your thought because I've got work really drill down in the numbers but okay we've got\nA trillion dollar deficit spending and you know Social Security and\nSocial Security disability healthcare all these things that we have to spend money on is continuing to take up more and more\nOf the revenue that the treasury takes sad and then look for that we've ever interest rates going up and make more money that's coming in is going to have to go toward servicing the debt and I don't think we're getting there just would GDP gross\nAnd okay we've got a lot more people are working now or is are going to be enough tax revenue coming in to shrink that make that go away can we grow the economy enough to fix that itself and you don't think so I don't think so and\nYou think taxes are old sell male it's an opportunity to shift some money and and maybe create some tax diversity but I Am one reason you should consider how can you build in some\nTax free streams of income the time to do it is now because taxes are going to go up in the future because we've got to solve this deficit spending and I think government\nHas to be dial back but uh\nYou know Social Security obligations Medicare the health care obligations are non discretionary spending is what's killing us yeah yeah and there's going to have to be work done there because this is just gonna keep getting\nBigger and bigger it's almost every empire collapses from fiscal issues from spending more than they take and then they inflate their currency and then everything goes to put\nThat's how the soil went from the richest Latin American country Twenty years ago to the biggest basket case in Latin America now what happened to the Soviet Union is what happened to the Roman empire and Marion ... back\nAll right Mary thanks for

follow up you wanted to do that with the blended in the T S P and you know it it gets a pretty heady dealing with these different variants on what is sort of the government version of the four oh one

you can get a call an answer\nOn a thrift savings plans of ESP stand for new people sort of savings plan so is that is there anything we can add for a active duty servicemen over in Gulfport\nWe you know on that exceptions for pre fifty nine and a half I have to go back to my rules and such we know that the IRS did expand that to where [noise] distributions for\nLaw enforcement and federal a\nAgency such as that and I I just want to get more detail on that but that's one of the considerations when I Know that somebody going in the military when they put their Twenty years and typically people joining the military late teens early twenties or do in Twenty years then\nYou know gosh that that puts them at forty\nAnd ... and our our recent caller that puts him a little bit older however that's pre fifty nine and a half so if we're taking a plan and then we want to make sure that does that way that exception for income cause or look at well I've got the pension\nThat now are the ... and in some cases I can see where instead of doing the blended stay under the plan because a lot of people\nThat I've known in in the past and no in the military and yeah I'm prior military as well the U.S army and Mississippi Army National guard thank you overall for about\nSix years and and I started that why I was getting help with college tuition you know the I Would get reimbursed\nMoney for that so that worked out good for me as well but knowing that a lot of times they're putting in the time because at the end of Twenty years they're getting fifty percent for example of what their base pay was at\nPoint as retirement\nAnd that can start at that point were forty reservist I Believe it is it starts like a ... in their sixties will just say instead of trying to pinpoint an age where reservists\nCan put in Twenty years or so and build up a retirement that would start at a later time but they're on active duty as a whole sudden ... and just use that number let's just say fifty percent of your base pay now two thousand a month so you can retire military you're turning on a two thousand dollar\nA month check and they're probably picking up that money and going and doing something else so they've increased their income that way and it and if they\nAre able to stay in and do Thirty years you know it's even more pay for them\nBut ... you you've got to make the promotions that you know even even from enlisted you've got to make these promotions and move up and those ranks\nAnd such to keep going and it's just like officers just because somebody you know goes to kind of means such as as an officer or they're not guaranteed that they can do\nTwenty years you know they're not keeping everybody that signs up in all the way through that so if you've got to make promotions and you know there's a lot more to that but it's just not a given that you're getting twenty or Thirty years\nIn from an officer standpoint and for the enlisted beyond twenty is not a given as well to get\nTo thirty but it makes me think about okay if we're taking that blended how is that affecting me tax wise when can I turn that on and\nI doubt that well it's just you're subject to the individual is that going to be enough money to support you at that point they might say yeah I'm good Twenty years I'm done I get on the blended I'm getting both I'm good I'm done I'm retired",
