left that said it was a conservative um we've said the whole time let's wake for information might be a crazy guy\nAnd might be as it was amazing to just say I'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was the right wing or or it was a left where\nAnd then when it turns out to be one of those two they claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea and it wasn't that not a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that

with these things it does ... at the very least it is at least we can hopefully ... avoid any injury remember there's been literally nothing that's happened with the it's been a big media spectacle but you know ... much less of a media spectacle\nThat what happened when Trump and many others mad at us and others and the government received\nWhite powder in the mail last week or two weeks ago so you know obviously we know why it's a bigger a bigger deal now number one it\nWas a media members specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously uh the uh the the chance to kind of blame this broadly against the right is going to be something that the media is going to take advantage of it at all\nPossible but we don't know yet and we'll find

Brady\nA man in custody in Florida where many of the packages were processed the Justice Department plans a news conference later today Fox has Rachel Sutherland just live in Washington\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] I also\nSomething sent to me here said that he was um I'm from Avon tour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is are there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party [noise] uh yes he's got pictures of Trump and he's got a GOP stickers all over the of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if\nHe has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker in New Jersey senator and the former director of national\nIntelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients today all saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to they must still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this when everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation that law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad ... bomber because it creates first impressions it it created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set\nUp at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have the GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so that Dr buys are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the drive wise are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there\nIs this from the media light a headline\nTrump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I thought a left wing media narrative that had been created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about them in terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the nose and what is it\nAnd if there isn't any knows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a pool here today\nFrom strategic good strategic strategic\nIn the poll running to Santa has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul\nIt's a big deal\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does\nAffect what people think their perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I as a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nIs tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper what Trump's tweet while someone nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs are Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up in the news of anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans are Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um it'll make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating to try to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learn things that I can personally confirm\nBack in Washington She's expected to use the information gathered during or stops in Gulfport and elsewhere toward improving Affordable Care options for women across the nation\nA half a dozen telemarketing firms are being targeted for allegedly violating Mississippi's called la\nPublic service commissioner Brandon Presley is pursuing charges against the six firms they were accused of making more than three hundred and thirty calls to residents that are signed up on the states do not call registry each violation is punishable by five thousand dollar fine you're up to date on news talk one oh four nine\n\nFox News alerts and arrest made in the package bomb probe I'm used to Brady a man in custody in Florida where many of the packages were processed the Justice Department print the news conference later today boxes Rachel Sutherland just live in Washington\nBut he says I suspect in the case was known to law enforcement official telling Fox News he had been arrested before for terrorists ... threats a former New Yorker then described to be in his fifties most recently lived in Florida\nThe arrest comes after the FBI went through a nail sorting facility outside Miami where several of the packages pass through one of them was picked up this morning intended for democratic senator Cory Booker agents also reviewed surveillance footage from that facility which is the size of several football fields we thanks\nRachel there'd been a dozen packages now in all beginning with a device in a mailbox outside the state of billionaire George Soros and suburban New York on Monday the other targets had been mainly high profile Democrat officials are former officials including former President Obama and Clinton\nPresident Trump just about to begin a scheduled event at the White House earlier he tweeted about the midterms suggesting the pivot news coverage to the mail bombs slowed Republican momentum meantime is reportedly considering an executive order to try to block a migrant caravan from entering the U.

on this\nHuh so where are we going to start a system that we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them okay Jimmy and Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I'm going to say in advance\nI had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or flu wave I'm Sorry ...\nI think I think these folks know that there's no red but I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ... you know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right in these these nationalist right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the themes anything not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state loses that they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy ...

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger\nThat at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except the theory is crock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt in violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and\nAnd there's not there's never any condemnation of ... you never hear CNN can getting any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure to people's the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them if they did the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics\n\nBecause the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to the Trump\nHow a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me\nBut this van I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nAnd dress up a van that says notice made and if

Republican voters were\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote registered to vote whatsoever that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid germs and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump\nPacing just like when he made his original statements about Christine walls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nOf lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no\nAnd and the way the backup what she was alleging so some people think that he's um during the same thing here\nAre basically tampering expectations with the bombers\nSuppression state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd there's some people think that this is very\nVery artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome luck of the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nSweet and ah let's see there be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need it at the site the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBut it forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest\nAnd also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten minute in terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis there's certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago it seemed like eight years ago that Obama was\nPresident and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nAnd the two thousand ten in terms of the\n... the ...\nThe Republicans one sick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes a big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but that hurts point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the ... a bit of an upset\n[noise]\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yes your ego\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted from grade

first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for\nSome of the corrupt practices have been investigated informed\nUh we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover costs\nMoney to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could to help him network with power for developers businessmen and the lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a\nPolitico story today I actually saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out that Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political starting ... the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\n\nThere are other news stories that

um um no my friends are not holding back I'm waving\nTo hear what you said at the upcoming press conference elite media eagerly anticipating\nAnd its upcoming they're seated at the department of justice waiting for whoever's going to conduct is\nTo\nExplain how they found the guy who the guy is if they've found anybody else working with\nThe guys are their co conspirators ... says there's somebody that has been\nWorking on this guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating revenue him up\nI mean there's so much that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite all of that there is enough information gleaned simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here\nAnd do you think for example that the the deep state not ... the Democratic party [noise] see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous\nWhat has been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nThat person and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mueller\nJust briefly to recall\nWas a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was how many dropper or your advisors obviously fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails no I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big\nSo they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador to step in the opposite of you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails\nAt one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation will get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement\nTo our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wedding and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion that without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it\nI Believe those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "26"}
