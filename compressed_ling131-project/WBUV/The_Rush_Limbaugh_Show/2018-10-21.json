Christopher Serino Larry wearable among others to boost the market for pennies dot company called ... tell me no end working led been ordered by an arbitration panel to paying eight hundred forty five thousand dollars just to ...\nA jury found Mr Serbian or guilty\nCurrently serving a one year and one day prison sentence Mr wearable pleaded guilty he'll be sentenced later this year\nAccording to the NRA the financial industry regulatory authority the panel found that this less than dynamic duo had to make James Martin a lot of ... just said that his late wife five hundred Ninety five thousand dollars in compensatory damages two hundred and fifty thousand and punitive\nMight be a bit to collect those since we know is in prison and lost his job is home and he's currently working as an overdrive the takeaway here as always know who you're dealing with plenty of questions and make sure your broker is it the new year\nFor the financial safari news network said oh\nYou're trying to get any of the night yeah\nNumber two don't take advantage of I didn't move [laughter] I did have a a a cool over driver once and he would he turns out he was a prison guard full time at bummer were butter Isabel Island Railroad and he basically new Bernie Madoff sure he was a hero inside the prison because you know parties a financial guide all the guys got hit by a\nRemedy it never learn sometimes\nThey don't read the new ... road [laughter]\nSo I mean do you have to be careful about these pumping dumps to right oh yeah Mm let's talk about a couple of buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket of strategy folks as it's just a way\nIt's not an end all be all but it's a way for you to divide mentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket nets for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months\nThe next one we call we yell and read so it can be mixed it could be our enjoy it can be read all the way it is your is your financial gold bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this book it should be at least one year that's yellow part\nAnd could be two five ten or Twenty years that's a red part in a day and I said I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money and we used a one year time rising 'cause a lot of money goes tied to the market that's why they call it the red and go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's what we have the number one if you needed the money you don't want to take money out of your your red account your bucket to if the market is down because you're walking and your losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together make sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and this one that a lot of people that are listening to us now he said gosh we don't have a great book is we've got all her money or four one K. we've been told us our retirement yeah we don't have any safer options and there's not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket but there are ways of your fifty nine and older\nYou can roll out some of your money in four one K. and get it to your own personal ice cream bucket or if you left\nJob or two when you still have this war when case or if you have IRAs these could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket and any funds that you'll say specifically to provide income when you retire and then of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under the yeah the ten percent federal penalty if it's an Iraqi\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what what are the accounts we see a nice the green book at our traditional Ross step simple race for when the spoils reduce the SPs they all are vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save in all those accounts I just mentioned we saved there to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money\nAnd so you know with Murphy is always says Steve ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever like Charlie Brown got along well if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting the money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to be able to do you reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happens to retire ouch now you're gonna do forty percent less things probably sixty percent less things was worried and retirement and wanted to do\nYou're basically going to sit home and sit on the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day you know that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes yeah and so it's not as much as you can take so again that this is why we call it bucket ballots you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're into four one K. it's all when the risk bucket there is no say well the safe option gives you one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year or you're losing money safely\nI notice that the bank gets into the danger all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we haven't ... about three percent and you're only already one percent you're buying power striking revenue financial evaporation we can't have\nAnd the successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and beyond\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but plants will go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next again that's how the troop land is that the truth but if the plan and it has all three buckets to read the green to go with buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this call right now we'll put together you're very young customized\nPocketing strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper marketing strategy has these three items and these three out of the most important items at any financial or retirement plan growth\nMaking sure the potential growth ... years you have the money they're protection protecting your money from taxes protecting get as much as you can from Texas protecting from risk these commissions\nVery important protection just like a quarterback has an off it's aligned you did office of wind around your portfolio and an income for the rest of your life with no questions consistent persistent reliable income\nWhen you decide to take it for the rest of your life no questions asked and hopefully that you have a couple of other green buckets one two or three you'll have increasingly come away through retirement we can set that up or if you are with the next ten ... two hundred thousand there'll be no cost of obligation and you'll get that financial education and personalize bucket strategy that you dessert Steve do how to do that\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nThis limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show those include inflation Social Security healthcare emergencies so many things the stock market volatility risk taxation\nBut here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime retirement income planned or his right folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account now the number to call in and meet with Paul Roberts who is ... ... local trusted financial coach in the Biloxi area\nIs eight hundred eight nine one eight six eight\nZero when you call and you will receive a comprehensive retirement review that will show you

charges a long time Treasury Department official with passing along secret documents to a journalist according to prosecutors Natalie Edwards admitted that she leaked investigative reports some related to former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates and some about accused Russian spy Maria Butina\nLeaking of documents like these is against the law prosecutors say Edwards described yourself as a whistle blower trying to get the word out about wrongdoing\nMeantime a former FBI special agent was sentenced to four years for leaking classified defense information attorney

Fox News we part Saudi Arabia's version of what happened to Washington Post columnist Jim ... after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nThey didn't even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces\nSo she's one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem that Bush\nAren't they couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it to include South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because\nThey are very very wary of this the Indians themselves\nThe Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to the terminal any injured they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus has in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\n\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any\nNative American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kitten that wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present Hervey kept having to take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it but you talk about talk about a meltdown and its\nTrump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious\nA nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there hasn't been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking setup gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty\nEight elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor rock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped\nThe trend the people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean they're having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no re Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if it was a [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey\nSoaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team\nThis is the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is

twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in her Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself Egypt ever doubt they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be barking on what a stadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully drawing crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if Trump didn't do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot

create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out\nCommon sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party

in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these pets\nBirds in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of

never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about\nThat and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the white like Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the sick\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen only on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most this thick of all human beings I've ever seen portrayed who is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad\nGuy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his

bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job\nHe one episode went to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship it's not clear to me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and
