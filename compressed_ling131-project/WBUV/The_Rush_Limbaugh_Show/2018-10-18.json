don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make\nIt's happened there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the Taliban is the children as it always is there are children in the

I say more on that in a moment the mother report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator but who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving\nIn the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating as Trump not letting them in\nEither there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion and it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adults so that the\nDrive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are\nAlready ... that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can\nWhere these people will say they're shocked that\nCame to America to save their lives were their children and to improve their latest they won't let the man is is unlike anything they ever heard about\nThe costs of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied in three Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this it'd be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is because you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... if that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is what we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if monitors ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the justices Lee finely soundbite here [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this [noise] yeah it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room he's\nA counterterrorism center specials what he is and bless your said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will from other going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative or for\nK. so this\nIs where this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff\nTrump is none none of which\nIs probably going to be in ... none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway um but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt ... not the in\nWhich\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up [noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed\nTrump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russians haven't worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea\nOf going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence that's what it's\nGoing to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times\nOn this program she has written a book chronicling they deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working\nWith Mahler and our headline she published this up yesterday at the Daily Caller Muller is Jay ... is up but that's not enough meaning Trump's they'll\nAll the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe boiler witch hunt is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an

going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something a little cam I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist mobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump's yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well Bette camp the camp that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that's right\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's why\nYard signs without being put I I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard\nSigns are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nI have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it took ...\nStill shot that would have papa pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose and there was this guy\nGet mon make looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then they're ripping it to shreds and at one point he stormed the Cruz supporter who was video showing him on his camera and got this demonic for\n... look on his face starts shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken still shut up put it up there this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping up out of yards and this still shot he is storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera\nHe actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't still shocked that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then threatening\nCruise supporters who have videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow slacks you don't see that in the steel shop here [noise] but this is happening\nReaders to know this left turn is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub had like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties and the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past Eighteen years millions of Mr Thomas Bee and so the Democrat electorate has most steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates self identified the liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party\nRaising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite have spread to the rank and come on\nCome on up the Democrat\nParty elite sad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken\nBy the left wing radicals\nAnd that's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next Grapel is is the money\nGraph ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this site simply leftward according to Gallup the Cheryl White Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage or a Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrat wait a minute in two\nThousand eleven all white working class was told I go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record\nHigh for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage a Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they have been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor\nHolding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story about the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are back back in the mountains [laughter] shrimp boats were sheltered [laughter] you know I'd be met for\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the

like\nSo health President Trump's visit time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy bill football and enforce the law at\nRepublican district dangerous Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern when you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it\nAnd in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just ... just the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you\n[noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalist not was not an executive but he practically ran the place [noise]\nI met him at Mr ... home he and ... you were good buds but Lance tomorrow was a a\nTypical turtles which means means weapons so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nEnded up the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes Liz mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been er ripper bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attached fuel Republican maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman thinking that\nI Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican ... I just don't I don't think the media's merges lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes here\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to Louis maybe hold elections\nBut but not Trump I just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults\nJust so totally\nPermissible in American politics and they assume this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be yet and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the this is the caravan it's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador are saying that they have almost no control over their population I'm watching the Democratic\nParty land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for\nThis somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nBut I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey so who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop [noise] so\nWhat's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be\nThat there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's got to be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start invite Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump the Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nBut afternoon rush hey\nI'm as for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do that in just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call you a call you finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up with South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them if they're not immunized and\nIf you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's disabling and also killing ...
