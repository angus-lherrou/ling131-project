southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being done do upset Trump's base that the implication is that you people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are just voted for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump [noise] but back we'll get to the more details that I ... back to my little test so I run into these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five ...\nLikens have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of\nThem are committee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows\nI mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to stay at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my ... great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook great in the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift in ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movements and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference born consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for a radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in in the past\nQuestion comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it\nIs a problem [noise]\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and other events this is his personal\nThinking and again these these events these falls surprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usually the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these false surprises and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house\nAll of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating or building a blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity X she ended the much heralded\nBlue wave you by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue\nWave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible\nThey're gonna they're going to win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than Democrats turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\n\nI think inclusion isn't there has been no blue way\nNational Weather service expects a line of storms to push through late tomorrow night after midnight in some areas\nClay Thompson is one of the stars for the Golden State warriors and even though he's been in a shooting slump ... we never got discouraged\nEventually\nAnd last night in Chicago that's exactly what happened tops and got his touch back making fourteen consecutive three point shots and that sets a new NBA record he finished

to this country but\nPrimarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a

reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're

I I have at times I've marveled that this country is held together by the way it has for as many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nYou watch your results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that it doesn't matter when they refused to accept it means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country and we may not unify issue ...\nIssue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you'd go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened\nIf not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out I think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this was causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirtieth unlimited abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restricted the blacks\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this\nAnd that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors of foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten joking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration and you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nUm people being rapid citizenship but we\nSuspended mass emigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright that didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there's no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're ... our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yesterday about ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that now Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate a look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which\nHas to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nAnd it was on my door or Guatemala um maybe long term\nA economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism\nBut there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate\nProblem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... and we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a bright zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere

behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the

when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because\nThere was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nShe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized from what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists from there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to ask the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mum preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable\nTo dispatch Trump and it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street is always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight\nWas that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I\nAm ... and I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dad or criticize made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected when you think what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how to think or tell you when they go start blowing things up or when you start shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYours the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now\nYou're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nQuick phone call before we got an architect cannot Connecticut's Patty you're next time I would welcome to the program\nBolger was convicted in

have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent caller\nI lost her when she was how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point that's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to bake a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was outraged and they began to\nReport on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude

are odd weird racists bigots sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred\nElectoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are
