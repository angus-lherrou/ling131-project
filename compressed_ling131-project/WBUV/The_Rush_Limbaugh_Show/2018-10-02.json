Senate Republicans me for a judge Kavanaugh's nomination this week majority leader Mitch McConnell calling and colleagues to reject the politics of personal destruction\n[laughter] no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what does that tell you what what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate and the house and if that not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate\nUnless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battles advantage for Democrats the you noticed that tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm going to get a little aside this observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave bitten yeah and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them the Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time he gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race you have videotape of a horse race that\nNobody had seen it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and that'll ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds have the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of a November election doesn't mean anything\nPolls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media\nWhich is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant could have been\nAnswered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the common to play out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate but wave\nRed wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\n\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after election day or maybe later that night\nNow one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that\nProduction of mine went viral and Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P in their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nIt's just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way you can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nYou're floating winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news is about to receive some of this from the hill dot com ran state Democrats face nightmare scenario on cabinet\n\nThis article shows beyond a doubt the Democrats are brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce cabinet you realize the latest\nDefense the New York times has run the story saying that Brett Kavanaugh through ice on a ... bar patron back in his days if you ate\nHe

that no news there but Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly on a ... page would stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualify\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope ultimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have\nJust just like the mother investigation murder investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers so the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support\nIn Washington by Republicans if they can get his approval numbers now that the money's because they succeeded make everybody think of Trump treated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there is no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the Mueller investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with it\nWhat they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from\nThe nomination withdraw or to force Trump to withdraw\nSays a lot of our city you know in the center of it anyways but especially politically Trump\nCan expect a friendly crowd in an area that's heavily Republican and he'll be joined at the rally by senator Cindy Hyde Smith who has Trump's endorsement in the special election to serve the remainder of
