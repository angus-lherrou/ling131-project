point and there isn't I don't see you know all of this in all of this crazy deranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist\nI haven't heard one elected Democrat did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or in the party from it\nI haven't heard one be elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back I haven't heard one\nThey're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this instability\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in a battle of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of

terms of the actual\nLandfall it's going to be anywhere from ah Mexico beach up to Panama City moving North West along the coastline Mexico's Mexico beach I think it's well it is all the way up to Panama City in Panama City beach\nBut this I wall according to all of\nThat and I've got some fascinating satellite photography here from the guards sixty and satellite it's interesting the way they do this you know how they take the um the radar and they attach different colors to it now what I'm looking at is\nSheer solid black surrounding me eye wall and most of the black is on the south and the west side and then it gets a little lighter there's some great then ... then\nThen white ... and then he yellow and then can and then orange and green and blue on the edges\nOut these colors do not represent rain intensity they represent cloud tops they represent the temperatures at the cloud tops which determines condensation and can determine the intensity of rainfall but most people watching this have\nNo idea they think oh my God look at that may look like it must be raining a hundred miles\nHour a look at that's black black writer run it'll kind of dark right it's\nDesigned to ski area is designed to get your attention it's cloud top temperatures but my point is it solve all around the world the looks like the most intense\nArea of this is due west of the Iowa poll which is where the population centers are based on where the eye wall looks like it's going to hit now but even on the east side eastern northeast squadrons are wearing the strongest winds are\nAnd those are going to be blowing offshore toward offshore once they hit land on the north eastern side of the Iowa but it's a solid eye wall and it's a large I wall\nSo it's it's it's a very very intense storm

there's no way to measure that that's wishful thinking but the reason I bring this up and I don't know Taylor Swift from a pile of coal\nI don't know that you could put a bag of nowhere in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in ... now\nThe story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in ratings well how the hell can it be if she is generating massive record voter registration and they're the hosts the television show an all time low record ratings\nDon't listen I don't have one brother but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of nor I'm saying\nThat's how it significant\nBut I'm just a drive by trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this was in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team started Lee says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who\nWho are using this guy worked for the lord and benefit a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the whole dot com Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what are the Democrats were smoking I thought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama one of the most popular respected in public figures in America should spend a day typing personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate this column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\n\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms are the most popular in respect to Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid terms with the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done although\nShe's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or versus my\nSo now there's a twenty five percent chance that\nDemocrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not\nQuite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum\nAction and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\n\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also\nPossible Democrats gain only twenty seats falling short\nOf winning control that would leave the Republican dominance\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than a GOP majority that day\nBooed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and\nTriumphant Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love\nYou see hatred UC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies use some house the division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling is achieve an unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert writes Butowsky warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ...\nUp the turnout ... up interest and they're really ... and ticked off at a bunch of polling data there is an NPR\nPoll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say\nSo this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential\nRace anywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances in three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press that Trump headquarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion I have with the

I forgot white women we don't like white women right that's right we don't even though I Am one white women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being this was not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\n\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a true\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circled there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of a Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm On four of\nCNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\n\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe s not by you in fact ...\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on on on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is\nThat Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statements every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against\nAll this instability for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side\nWith what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the cabinet effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\n\nAt least of the worst kind of hurricane hitting the worst off geographic area it's hard to storm surge that is taller than a car taller than a person and in some cases taller than a one story home\nMichael's I is now dangerously close to the panhandle coast in his uncharacteristically wide which means those intense eye wall wins will affect the larger area than what we usually see the hurricane center now says the highest just off that coast between Panama City and St Vincent island\nPower outages are already estimated to affect a million households Lisa\nBanks ... business networks Jeff ... in Panama City getting hurricane force winds for a few hours\nNow got our camera by day pill or the building that is why they're here as early fall [laughter]\nI'll tell you what we probably don't want to take a whole lot more chances of extraordinary experience president\nTrump just getting an Oval Office briefing on Michael from the homeland security and seen that she is concerned in part about anyone who didn't evacuate\nWe've said buses with a lot of different ways of doing a lot of different things to try and remove people from there but a lot of people are very poor in certain of those areas and it's very tough for them to leave\nFrom Florida hurricane Michael is expected to head north east bringing strong winds heavy rain to parts of the Carolinas that haven't recovered yet from the last\nOne or Carolina is bearing down another powerful hurricane less than a month after Hurricane Florence battered our state governor Roy Cooper on Wall street a plunge the dams down for three\nThis is Hi\nThis is talk went on for nine [noise] Senate Democrats\nMake a stand on a health care issue hoping it'll help with midterm campaigning Fox's Jared Halpern is lying on Capitol Hill\nYou Democrats lost the boat to undo a Trump Administration health insurance policy but Senate health committee taught Democrat Patty Murray says the issue isn't going away\nGoing to keep fighting for cancer patients and their five or ten people living with diabetes arthritis and other chronic diseases\nA resolution would've overturn the Trump Administration rule that expands short term insurance plans less expensive options that do not need healthcare law requirements Democrats say it's junk insurance Republican leader Mitch McConnell says it's about choice\nIt doesn't take away the choices they have under Obamacare but empowers Americans to use this alternative choice if they prefer\nA resolution was defeated on a near party line vote ...\nThinks Jared meantime the debate over the Democrats Medicare for all plan heats up President Trump warning in an op ed piece that some seniors could lose coverage Democrats refusing that\nAnd accusing the president of lying\nBreaking news on that limousine crash that killed at twenty people in upstate New York last weekend the operator of the company involved is now in custody not immediately clear whether the charges against him at this point are directly connected to the deadly wreck\nBut state police in New York say Norman Hussein again the operator of that limousine company has been taken into custody after a traffic stop on a highway near Albany\nAnd the crash itself remains under investigation recapping the sell off on Wall street it's fueled by rising interest rates the gal just dipping below twenty six K it's down four hundred thirty three\nPoints I mean the Brady and this is talk scene [noise]\nThis is from Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly man I Want to solve one oh four nine

smart but he doesn't come up with himself but so I Know I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance I mean he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I've very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you get the podcast everyday

I mean not just from\nPossible you have been raised nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia's just proves what a ... Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump ... seem to have any real interesting she doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not convey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia or not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quota came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward stability or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre set the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle exhort eater trending toward civility or barbarism\nIn off the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it [noise]\nUh it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nDry ... with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violence shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more to them\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic um issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou were what purpose\nMy part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much\nI point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone in Ogden militants and violet socialism to achieve their means my boys they're not\nThat different there just mess getting less today\nIf you know read about it in the paper tomorrow ...

that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss that these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time\nThese are people that are upbeat and happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them they want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary ...\nThe ... protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are slowing at the front door of the Supreme Court\nSaturday afternoon

inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies\nOr the exact opposite and I don't mean the people at\nTrump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people in there and they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy people in the Democrats sponsors\nOf an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way and it found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current\nAbout Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well [noise]\n[noise]\nOh I see no [noise] you know he just said no we didn't [noise]\n\nAnd I think that don't get about five and can you blame\nWorst body language on\nWords did she get a hundred percent you know hand your mattress join our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\n\nYou don't hand matches through an arsonist you don't give power to an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in a wicked PTO and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in dignity and up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it thrown right back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand sixty\nTo two years ago two years exactly October tenth eleventh wherever montage fear of people from ABC CNN PMS NBC PBS ABC\nNBC talking about the election October tenth two thousand sixteen the election was over Hillary in a landslide Trump had\nNo chance nobody has ever come back from this far down

election already this is ...\nDonald Trump the election ended today\nThe selections already lost the civil war in the Republican Party a lot of view of the lawmakers abandoning their nominee\nThe worst may be yet to come with Trump they may be staring at a total collapse of the party by election day the cumulative effect has finally caught up to us Hillary when that was big\nYou want to hear the names of their their names are Matthew Dowd he used to be a Bush adviser who's not just gone\nI don't know where you can't total left totally be see total offer reservation\n... who's ...

has lost the election or rummy sexual harassment Charlie Rose this isn't on winnable election but Donald Trump\nJonathan Karl there's elections are revving laws Lester Holt of NBC the civil war in the Republican Party a flood of GOP lawmakers abandoning their nominee F Chuck Todd of NBC the worst maybe you have to come with Trump\nThey may be staring at a total collapse of the party do we just saw that headline yesterday\nAt the hill dot com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democratic side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy that has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America voted for this guy so they're going to do and the only thing they can do and vote Democrat\nThey were wrong in two thousand sixteen some of them as we\nMentioned earlier this ah this ... budget boot cascade warning that there's a red alert out they're Democrats in may not be looking\nAt a red wave [noise] ah here's the picture\nLet's switch to what I got it in the switch rebuttal came now this is if you're watching on the digital camera and I'll I'll get this up to cook us and we'd have the website as well that is a satellite photo from goes sixteen I Believe the weather satellites\nOf hurricane Michael and\nYou can see that it is in terms of its total area it's not a large storm\nIt's intense as it can be it's a category five but if it does not\nThere was a as a meteorologist sent me a note a moment ago Nineteen eighties hurricane named Alan\nThe cupboard two thirds of the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd again the sensitivity here is is due to the fact of media is hyping this and even the weather service is hyping it\nBecause there's a course a political agenda attached to climate change and all that so\nI just wanted to share with you a sat photo that was sent to me to show that it's a tense storm but it's not even by historical standards among the\nThe largest every member real intensity these storms is at the eye and then it begins to dissipate but a cat five it's going to take quite a while for dissertation to become no damage just heavy rain and wind brief time out we will continue after\nAnd Lisa Michael officially made landfall near Mexico Beach Florida in Bay county down the shore from Panama City intend to air force base\nAnd as predicted Michael got a little stronger as its soaked up the warm Gulf moisture near the seashore the winds are

shoreline to\nEven beyond that down towards the Tampa Bay reminder that landfall does not indicator storm has passed only that it's center has reached a land mass there is a second half of the storm

the heavy rainfall act Kindle dozens of fighter jets were moved out before the storm President Trump has been monitoring\nAnd most of the entire size [noise] would you look at it it's almost the size of the Gulf and they have to see that [noise] maybe they haven't seen that at all [noise] nobody seen that before\nHe got an Oval Office briefing earlier from the FEMA and homeland security chiefs and
