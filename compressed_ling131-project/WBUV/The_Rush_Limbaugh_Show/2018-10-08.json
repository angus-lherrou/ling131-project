harassing\nRepublicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset is tied to them ... let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of their range loaded tests like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly\nThe ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the mid [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea well\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh four of them in during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not gonna fade away and I think everybody needs to notice on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been ... loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen then this Kavanaugh situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating cabin offered her pulse he wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a\nFull fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ... house\nJudiciary Committee ranking\nMember of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin on they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the\nCourt\nThey're not they're not going to let this some side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what\nYou and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I think it's only been tried like ... but we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether to pay it or not ... that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm democratic voters is less than what\nWe think it is just because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would\nSit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't going to win at all and so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it rather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current make up which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large electing Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about\nThem\nAnd when these are mad insane the gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet they could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably\nCloser to the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that\nDon't get it amazes me but it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party have large here's Jake

Democratic party doesn't seem to least\nBit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is\nWhat's going to further inspire more discordant madness\nWhich will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with

no power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed and then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question with every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of

he could have done it because he has\nMale genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and

you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get on the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told

the other and doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue\nCollar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely the that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be it ought to be that people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this bunch of ... for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats think they're going to turn out here that dwarfed anything the Republicans have to show up on election the Democrats think the whole country is because if they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied

with the with the Capitol hearing which so\nSinister and ironic and all this is if you remember back to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days of my mouth but there are\nAll the accusations with him or the media Saturday Night live a every talk show on the news outlets they these were the father of the Newtown other where\nThere are there stories or discredit them they questioned the motives on what Dr for where are you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have\nVictims of remember in particular leader for all the time the place to who what where when with with um and the army is so disgusting and there was no political ...\nWith with Bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect weapon use ah\nI used to call it a weapon for the perfect reality slap used to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see him or I'm a turban and number of them would even take a call from abroad for a member of their own party\nYeah but it's a sitting they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy but the fact of the matter is and I will say and again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault as evidenced by\nYour recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying\nIt was called a bimbo rupture in
