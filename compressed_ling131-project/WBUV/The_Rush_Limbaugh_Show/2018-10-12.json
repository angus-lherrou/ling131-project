[noise] [noise] [noise] I'll talk to you later perfect [noise] flown\nTo the program a glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air\nIs fascinating it really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principal hum and uh I I don't think I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump someone from South problem now he's a reflection of\nOf us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at how Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will\nIt really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a story in the New York times today isn't the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take 'em behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there and the new democratic what's the difference between\nThat and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back\nTwice as hard well I mean I I you know that\nThey did what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama\nWho who was the only one that I saw at all of the Democrats who came out\nAnd said holder comments were bat that's her phrase that was being criticized rain but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service\nThe Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nosed as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried to hide it\nThis which is now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the ... that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung\nBack and it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X things might have\nBeen worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want they\nDon't want to think of themselves as you know as you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either\nThey're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues\nOr they don't exist right like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person they just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know\nA beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right ... and everyone would say that that is horrific but you know the mother was over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and was going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it uh and you know who are on the left\nStanding up against

the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims\nDeserve to what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think\nThese clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate\nChange man made climate change as a whole are somehow responsible for people having lost everything and clothing risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota verbal and fluids scientists\nProfessor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching at ease engineering school the guy is still reigns this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans\nAnd his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michaels in tends to be on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others op so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he's literally there's one that's what he said\nAnd an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I I I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible\nIt would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAt what Kanye West Dennis simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there weren't people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana he wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew\nThat residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as Democrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so whatever people out there saying that Bush\nActually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing when he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking to me one of the tanks on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane remember that that Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming\nThat simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck\nRiviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida vote both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we looked at these events are these people do as one off political events [noise] some of these people who have been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with\nI mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives or it is it's heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change the impact on the people who lived there ... there were some who didn't evacuate and I made up\nTheir minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like\nEvery hurricane has those people who are hell bent they even want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how rock is the Starman storms aren't they want to see it\nAnd they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you [noise] it takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop at Limbaugh on trumpet stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong\nBut the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out\nAnd these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how stupidity how author leap politically partisan by the way

about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars and again people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a

done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie and it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate

producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this and I don't know anything about directing movies\nBut I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story\nItself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's viable tissue mass or
