problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self

Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day\nHow many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular order hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a two for\nThat was get rid of cabinet as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem\nThat's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael I have a nominee who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that\nWas effort investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star or did they turn camera hog into and where is he now and where\nIs the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students in had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the un alright where\nIs that the day what that meant\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is\nBased on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real when do you mean Russia's sitting on a long long he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David ... did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal ... these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience ... point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton was affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he\nDid anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she was a consenting adults jihad mile ...\nShe was a consenting adults I knew what was it\nNot abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nWell bye-bye me too movement\nI mean if the ... random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up now to defend her\nGuy what good is the meat to move\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without the media fanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that is my\nStill just as bad one and over three hundred two million labor reports that immigrants and massive caravan heading toward the U.S are turning back

[noise]\n[noise] that's right that's right the course of course I said hey we're back\nOpen line friday Rush Limbaugh to Springfield, Illinois Todd ... thank\nYou sir Hi Rochelle are you today for a good really good work do\nYou remember one needs to fix cell phones up front because they cost so much do you\nAh when I used to take cell phones or ... what do you mean\nYou would put them at the top of the line because it costs so much for\nAll we that's right because we so we the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cellphone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back ... back you go\nI I've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats the one on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income campus caved on\nAnd I think that they've done this at this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't judge don't call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but when they tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds wanna leave or one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are you a little concerned that Trump has not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNo I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a very it could be that if he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA maybe but but I [noise]\nStupid your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding lives own with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has a bit of a wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I\nI don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOver I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else did they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right and right there that's\nFor and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors like Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he is a a that he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think first it's\nCertainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him 'cause they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare\nRepeal and replace it didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side\nWell we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon\nAnd Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call and they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk so I got one report from a peanut the caravan has turned

Trump\nJust show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump is aligned with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one issue\nThat the media and Democrats you would have to say had some success and that was the allegation that the Trump Administration was separating\nChildren from their parents at the border\nThat wouldn't have some way that would work and that might be what this caravan as about as a as well\nUh even though it was totally manufactured and made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to I don't mean stupidity\nIgnorance of a lot of people

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs\nOkay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phones be patient were coming through you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that aren't going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew them\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which was the gang naive I don't have surveyed day that I don't trust the it hasn't been rife\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump gone I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively like this process if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the center because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame Republicans strategic ... about my combat\nThan does deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house for very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his or her scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those in the open seats has another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play has only about two or three Democrats to replace Tony on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them to see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff and to me this is totally abs and um\nThe Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that as a result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixteen I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen houses gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone [noise]\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting insanity\nAnd the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well\nThat would have to be what it is does the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing is landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even\nTrying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a\nCouple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned Matt and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued to try and portray America\nAs this unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed\nAgain I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim\nA wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nCome off no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh but Saturday\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomena the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve ... who has a weekend show on Fox and he was\nInstrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C living die by him there\nLisa care bandit Central American migrants has turned around at the Mexico Guatemala border
