woman women are all coming in with a glass of wine a and uh\nIt wasn't pretty it it wasn't pretty uh you know they just wanted him with his shirt off and uh it's just one of the day was thought\nAnd they drink and they drink and they drank and they drank and uh when we walked out I'm not going to give away anything but it it happens in his home in the garage with the last couple of scenes\nAnd you know it's it's kind of the climax of the whole\nMovie and a and you know it it kind of is a threat that we was throughout the entire movie okay and they were standing in the lobby and again going\nOut on it that isn't what happened in the garage and they're like and the other was like I don't\nUnderstand it [laughter] I'm like\nOh [laughter] how\nDid you eat they were just so blasted but this is why you did see him with his shirt off so that was good for them to stay away from alcohol yeah I could do some really good you should see it\nUm yeah er and er it did is doing very well\nOr at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what is it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't um do I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding that movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of them planting the flag and the moon right\nI'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of the story\nI mean but the the the argument was not showing it's making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rockets and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah right um but we now and I've not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they they can fight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the just the patch or yeah which would you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you what it's not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background but it was already been planted there and they show it if somebody to avoiding the flag they just don't have that moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like has handed a\nAgain there was there already and it is so that's kind of\nAre a couple of bottles or started hey you might not understand that but I mean are we not just the victim here of of of

percent\nChance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over cabin on don't doubt for a minute this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't lead with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball Z Ford could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked at balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get

believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just and I guess it's possible I guess she does but

worked and by work I mean do two things the\nThe real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest wave for us to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they\nDid was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly and then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat one warrants such a thing but the Democrats didn't care\nThat there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy based in I'm telling you that they are\nTeetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's in\nThis universe framework context I just\nI don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to\nDo everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve this six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats\nElectoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that rock Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen or rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold that toll on Rourke race thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter he\nHas been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing that tone has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raised among yourself I'm going to bend is the way I Want money used is the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him\nHe had he wanted\nNo part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was but nice [laughter] the office of the presidency to go that low\nReal reason he didn't want to do with his mom it didn't have confidence of coattails and that ... is not going to want to share in any of his money\nNot being good socialist got all this money it's not fair that back to oh who's by the white ones he down seven or eight points not only the ... ah\nIt's not fair that Beto has more than ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do 'em yeah outlook also have the um the cars shell game situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he is Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by its purpose here is again\nThe drive by as are trying as hard as they can to link Donald
