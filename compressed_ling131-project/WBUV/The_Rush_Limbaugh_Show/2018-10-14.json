{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Remember that yeah we actually had a great opportunity to talk to someone who helped write that original four O. one K. tip Ted Turner yeah there\nGo yeah who wrote the rules I Love that yeah but you know the the reason why the four one K. was established was because companies weren't having pensions anymore and a pension from a company\nPromised a yearly check for the rest of your life right sure so what's the difference between the four one K. and a pension plan is the is the four one K. just do what you put money away tax deferred and you put money in different savings vehicles or investment vehicles\nBut it doesn't promise you monthly yearly income it get ready to I guess you're halfway there yeah so it is after journalists and the relay race of life it gets you around the track really good yeah\nBut then it's time for it to hand the baton off mhm to somebody who specializes in kicking right through retirement there you go through and so they have the fastest sprinter it had to to to get to that point but when you get to retirement\nYou need a marathon runner makes a lot of stuff and so a lot of people don't have\nThat so we need to have that yearly paycheck you know four one K. and it's not offered so how do we do it while we were all the money tax free into our own retirement plan and we built a yearly income component into their ... and if we build it right we have lifetime income for the rest of our life we can have increasing income if we use a bucket and strategy\nAnd we can also have some of that money dedicated for long term care while and if we include that into a total retirement plan we can also have something called a super wealthy transfer so that when you pass away your children will get a tax free or your spouse will get a tax free income for the rest of their life instead of taxable and we can do something called a ... plan\nWhere if you're worried about wanting to leave money to the next generation\nWhat if you could spend all the money you want it to today or this year in your lifetime short and when you pass away your children or whatever whoever your grandchildren you leaving the money to\nGet exactly or more than what you started with oh probably spent it and now you're weaving okay well that are a lot of people having to enter the snow and then and then when people see it actually in writing which it always in writing they are in disbelief number one\nThe main disbelief is not that is true because it's all backed up right mhm twenty five years in the financial never had a complaint I mean I'm not I'm not just say and stuff to say anything short of disbelief because the current plan or never told them about how in the main reason unfortunately\nAnd I have to apologize for the financial industry for this is that many advisors are compensated by keeping you at risk ... ... if you're going to a doctor and he was describing your prescription that had nothing to do with what you needed it made it may be major depressed instead of happy\nAnd you went to the doctor and say why were you were describing this for years to me and he said well compensated by the drug companies to keep you on drugs I wouldn't be surprised well that's about what we're talking about here if someone's got you in the wrong place financially and it's not helping you matter of fact is hurting you 'cause you're not building and then come play in why they're doing it\nWell it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... really search out and find folks who are you've mentioned fiduciary in the past how important is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interest 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income plan and here's what you hear\n[noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older then I started before it was the cause I'm In this financial arena and I want\nTo make sure that build myself retirement plans I was called back of the day when they the ... channel did a biography about me is beyond about our show when everything oh well\nThey called me the Mikey the financial world because I Try everything before I recommended anybody ... okay and so ... commercial and so if I'm like a human guinea pig here tests rapid and Peter Rabbit right so what are what I'll do though is I'm not talking about something on the air unless I really believe in it and\nWe unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning\nMany people are ignoring that\nAnd they're hoping that everything would just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but not only you but for your spouse and if you pass away too soon which anytime you pass away sue sue\nWe wanted we call it taken the limousine they haven't right that's right but when that happens you want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it go onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and go into someone else's pocket and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that plan built then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with it if you want yeah but what you know what people usually tell me after we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put more in it [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand Scott trade account or something like that okay and buy and sell some stocks on their own or whatever just keeps your mind sharp yeah yeah yeah and it keeps them happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still have okay they still have the more they're they're all important ... the rock is they haven't rock is there's going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and that's the way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years I see people who thought they were fine until the market rip the carpet out from under him\nAnd then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like an an ant hill over there you know in an air it's come back and rebuild but all the time that could have been building a palace precisely it however that you're having to start over again and that's what happens starting over again is not any fun now and especially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you're already have the income you need for retired\nSo you already have the money that could get your income you need a retirement but your current winner hadn't told you about it and so if you're one of the next twenty callers as we leave for the week here keeping my folks if you get a busy signal keep try and Thomas is going to give you a number out in a minute\nBut if you're one of the next twenty people who call we're going to do for you a one page financial review and this review will indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial a retirement plan and this is a very important review and it's about a nine hundred dollar value when you when you factor in all the time\nWe're going to get his way into the next twenty people no obligation were fees\nAnd is complimentary\nIf you want the next twenty people who have at least two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nNow what this will consist of is taking the mystery out of the retirement planning process by mapping out for you where you are right now we're also going to run a fee report folks and this was enlightening if not it does make you happy sometimes but will help you won tangle with working with your current planner advisor is truly costing you\nAnd to see if by simply protecting your retirement investment you could experience what we call dramatic growth potential\nYou know who hates us the analysis who's at your current advisor many time home though 'cause we expose things that the financial termites in show you what you have financial evaporation and your portfolio that doesn't need to be happening we're also going to perform attacks analysis that also could reveal how you could possibly reduce your tax is very important because the more money we can save you the more money you have for retirement what yourself\nWe're going to also run the most important part as a customizing complained that utilizes the proven pocketing strategy and strength other strategies and techniques which could turbo charged retirement income\nIf you do that folks you take the war he out of living in retirement and short will help you take the guesswork out of the financial end retirement planning process for the next twenty four hours that's a comprehensive plan to review going to give away it's a nine hundred nine dollar value no obligation getting for the next twenty callers\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nThis limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show those include inflation Social Security health care emergency so many things the stock market volatility risk taxation\nBut here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime retirement income plan has tried folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account\nNow the number to call in and meet with Paul Roberts who is coach Pete local trusted financial coach in the black sea area\nIs eight hundred eight nine one eight six eight\nZero when you call and you will receive a comprehensive retirement review that will show you where you are now but much more important it'll show you a roadmap to get you where you need to be folks there really is nothing to lose ... on and take advantage that number once\nAgain eight hundred eight nine one eighty six eighty again that's eight hundred eight nine one eight six eight zero\nVery very good show very fast show very good to have you back in the studio to what are the folks for for ... for Thomas estimates coach Pete will join your next week right here on the financial support\n[noise]\nTerrorists the reason why it was very urban says only investment tax where we live on for making up and I'm paying for that\nIt would be a

into the disappearance of a journalist I'm Pam who sales Fox News\nMuch of the world wants to know what happened to ... the Washington Post contributor who vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Germany France and Britain are asking for a complete and detailed Saudi response to us also demanding transparency\nWaters is out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there and you wrote Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part of the things some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of their brains loaded tests like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so I'm too if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly\n... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the mid [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea well\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh four of them in during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides\nOf this and that's on the Democratic side it's not gonna fade away and I think everybody needs to notice\nOn the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\n[noise] they have been mad insane crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and his cabinet situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating cabin offered her pulse he wants to see the F. B. I. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this some side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side\nUp and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I think it's only been tried like ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether to pay it or not folks I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate it's legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs\nAll weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real\nSince election night two thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current make up which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large electing Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I give me all wet they could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but\nThose that don't get it in amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their ...\nFox is gonna Scott has more live\nOh Pam economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Fox News Sunday says there's much that still needs to be known about the whereabouts of Jamal cause Yogi

looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at the American way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host\nOf reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActed on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just ... rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing because there's\nNot a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand\nShe couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking\nFor those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those

the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these

but the people in Washington live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the\nDemocrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on

exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential elections has Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they have to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your\nPrivate refuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal\nIdea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases\nAnd interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nP. S. not by you\nIn fact ... to Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere ... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is\nTo try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christ you out on for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nThat happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did

all this and civility for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it I Know what happens but it's it's a\nTo me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insane\nAnd indeed this on the ...\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh fact pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democratic Party tactics techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it
