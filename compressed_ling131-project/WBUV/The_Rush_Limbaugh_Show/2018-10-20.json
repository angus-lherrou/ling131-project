[noise]\n\nFrom them and all of us GMC studios he's he's talked for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nNancy calling me I'm Pam Susannah Fox News that's on President Trump referring to the Democrats in the Senate and house Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pearl everything\nReally nobody is heading into those places in investing and at the same time it's a defined the problem you know Americans are a good hard to people they want to help they want it they want to help the distress communities but they don't know how to what we've done is we've created a vehicle so that the people are watching the show\nRight now they can make a difference in distress communities now because what they can do is they can take the money that they have say in a mutual fund enroll it into a fund that invest in distress communities and they can make money and make a difference if the same time it's\nOkay so here's my initial reaction or there are areas that businesses are reticent to invest in there's a reason they're they're reticent to invest in those areas because it's not like they they have a chance to make money but they're just passing it up because they're hate filled out of their bigoted or whatever\nAnd so now we have a program to incentivize businesses and investing where they wouldn't otherwise invest because it's not the best use of their scarce resources that that that there's a disconnect in my head I don't understand how this is such a great idea\n[noise] well um you know let's let's let's just apply it you know in in in real world you know let's let's take a look at the city of Detroit\nThere you go that's a good one and let's say that you know whole food one drop two million dollars into a really\nBlown over section of Detroit for brand new store fresh food I think we can all agree you know all of this one fresh produce and to you know the the most underserved areas\nAnd so if that whole food that two million dollars say was pulled out of a game which is what they're talking about here where you can pull out of a mutual fund or some other invested resource and not recognize gain on that two million dollars drop it into a store\nAnd now they they develop the distribution lines and people start moving back\nThat's the key will people coagulating round that whole food store if they do with other developers come in and build tracks and build houses and and the city participates and rebuilt schools and now you've got communities than it worked\nIf that doesn't happen and whole foods loses two million dollars and it's just an empty shell in Twenty years it didn't work\nOkay boy they sure are optimistic about it and um I I have no problem criticize this administration when they're wrong and I I I just think they're wrong on this one it just I don't know it it it cars on the other side of it it's a it's like your kids\nWhen they're in a classroom and one kid's acting bad and ruined it for the rest of the kids you know you don't make the rules of the class around the bad kids it's not acting right you know you reward the anyway I just well\nThe other side of it is this whole concept of public private an investment um you know public I think will run in some instances towards the tax free incentive this this country is economics move around tax programs but will ... will the public\nFunds follow because you know even with bond issues those those those economically depressed areas\nThey're borrowing abilities limited to construct a school or construct a courthouse or something like that so you know that that the public part of it to to match up with the private seems like it's far off well we're\nGoing to find out soon enough or some of the stuff may be happening by Christmas that I Would\nGuess by Christmas or so the typical listener is going to be able to take their capital gains suppose you invested in the index five hundred a zillion years ago and you have capital game\nYou can sell that index five hundred moving in to our new opportunities own fund and not pay capital gains tax on it while you do that and so you can take your hard earned capital and put it to work making a difference in poor people's lives right away without without having to tax guy getting between ...\n[noise] yeah I'm I'm gonna wait\nUntil after Christmas I I've been waiting with you and I've been talking about this for much James I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna wait and see how it develops I'm not a and I don't I I think what he's talking about is there going to be mutual funds that are going to be developed around this I'm I'm\nI might have to read those prospectus is a little further um I'm actually more in favor of local because although I just mentioned Detroit I've never been to Detroit I'm not going to invest in Detroit\nI might invest local but what I Would I really like the most about this ball is that you don't have to go through a mutual fund or if you don't want to you can\nBring up a group of people together and they can do their own opportunities\nOn own opportunity fund and so I kinda know was cross town\nBetter than what's across the country are you here in Studio with us so if you have any

O.\nA. how you doing when he lived with Gregory rex happy Saturday on your show host James Parker [noise]\nKnow Gregory today but we have a very unique in Studio\nThat we lean on for the total wealth of the my taxes\nAnd he can answer your question or at least give it a shot five oh four to six zero zero nine Ninety five to ... that was still in in on a TV show\nThis week news with a twist you ever see that over on the ... thanks very much guys over there\nBut a long long time ago I worked there for just a short spell spell it the TV cluster and a couple of my former ... a co workers um that was like nine years ago well since then\nI started uh I I went back to the radio and then I started with Gregory like a year after that and so for the last eight years have been with Gregory when they knew me I was not a financial guru\nNow that they know me now I'm Still not a financial group but I've been sitting next to one for eight years so I can repeat a lot of stuff I've overheard and sound smart\nAnd they get themselves into some situations it just it I think it just dawned on me because I've been filling in for these guys for like a year it just dawned on him that James might have some answers and so they were peppered me with this questions and I'm going to pass it along to you to make sure I got it right one of the guys his nickname skippy so we'll just stick with that\nBut his wife's company\nHas been bought\nAnd now that it's coming under new management\nThey are resetting the four oh one case so there's some options there and he this is what he was asking me about should he take that money should he rode into the new four O. one K.\nShould take that and should he roll it over into an IRA he wants it at some point to get some Ross money working so he was one he's looking for a little bit of tax diversity there and his savings I think he's been listening to the show to be honest\nAnd so he was asking Hans ... he was asking about how um how to get that money from the four oh one K. into her off situation so\nI didn't even bother asking if the the new four one K. offered a Roth option I'm only thinking Roth IRA so I'm telling him if you take that thing you roll it over into an irate immediately\nAnd then looking at your tax brackets\nYou may want to just do pieces of that each year to keep your tax liability low even though you're going to take a little longer for it to get to work on the raw status is still going to be working under the IRA status and how 'bout\nThat so far that's just sort of the outline of what I told them that you're nodding your head yes\nSounds pretty good and you know I'm working the brackets which is what you were talking about uh you know you can make a decision at the end of each year um you know hey this I can\nI can convert this amount of money over to a Ross and still stay in the lower brackets we've got lower brackets lower individual brackets anyway with the new a tax reform\nAnd so yeah over a course of you know up until maybe the next election he could get a sizable amount of money and run off that's worth that's working for him\nAll right so ... so I'm not too crazy there now if\nIf the four one K. at the for the new company 'cause she's keeping her job it's just their their change in management if they had a raw four O. one K. option what does that look like could you convert your some of your existing four ... four one K. but\nAnd so we the similar tax it could you do the thing where you shovel the money off a little bit of a year to even want to go down that road\nI haven't seen 'em\nBreaking that out uh the the the regular four one K. too rough four one K. overeat over ... over some years so I don't know if that can be done but I Would recommend that they invest a piece of her retirement each month in the new four one K. if Roth four one K. is offered\n'cause again that's another way to just get a little bit of Roth you don't want to be all wrong when you retire but you do want to have some Roth available that way you don't have to pay the tax bill if you get close to a bracket or or something like that so I think that's a that's a great idea\nWell good because I sounded smart at the time I just didn't know one hundred percent sure if I was correct and ah you know he might have to call in on a future show and Gregory comes back we'll talk about that a little more to the phones we go by before two six zero zero nine nine five were talking to Thomas marry your next step on winning it life with Gregory ...\nIs a a tax will make any changes in the capital gains tax collect the most [noise]\nNot that I've seen Thomas I'm the collectibles tax or you're talking about\nArt and that sort of thing well in gold if you hold it long enough\nYou know that's I think that stayed the same but I'm I'm making mode of it in just check it out for you come back on the next show a with an answer for you\n[noise] okay thank you thank you thank you Tom ...\nWell I at least a year up front when you don't know the answer and yeah but the old collectibles that that was something that Gregory taught me gold counts as a collective that's right [noise]\nAll right so let's do some of these highlight calls the calls where do we wish you had been here when they call it but you weren't and so now you hear and let's do it this way we're going to start off um I Want you to respond to this this was Bob wreck back in April and we had talked to him about to believe it or not or whether a date\nBut he wanted to jump in and offered this piece of retirement advice that was tax related you you know the great Bob wreck mental weatherman from ... I'm not talking talking the guy who's listening [laughter] here he is I I I'd love to get your response to this one\nOkay I'm a little lost so she's still alive right she's put out she has\nPassed away about a two and a half years\nOkay so you're the beneficiary of the state\nOr did it get passed you before she passed away I was kind of fuzzy and I went to Gregory now\nThat the property was put into your mind\nAbout ten years ago okay\nTaken out of her name and put into mining\nAnd how was that transaction handled then you pay taxes on you know I didn't\nPay any taxes at all uh the um county a process at that time in that little town is yet French uh evidently and it was just transferred to my name with no tax implications no uh it\nWas an act of donated you placed on the on the property up any height um it was handled through an attorney and it was just put in my name and taken out of hers\nIn case so waterways selling it for now and I'm Sorry how much are we selling it for now I'm\nI'm estimating the property problems in the neighborhood of a hundred and fifty thousand or something like that\nSo and you didn't tell you a hundred and fifty thousand so your value was loaded up some more or less than a hundred and fifty thousand\nI didn't I didn't pay anything\nWas there an appraisal done at the time of the the transfer ownership I think here and then you need to speak to your accountant or Judy what I think you have is the capital gains tax on a hundred and fifty thousand well now he's here Judy we're back lives your response\nYeah and and actually we we talked about this a couple of months ago that when when this came up because I think it was a it it it it it was a call at kind of stunned a ... you know you guys is that this man is now he has the basis of his mother\nSo when you when you gift to property to someone you retain the basis of the person that gave you the property so presumably his mother um\nPurchased it many years ago doesn't didn't buy for much Gregory is absolutely right at at at the very top he's going to pay capital gains tax on about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nNo no that's that's a lot okay so what about this uh the the proposal here that would index for inflation your costs basis\nDid you see that it's not a law yet it's something that they were looking at putting in tax reform to point no and that's the so maybe she did buy that house for I don't know thirty thousand dollars in Nineteen Seventy or whatever but you would\nYou would extrapolate that out to where her costs basis wouldn't be thirty thousand dollars versus a hundred and fifty thousand dollar sell the house it would be more like eighty or Ninety thousand versus a hundred and fifty thousand dollar sale of the house that's something that I think that that has to pass soon just for ethics sake right\n[noise] um maybe I did see that um I I don't know if that's got a you know bipartisan support you have to wait and see\nYeah I don't think it does either his who who does it really helps but that's the weird thing about the opportunities um thing we were talking about earlier who does that help is is that gonna is is there a little guys out there or even middle class\nFellows who are plop down five billion dollars for our five million dollars for a new strip mall in a bad neighborhood and\nNo uh yeah we we we have to see where the money flows and then opportunities and stuff\nYeah verdict still out on that one more to run by you and I think we've asked you about this one before but this was six months ago so let's do it again okay Jay\nCovington taking my call\nI watch some money at a casino playing poker in a in a live game and I received it and Ninety nine MIST miscellaneous that up I thought they should've sent me an Ninety nine gee but they said no because they considered it because it was a jackpot\nA play poker wasn't at China\nAll right that you you want to hear the rest of this or this probably enough information to go on rides you'd\nYeah so I I I think he might have got it wrong about it being a gift um what an attendant miscellaneous is typically where they would say that it's earned income rather than a ten Ninety nine gee is just to report\nTax paid to the state so the the thing about gambling winnings is is that um for two thousand Seventeen I think this was voted out in two thousand Eighteen the new law\nBut in two thousand Seventeen you were allowed to take us miscellaneous itemized deductions all your law you're gambling losses so for most part\nOf gamblers or you know house always wins and so um you know most gamble is really don't watch professional gamblers don't really show too much a tax on their winnings at the federal level and that's why the states have been acted these ten Ninety nine jeeze\nTo pay the state taxes at\nThe time of the winnings and so you would record those with holdings as state taxes pay when you filed and uh probably get a little bit of a small refund back but yet that he he's absolutely right the ten Ninety nine miscellaneous the sad thing about that\nIs that he's going to pay a self employment taxes on that\nSo I'm In the ... just you know bad that in mind when you when when you when you're playing and sounds like he was in some sort of a a a poker tournament or something like that\nBear that in mind that was the poker tournament we didn't even finish the call you you could tell yeah it sounds like he was in poker tournaments so they identified that as earned income and so you know depending on this particular sect tax situation he might wind up paying you know an extra Fifteen point three percent self employment income\nUh on on on that money so uh yeah that's going to\nThat that might end badly for him park casino winnings treated differently is like a poker tournament versus the slot machines slot machines are typically you get just those ten Ninety nine jeeze oh we get a lot of that from the casinos on the coast where Mississippi will get their cut at the time of the the the winnings\nUh so yeah it's um [noise] the ten Ninety nine geezer primarily to pay state tax or and like I say most\nFolks that are just putting their card in the um [noise] in the slot machines they get a print out of their losses and when you look at the law says\nThat at that very few of them may have been a net plus at the end of the year most of them it's it's a net loss so you're not allowed to take gambling losses against ordinary income but in two thousand Seventeen oh you were allowed to take gambling losses against a gambling income for federal purposes\nOkay well that's not going to fly from I dropped a hundred bucks at the ... well when we went to the heart radio festival in Vegas [laughter] is that there's not that I can do about that a no no not unless you've got some gambling when ... when you just chalk that went up to the game All right Dominic in ...\nYour next up or is that Dominique and met her your next up on a winning it life at Gregory Rick's talking to James Jude how can we help you\nOkay a request for a couple of our property that I Love about selling a question if I've done a lot of my children would avoid appreciation\nYes but you know you wouldn't pay any taxes if you if just like the south Carolina call if you just transferred the property to your children but as you saw from him you'd be transferring the tax obligation onto your children as well is that kind of what you would think and\nThere were laid down the line when they go to\nCorrect that\nYes so they would retain your basis that's absolutely right you got that point correct\nThat unless you're well hey thank you very much for calling our ...\nOur past all deadlines here 'cause the fifteenth October Fifteen was the big deadline for you what what what's the the office looked like a J heath in companies well\nYeah so the fifteenth was or was nice and busy or you know plenty of folks and are now we are planning for two thousand Eighteen for all of our clients were gonna plan their taxes let them know where they stand and see if we can do by getting their taxes down before the end of the year if that's their choice\nSo what what were the story I brought up earlier of the the the friends skippy who was thinking about some strategic Ross conversions this is this is the time of year when he would take care of that right they would have to figure out what their tax liability would be before the end of the year because if they want to do it in January it's too late right so you have to do your taxes a couple of months early\nYeah this is this is the time to plan your taxes taxes 'cause after December the thirty first ... the planning is over then then you just have to pick pick what you've already done and prepare your return\nAll right my friendship with Judy he's a is\nWorth thousands of dollars to me so if you're looking for an accounting they're looking for a new accounting [noise] I'm not and toward this fellow I'm not telling you what to do you do what you want you're an adult and just saying he's done great for me Judy Jay heating company\nIs the the website so you can also find him on the winning life ... as well thanks very much you can you help us out or I'm James Parker we are when you get life with Gregory written [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom the Mandel GMC studios [noise] this is talk what over nine points and I urge radio station [noise]\nDissecting Saudi Arabia story I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nEighteen people from Saudi Arabia are under arrest as king Salman calls to the restructuring of the kingdom's intelligence service death after the stunning admission on state TV that journalist ... was killed earlier this month inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nI mean it's kind of cute that a lot of people think that that's how the world works but you and I are grown ups and we know when people say well it's just for the kids when politicians are coming up with some new program that's going to allow them to take in more money or spend more money on their behalf\nAnd they say it's for the kids you and I get totally skeptical and we know that probably bogus well the lotteries the same way\nWe have a one point six billion dollar jackpot uh if it gets above that it will break the records as the largest one is a one point five eight five billion dollar one that was from just a couple of years ago but look when you go back and study it where does the money and up\nWell for\nFor starters the mega millions profits are split between forty six different lottery jurisdictions that's forty four different states the district of Columbia and the U.S Virgin Islands now twenty seven states earmarked some or all lottery revenue for education but that's not a guarantee that educational\nDollars you're going to go up I'll get back to that and just a second to check this out in D.C the lottery dollars go just to the general fund which actually respect that I mean they're not trying to fool and if I were just going to spin out however we feel like it's so actually D.C gets to some films up for me on that one\nBecause they're at least not doing the facade in Colorado their share of the profits from mega millions goes only to environmental protection\nAnd in Kansas some of the money pays for juvenile detention facilities as well as education so see it's not all education but for most states they aim of education but here's here's the rub now here's the continuation of what it sees the second ago\n\nYeah yeah um so what happens what we see is the money that is earmarked for education and some of these other states\nSure it goes to education but the money they previously we're spending on education is now going somewhere else so the net total amount of money that's going to education\nIs staying the same for the most part it just freeze up the money they were previously spending on education to spin however they want so it's the fact that they're using the lottery money to spend it however they want\nDoes that make sense I think that make it make sense of my head I don't know if I'd set it in the cleanest way possible but to give an example North Carolina today spins a smaller portion of its total budget to education than it did before\nThe lottery\nSo look in the states like New York New York's getting three point three billion dollars in revenue from the lottery that's what they've gotten twenty sixteen the last year they had a number is available\nIt's a pretty big bait and switch yeah is it going to be three point three billion dollars to education now it's not it's not actually it's going to be a net zero for education and politicians are going to have three point three billion dollars to spin\nTop of a what they had previously on whatever they want hey let me take a as an aside here real quick just a an editorial from your your humble cohost over here I Want to thank\nSome angels in our community and they they don't get a lot of recognition there's there's no big TV program or award ceremony there's no Grammys or image for these guys but they are absolute angels and I'm Talking about little league rafts and coaches they they are [noise]\n\nI look I'm a parent and um I I have four kids they're all pretty young and this is the first year my kids have been in competitive sports and I I\nA short views and I don't deal with little kids very well I get I I Am a little kid so I I start talking to them like peers like focus\nBut the patients that these guys have to take five and six year olds on one team and then on my other team I've got a bunch of eight and nine year olds are on the my older son team\nJust to deal with these guys and get them in a huddle and try and teach us and plays I mean it's like herding cats that would drive me absolutely insane but I'm also looking out there\nAnd I'm looking at the rest and you see for each one of these games there's three guys and they have their uniforms on and they had their flags and they spent four hours out there of their friday night\nWrestling flag football for little kids no one cares they can't be making that much money but they do it because they love the game and it's it's a cool way to get back to the community and I just want to say thank you I Know there's some guys and maybe some girls out there that are listening right now that are volunteering to coach or to wrap in these little leagues\nAnd look what happened with my son's last night they both made great plays in ... they

to be from episode is three in the upcoming winning it life podcast library how to make the decision on pension versus lump sum\nMorning to buy out your pension typically they're wanting to discount it they're offering a lower number why you're probably looking at the pile of cash and say wow I can have two hundred Ninety thousand dollars\nThat kind of makes you rich for a few months but when you're thinking of living Thirty years or more in the retirement you know in let's say that pension they should have offered three hundred and fifty thousand because that's what it takes to generate that income\nAnd this is a spouse soul consideration as well it's not just you if you're married there is a spouse so will that income continue so when I'm thinking of taking pension and\nTom there's not often I'm going to go another direction other than a hundred percent spouse so continuation so when we're looking at the lump sum\nOne reason we would look at a lump sum and take the pinch and instead it's a permanent income that goes on through spouse I don't look at the single life payout that's not a correct number because you could die too much into retirement what happens to the pension James serve\nYeah boom poof splash it's gone so we want to consider\nIf you got a financial situation and you're not quite sure what to do better call Gregory\nOne of the things I'm going to
