Days away two weeks ago from yesterday Tom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political\nScientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics that was among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval\nIs rising Democrats are in the advantage that says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup\nOf twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor\nTrump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap\nAll of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past me cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is the great unknown as

discovered\nThe Democrats the urban crime and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and like video that\nCame out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked what makes you think that they wouldn't\nSomething that will tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that\nWay it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning leaves elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around what\nDoes it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it then they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the up the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue\nIt is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and your watch or we're going to do Hillary and be of domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\n... it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar\nBut see that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately\nNeed to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt I used to the rush\nTo excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an
