instinct of the drive by\nMedia has\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first instinct they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I Walk out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years\nOr showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up when it then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie\nAfter lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to impose it on substantive grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the falls into political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they\nCan to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from a weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\n\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out in his mind your men to pay attention to it it is my\nMan to come here and pay attention to it tells you what I think

the midterms are going to pretend the rats at least two things\nUp to try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ... do not know it from a exact hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri\nAnd and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that in ... the Mike Brown good what is the first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store and so whatever they just totally making up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald

year old allegation can be made for which there is no evidence for which for supposedly witnesses candy been placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't aware it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh is supposed\nTo sit back and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington people under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how\nResponsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll like that and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was mayor and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\n\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nAre probably the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arming the school police and it was voted down to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things that happen before they realized it more gun control markets are not putting someone with a gun the can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of ...\nOh there's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than\nThat it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us left us [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with a [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified I'm only a cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit see sowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things\nAnd anti Semitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nSilent crime it's why people have life like half life luck to protect them from every kind of

[laughter]\nWell there was one of the reason I ask you about specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if the religion air time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal Israel comes that no way that I did this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that it yeah that comes up and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel as a poke 'cause if their entire religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward Indians that many theaters they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nSee them as necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I Do the right guy\nThat's exactly right I says where Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate power that can meet out\nApprove or disapprove hurtful ones X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so\nHow this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThe all the liberalism creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she got the thing is I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so good that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything like that I Am\nGlad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much Rachel I precepts racial from thousand\nOaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact\nThat that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happens\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains [noise]\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with this\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they but ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started\nThe president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the left is concerned\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes ... says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants\nThis isn't an
