Simon Ellen Langer European bureau\nDown his nose up but they didn't care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one since Obama was\nEnabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today\nHe said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation in murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when snugly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even who handle watched don't even know that watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time they're right\nBut if you're a watch learns a why finding work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together but only\nIf you have answered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't want to and you have to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how is your a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's mostly they they say the show was recorded the events have have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] neither headline you probably have seen this\nSo should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\n\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the

should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see I got rid of Fox willingly

couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact of the election\nEarly events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the cabinet are scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\n\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\n\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned shocked where is but rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama is going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama would put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue waiver at why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a couple of stories Democrats upset whereas Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign in this situation because of the blue wave is not a lock and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have coattails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it do you want\nA third term of mud and others brush if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened\n... Trump wasn't match it laid it not Hillary Rodham run 'em and\nSo he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time\nTwenty days so the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they\nTell about it here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections president\nDonald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview than wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those\nYou know they're always a wide ranging interviewer three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses or beauty outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nCan I read the transcripts of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP lose his house\nSet it half a million dollars for a bottle of our county woman in the death of her granddaughter who's body was found in a hot oven forty eight year old Carol and Jones of Shaw is charged with first degree murder\nWas trying to make sure we have all the\nThat needed to bring justice for victims\nSheriff Kelvin Williams says twenty month old royally Murray Floyd had been living with Jones a child had been stabbed but investigators are waiting on an autopsy report to see if she was still alive when she was placed in that up in\nA Mexican woman faces up to ten years in federal prison after being arrested on I can for transporting illegal aliens\nBeatrice Martinez via sonnet has admitted she was carrying fraudulent identification cards for the car was pulled over by a border patrol agent in Jackson County back in July she'll be sentenced in January\nIn Hattiesburg another arrest has been made in a shooting that left three people injured\nBut make six arrest so far the latest suspect in the case Twenty one year old Victoria McDonnell she liked the others is charged with hindering prosecution she's also accused of rendering criminal assistance police are still looking for three other people\nIn connection with that October seventh shooting and Mississippi State lottery has not been set up yet\nSo we still have to drive across the state line to buy tickets\nNumber tonight and last night a big jackpot got even bigger after there was no winter mega millions game will be worth released eight hundred sixty eight million dollars when the next drawing has held on\nFriday that's going to make it the second largest jackpot in us history by the way tonight Powerball jackpot is only three hundred and forty five million dollars in Europe today now a new stock one oh four nine W.

Don Mueller's wrapped it up my mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I got to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe that it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWhen mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made\nPublic so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really here and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation any should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well and that shocked you ride\nYou know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed at frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't do it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and that you know like your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the race\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up on my machine aging my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it than you may know\nAnd of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse\nWhy about it and you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that I think it's also helping get the truth about Trump's a cheap\nTo take a

newspapers in the current era in this modern day and it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very curious to take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\n... trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig\nPeople powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that is the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists the U.S a call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking\nTo some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that

is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure\nBut the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you it was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in
