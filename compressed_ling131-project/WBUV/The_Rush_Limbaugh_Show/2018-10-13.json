Fox News that in a tweet from President Trump plans to meet this afternoon in the oval office with American pastor Andrew Brunson Brunson is heading home to the U.S after being held in Turkey for nearly two years on charges related to espionage and terrorism\nCertainly you want to get ... on it but also you definitely want to get some financial advisor um to come in and take a look at it as well\nI I feel like I Need to catch up some of the novice listeners here or without the trust on an action there's really two ways\nAn IRA can be distributed when it's inherited one is take the stretch option which you'll have a device or that you divide into it it's like thirty seven or thirty six point for depending on your age or whatever and um\nIt is that the visor goes up at one every year\nUntil all the money's out so if if like my advisor here I think mine we just did this last week so my advice would be like thirty seven or forty seven 'cause I'm expected to live 'til I think a for is what Social Security expects at this point so it's whatever that number of years is that when you get to the last year the device or will be one and you'll take everything out\nAt that point you're empty it so it'll last for you know thirty sometimes forty years if the guy's young enough\nUm the other option though as you call it the lump sum but it doesn't necessarily have to be the lump sum you could take it all out right now or you would just really have to have the money out\nAnd is it a sixty months simply so yeah so it's a it's a five calendar year\nSituation and so what what happens then is a lot of people will say All right I Would like to take all this money out but in order to separate the taxes so I don't get the max bracket I'll take out thirty thousand this year thirty thousand next year next year and next and so they keep their tax bracket management low to where if you took it all at this year\nYou would end up paying thirty seven percent on that top bracket whatever's over the big the biggest number there\nSo those are your two existing options and you were just saying that this gives you more options you could force them to do the stretch option which is\nFinancially speaking mathematically speaking probably the most prosperous thing they could do with it however the stats at Gregory has is it's more than Seventy percent of people take the lump sum out and they have all the money out within a year or two yeah like they don't even do the proper sixty month thing where they spread out the tax it for a couple of years\nAnd and I think in in reality it it's pretty understandable as long as you get proper advice and counsel on what it means tax wise and you're willing to to take that lump um you're fine with you know taking it and\nI I guess it's everyone's perspective it's had different you know if you either need that money now and it can change your life immediately or you know you're you're kind of comfortable where you're at and you can afford to sort of let it play out over time and maybe even you know help help with the kids if you know if if you\nWind up or not making it past the life expectancy and so those are things that again you want to get proper guidance and you don't just want to be having that conversation with 'em\nWant it to your friends and loved ones you don't go get some professional help and make sure that you can understand the ramifications because it's a huge financial decision you know Gregory talks all the time about when turning on Social Security and and why that such a big\nDeal people think well sixty sixty two to sixty seven to Seventy ... I mean what difference does it really make the need the money now but when you break down the amount of money that you would receive it the longer you wait the multiplication that happens year over year you realize what a massive decision that isn't so\nJust that and then of itself is worth going to get some advice and trying to I guess get your temperature taken on what your um your pain threshold is\nHow long are you willing to wait can you wait do you plan on continuing to work the ... needed as much as you want it you know and having that sort of conversation with an independent party rather than just with\nYourself you know something else I learned in that a segment there with Gregory is that you can call it this claiming it's more like on claiming to me I I don't know if there's got to be a better word but it's like take it a pass\nLike when you're playing patch your luck you know do you want to risk another way me and hit the stop or you just want to pass or the next guy so there are situations where people are a trustee will come up to beneficiary and say hey you're all this money you want a hundred thousand dollars you know just give it to the next guy that happens it's\nCrazy to think that sometimes\nOne thing I Would suggest is you need to do a little bit of homework you need to go look at your outflow from your checking account the past six months now sometimes people pay their bills on a quarterly basis or why probably my insurance one year old in the house\nWill go back a year and average it out to see what you're needing to pay and then you have a handle because now that tells me the number so now we have to go back look at your overall income need wars that fit in tax brackets and get to a gross number\n... associates Gregory races in investment advisory representative through global financial private capital vital for a three to nine to zero zero or Gregory ...\nDot com to question do you have a pulse dealing anything\nIf you said he has to vote you probably need a will you may even need a truck we all know a lawyer [noise] you know someone who specializes in estate planning do you really trust the husband of your sister's friend from college would you feel better putting your family in the hands of the estate planning attorney\nOf a total wealth authority on west Blanchard what's your plan officers ... and that W J Blanchard law dot com\n[noise] he liked money you will love the winning at like if you want to call the shell or tax ... life right now if you need to contact Gregory ... or any of the total wealth authority on to ask if you would like to stream the shell lives for on pie cat\nSat on the ... it's just a one ton log in all it takes to join the winning at like nation of winning at\nYour wallet favorite app\nThanks for listening to winning it live by doing so you have joined an elite demographic of people who tend to be more successful in their careers have higher levels of education and or generally winters James Parker here would you like to get the\nMessage out about your awesome business in the tens of thousands of other winners six days a week from Baton Rouge to the cola beyond the winning team asked\nComey about advertising reasonable rate\nHands and stuff and and an army of winter email Jane\n... dot com [noise] this is a\nFox News alert I'm Karen McHugh pastor Andrew Brunson is back in the usa the American clergyman had been held captive and espionage charges by turkey for the past two years is released secure just yesterday by the Trump Administration he's slated to meet with the president and the oval office this afternoon the president tweeting that there was no deal made an arranging Brunson released\nMeanwhile President Trump says Saudi Arabia will pay a price if it's found they were involved in the disappearance of journalist ... in Turkey\nSo far show he went to the ...

[noise]\nYou've been saying you need to get it together time to call Gregory winning at life with Gregory wrecks on news talk one oh four nine W. B. U. V.\nNow you don't want to get life with Gregory Rick [noise] this is the money show host James parts for Gregory [noise] having a hard\nTime getting his LSU game today so it's just a myself hosting but I got ... studio for the rest of the hour we brought in a total ... member here to provide a little expertise in his uh arena is estate planning is the estate planning attorney of the\nTotal wealth authority and he also has sort of a special place around here because uh uh Gregory Rick's life he's the only other guy that really gets a segment of time to uh\nDo significant amount of speaking and learning and why why are you the one of all the total wealth authority and all the other people we worked with a year or the one that he brings in on the Gregory bricks live and you get a whole segment to explain what\nWell I think the reason it's so closely connected as kind of what what I talk about it the event is\nEstate planning and financial planning or really hand in hand and I guess the way I view it is an estate planning a sort of a capstone for your financial point\nUm and I explain at the same way at the seminar to to kind of start out the the the talk there but um if you're going to spend all the time or making sure that your money get you through your retirement\nAnd then you know if you're fortunate enough obviously to have a substantial portion your assets available to you even when I'm you and your spouse pass away well the next question is how are we going to make sure that it gets where I Want it to go\nYou don't want to leave it up to Louisiana's default rules um they may not likely won't a\nPass it on to your heirs in the fashion that that you would deem best and so\nAgain just as simple as the plane is going to get you into the door um of of having that happen but you know there's a lot more um that you can explore that that really makes it easier on your heirs or helps you to accomplish certain goals with regard to um asset distribution legacy and grandchildren and\nPets I mean look at that's becoming more and more frequent uh so you know there's a lot too and I think they're they're pretty tightly connected because again you don't want to spend all the time I'm\nHaving that that financial discussion a and having you know the the the sort of constraints put on you to help you retire well and then ultimately you know it's all for naught after you passed away and she said pets that happened to me I'm telling you\nThat and look you know look I've got a dog at home and I love 'em to death and you know I\nI I haven't if he's not in my will um\nBut you know I I have two cats but that being said you know for for folks who don't have children um\nOr you know have children who who don't need it in or maybe have a a young pat and they just want to see to it that look you know someone takes care of the dog dog cat wherever maybe takes care of me so helps me a you know wake up happy every day and so there's something to that\nDrought so if you have any uh financial situations or as you say estate planning questions not quite sure what to do was this year\nFive four to six zero zero nine nine five lost will be the next Gregory Rick's live November fourteenth so if you're thinking about coming out and meeting the crew and finding out of Gregor Rick's associate should handle your money you'll meet them there are a CPA Gregory Rick's dot com or the ... the winning it like that or do some of these phones over here Celeste\nNew Orleans your next step on winning it lives with Gregory Rick stocking James and west how can we help you Celeste\nHave a question my sister recently guy on even though she has three\nGrown children want to find out what I'm trying to her and I'm just from talking to people some people were saying he cannot\nOr Harry how much she had like a large our aid if stripped ocean ... um you know what I was trying to find out do they have the money even with him because he you're incarcerated for life she's not entitled to you know his part of it [noise]\nSo that's that's actually the crux of the question is what he's in jail for if he's been um the law lives that he can be just inherited a if he's been convicted of a crime for which law provides that the punishment could be life imprisonment or death so from what you're alluding to is you know\nWas it sort of an effective uh life imprisonment you know it's a fifty years sends and he's you know fifty or is he actively I'm In prison for life\nOn the phone number here\nYet and so I think there there is a case to be made 'em that that he can be this inherited a from that and so you know it's something you definitely want to sit down and and see if there's a you know\nIf it's worth pursuing it sounds like it would be if there's a large IRA and you know we're talking about cutting one of the kids out um that effectively cuts the uh the pie and you know makes it half instead of a three way pie there and and\nIt's probably worth the money um to look into it a little bit I\nI Want to get married and I was just wondering do they automatically\nI Know it's not just share it with my guest\nRight and yeah let me let me be clear it's not automatic um it it it was a law allows for that to happen but it's not automatic\nOkay All right that's what I was trying to find out sure oh All right so last our nation\nSay thank you very much for calling and we really appreciate you listening with us on a Saturday if you want to be after Celeste five oh four to six zero zero nine nine five so what are the rules around that like if if you're in prison and you can inherit a bunch of money what happens to it\nAbsolutely I mean well it it you know it's yours at the end of the day and\nThey don't give it to you in cash and you have to keep it under your pillow fight off your Sally all day right\nNo but I mean you know you I guess you have it you know more commissary money than your competitor is I suppose I'm OK but also you know it's probably probably time to find that ... lawyer and write a will\nOkay yeah and and look that's honestly that's what we see the most is dogs because cats you know I'm a dog guy but at the end of the day you know cats are a little more self sufficient\nUm and so you know if you are is there anything like like mine there you know they're all over the they want you to be around all the time and so are you really want to do is make sure that you know they're living their best life and so that's that's what we often see when clients come in and look you know we have someone in mind\nWho would take the dog or dogs um but you know the dogs are expensive especially if they're if they're hunting dogs right so they need particular\nA treatment care food thing in the like like that so um it definitely becomes a bit of a burden so you can provide for\nFunds I'm to be given to that person so that you know hey they're taking on the dog but they're also not coming out of pocket you know the dog has medical issues and\nThings like and you get up and you're saying you could accomplish all that with a will just these these atrocities probably save a little trouble\nYeah for the most part I mean again you know the trust is made to the kind of schedule the money or the distributions and things like that but again you're talking about someone who's taking your pets the chances are if you're going to trust them to take on take on the pet you're going to trust them to use money for the pet I mean you know you don't really want to die too far into it\nIs that what you're looking for Mike yeah uh I just wanted about you know that much to leave for animal or\nJust to them so I have a friend it would be willing to take them and then the excess mount money that they can just keep you know it when they all passed away mhm that you get the\nBulk of it whatever you know write and read it or whether there'll be arranged the boy will or in a trust and that's all right it was quite sure\nYeah I wouldn't I wouldn't go as far as the trust with it as far as the particular dollar amount and again I think it's going to sort of depend on um you know the type of animal the animal itself with the life expectancy is and again you know\nYou're talking about self like hunting dogs you know your friends going to need a lot more um than it would have if you're taking care of your lab um so you know there's there's some things you know outside factors that you need to consider when arriving at a dollar value but\nThat is typically will we see as we leave a a chunk of change to the person who's going to take the dog on and then you know if that money is not expended on on the dog itself I'm all passes away or you know it's that person's to to keep as a thank you for for taking the dog on\nAll good might ... one of the question of I'm sure\nThat uh okay just inherited real kids that's Foley is a truly\nUm so you can you can just inherit um children uh as long as they are over the age of\nTwenty four what that's in Louisiana rhetoric you're you've got your Mississippi bar now is that the same story over there\nUh you know we're going to wait on that I'm not quite barred just yet I have to um actually have to pay the fees I'm so wants to have noticed pass the test yeah pass the test so there's still some red tape but I'm\nLike if they're over twenty four um you can just inherited him or her own your own your own whim or you just need a will to do it otherwise uh the the regulatory um last put in place by the legislature are gonna gonna give them their their fair cut so that's really what you want to do\n[noise] okay you have written into will that they did some heritage each one of\n... or ...\nYou can do both are either one is going to have the same effect typically we we do include in there for clarity purpose um that look we we know obviously we have children we know that they're still around um but we're not including them in in our state distribution and so we don't\nTypically leave a reason absent you know some some sort of requests by the by the person\nAnd that will um so we just we make mention but um we also let them know that we intend for everything to go elsewhere\nOkay okay well thank you very much appreciate\nNo problem my thanks to tough there Mike I was a lot packed into three minutes a stick with phones mark is calling from New Orleans as well you're on when you get life is Gregory Rick's talking to James in West what can we do for you mark is\nGoing to James are you a question I have a you get so confused and starting to go since succession now uh I don't understand this\nWent three pieces of property in Mississippi about was my dad to give it to my mom I'm Out of the we'll put it on to us but in that process my oldest sister passed away and back in may\nHad senator writes on this I quote a attorney whatever you call it a good job of turned me whatever power of attorney should\nPass away she created a will but there was no mention of his three properties\nSo the guy here in town the lord that we go to\nIs asking about this to us and the guy in Mississippi the lawyer who were trying too hard to uh sell this properties\nA that say ... I don't get my understanding is\nThat for all this fall is left of five children the ones that are the same signature in Mississippi passed away so not all four of us are going it\nWas a big deal so from my point of view because I'm very skeptical about everything I think the larger just trying to hit us with a higher percentage off\nOf ... percent of the health of the cell what ... is that you guys do I my oldest sister the one that's doing this year she was about ... about everything but she does uh\nShe she only had their job to have a lot of one actually when say no shortage coming for the past three years is still working\nA sort of do is I Try to figure out what's the problem what I'm saying for my point of view\nAgain is is that I'm very skeptical about all this here is that the lawyers are trying to hit us with our percentage of what the cells or this other property should be I mean I say we should have made him two hundred and eighty thousand dollars or they're talking to a hundred and twenty\nAre now by on their back I went over there went through a a a a a proper yourself person band I went\nTo him showing the ... I mean he says well okay good he he said the problem is worth at least three hundred and thirty thousand dollars a minimal because of the calls or so or larger city and also now says hot I cleaning the ... in front of wood L. L. there's good points that he made\nSo that in one hundred thousand dollar difference to me\nUh and that's what I mean ... when from my dad's mom or my mom\nTo all of us and they were the poppy we'll pay for a a\nTax on the property is completely up today it has never gone you know not paid for the for profit of ... ... it was actually one big chunk of property\nThey altogether in the same area so I don't know I I is there a difference between how a\nLouisiana sees this thing's ... which was so busy this things because once again the lawyer votes of the ... the guy here in Louisiana\nAnd he always where where's the property and Mississippi out that way and\nMark is I think that the main issue that you're having seems to be on the valuation of the property right so\nAs far as the will is concerned and who inherits what that's all going to be determined to um if if everyone's living in Louisiana there they're asked that there are states are going to be governed by Louisiana law now you're still going to have to go through um\nSome sort of succession process out there uh in order to get that that probably so that's why there's going to be a Mississippi attorney involved but none of that really seems to matter from your perspective what you seem to be concerned with is evaluation of the property I can tell you this a lawyer is not going to help you with that\nIt's not that they that they don't want to is that they be guessing they're not appraisers and that's what you need you need to hire an appraiser in Mississippi and appraiser in Biloxi Gulfport wavelength whoever it may be and they are going to give you a true value on the property is probably going to cost somewhere around foreign fifty dollars\nIf you want a true independent third party evaluation and it sounds like that's going to be with\nSolve your problem that the need to contact the appraiser bang for the call mark is good stuff [noise] pay a Veronica you might hanging on west you gonna can you stay to the break here and help around with one more football's calling in the\nBible for two six zero zero nine nine five I'm James Parker we got the estate planning attorney Leslie injured in Studio ... we are winning electric Gregory rich\nFrom the men do viewing GMC studios he's talked for nine points and I urge radio station\n[noise] Fox News alerts and American story is home I'm Pam who sounds pastor Andrew\nBrunson or riding a joint base and for the Washington one day after being released from turkey where he had been held for nearly two years on espionage and terrorism charges about Ninety minutes from now Brunson is scheduled to meet with President Trump inside the oval office President Trump tweeted\nRight so yeah it is as far as the the portions of percentage I'm it's going to be tied to a back to the siblings and things like that as far as when mom died now the value of that percentage is definitely tied to today's money for sure [laughter]\nOkay so so that the house was worth a hundred thousand back there then and it's worth\nHundred thousand now so he be entitled even though nobody else has put any money into this house except my friend who um [noise] it goes back it goes to how much it's worse now\nYeah it certainly goes back to how much it's worth now because his his ownership interest vested\nAnd as the asset grows so so does the value of his ownership interest however your friend is able to um I guess you some of the law that that or he can he can avail themselves that he's I'm\nEntitled to reimbursement for some of the expenses that he he put out so for things like paying paying insurance or in the necessities in other words if he's continued to put money into that and he's been the only one will he can ask for reimbursement I'm\nBen Taylor owners correct correct because most of that stuff's going to be deemed to a necessity it sounds like so\nI'm unless we're talking like simple aesthetic improvements um if we're talking again things like insurance is a\nYou know necessities ah regarding the house he can get some of that money back so\nHe can use that as sort of a a chip in the negotiation with the sibling to say hey well\nLook you know over the years I've been paying out all these money certainly maybe even a portion of your property tax or to the extent that you know your share is Ben\nI'm really overtaken by the amount that I put out on it so it's not you know a clear cut hey I got to give you let's say a quarter just for for ... I got to give you a quarter of the value of this\nUm he can definitely run a tally of what he's put into it and some of that you know he may be able to be reimbursed for it not all of it but some of it\nOK sound like property taxes and insurance that in the house now itself\nI Would think major repairs to I have to reply room for\nEvery member right yeah that's right that's right and again it's all it's all reduced by his fraction of ownership interest but yeah it's not as if\nYeah I guess when when I first hear you say he's put money into it I think they put a swimming pool in the back no but if he's done the necessities like paying down the mortgage no absolutely qualifies property taxes flood insurance\nMajor home repairs those are the kinds of things that yeah he can he can ask for a reimbursement for and potentially again use that as a sort of an equalizer and paying out his siblings\nYou know the the Weinstein other member of the total wealth authority just texted any apparently is listening or he just says perfect example people getting bad advice and not knowing the law to do it holds out\nIt's his portion period but but check this out um you need to buy 'em out so you can't give them cash you can refinance ... and have him sign his rights away at ... at the refinance and it's right\nAnd and he did he get along and that's why we we have never known that that there was a problem\nIs that when when everything a kind of came to light was during the refinance\nAnd when they would be not only she signed the refinance\nWent through a when what king was when we got a property tax now saying that I'm here of course his mother's portion of the property tax was allowed because um it's two people on the street\nOr even that's all right that that aside that just how we ended up in this mess but if you combine the the wisdom of West Blanchard in plain sight you you can reduce what his portion is by by claiming all these other expenses so you know ... you\nKnow

we're going to talk about a couple of scams that got busted [noise]\nOne of the trust male you know when you see those advertisements on TV and they're like yeah this is an estate planning\nA service here come to our advantage to teach all about estate plans and get your state plan worked out last Gregory when I first started the show eight years ago what what what's those commercials really bad business or a trust\n... they're just uh and and they're not even there to make the trust actually there to sell annuities so they pretend to be an estate planning service and there's usually know estate planning attorney on staff\nAnd then they try and put you in these trust and it's really all about selling you the the fixed annuities and the the new products that are going to go into the trust and\nSeems like a really round about way just to get a bunch of commissions are selling us some insurance products doesn't it well that's that's part of the explanation there\n[noise] but ah it listen if you have financial situation not quite sure what to do download the winning it live at and ... maybe Gregory sought available right now at this second but you can go ahead and call his office and leave a message there is an ... an ... after hours team\nThat still answers your calls you can go ahead and send them a message that goes to him and sure he might be a little drowned out in a LSU Georgia football the day but he'll get to it\nOr you can go to our YouTube channel start looking at the stuff we put out before you start looking to our podcast seem to get some answers there the winning it life at your wallets favorite at\nFirst and foremost it happens to more often be in these financial scams you're more likely to be a man that's number one [noise]\n\nAnd they will them some there can't be like a biological reason for that well I mean yes and no but it all homes down to one of the basic differences between men and women and men are far more aggressive\nAnd it's that sort of trade in fact when they do the personality tests on these people in these studies the less aggressive you are the less likely you are to get scanned and that makes a lot of sense if you're not\nWilling to take risk you know some sounds a little shady if you're not aggressive person you're not gonna take it this matchup what you see yeah\nYeah for the most part here's something else interesting it's also ... are more likely to be someone who is Seventy or older wow yeah and there's a couple of thought processes behind that but it's so hard to get in the head on on the whys of some of these but younger people\nThey have a susceptibility to scams because they're inexperienced and that and seen a whole lot of scams and you know your your stove nature gets scams kind of raises in the middle of life but then it falls off sharply at the end for a couple of reasons for one reason they believe technology passes people by they don't\nWant to admit it they don't want to admit they don't understand something especially men eight Seventy or so\nAnd they're also trying to chase something really quick they're running out of time how am I going to retire how am I going to leave something to my kids I'm not going to have any kind of legacy if I don't make a big move right now and they're trying to make a big splash you know as in their golden years yeah yeah\nBut you wouldn't think it was because these are the guys you think would be scanned the least I think of how much much more street smart you are at this age than you are when you were sixteen now at about twenty more years of that do you think you'd be better but here here's where it gets really interesting you are far more likely to be a victim\nOf a scam if you've been scammed before\n[noise] more likely that the head flapper\nIsn't it so it's not once but twice shy probably four or five times bitten then you're ...\nI ... ... ... many of these things are surprisingly\nI that's that blew my mind but that's that's why I thought to be super important for the show because listen to it if you're if you're a man over Seventy and you know you're aggressive and and this this hits you you know I thought oh my goodness I'm struggling trying to leave a legacy I'm trying to trace returns and trying to make up some lost ground\nYou know for my my lack of a financial success that's far you need to be extra aware\nBecause you don't want to admit sometimes and technology passes you by or if someone comes up with credit default swap for some new scam that you don't entirely understand you're used to be in the elder statesman in the room you used to be in the guy that everyone starts there and says hey explain this and you usually have a good answer for it\nAnd it's so hard to admit I have no idea what that financial product does that you know how this works as a variable\nReal estate something rather trust or something and uh yeah no I understand that front back sounds good and you're just not in your head yes but in the back of your mind like I don't really know what's going on a younger people run from that women Ron from that\nFact women actually have a really good track record of not\nBeing scammed they um they're more likely to be victims of financial abuse\nWhich is a little bit different financial abuses usually when a caretaker a family member or someone you trust\nOr you give them financial access and they miss use it against your will so women you get caught up because you have too big of a hearts and you're too trusting with the people you know\nMen get in trouble because they're too aggressive and they trust people they don't know too much but that yeah that that was a big shocker to me especially the one about if you've been scammed before\nAnd a lot of that uh they they're they're guessing again this is the sauce science here it's sort of that gamblers downward spiral where if you've been at the black Jack table and you're a hundred bucks down on now you really have to start playing hard so you can when your money back and then you two hundred dollars down and said well I Can't leave now I've got to win some of this money back from going to go home of
