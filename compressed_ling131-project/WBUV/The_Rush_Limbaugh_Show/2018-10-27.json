I don't even like you're looking at the straight number but we're going to plug those numbers and if there's another pension when does it turn out so that gives us some basis of numbers and if we're short\nFrom those income that are coming in then we're going to plug in water we taking from the assets what do I mean assets you know the savings you have the non qualified\nMoney you've put away for retirement that are raised the four one K. ...\nThose tools that you have do you have any other income sources we haven't\nTalked about so wherever we're short ... we're going to look at polling income or distributions from those assets and we might look at are we starting with our race or are we blending it do you have a good mixture of pre tax money\nTax free money an expert tax money will look at how to blend that or if you're really loaded up with\nAll pre tax money means everything to tax as ordinary income so that gives us a different tax look as well then what about required minimum distributions you know I'm looking at one here where the individuals are uh early sixties so it means and\nLooking Fifteen Years out of Fred here he said sixty two which means in your Fifteen he's going to be Seventy six so we're having the fact okay what are the required mental distributions watch that\nWell that's a number when you turn suddenly and a half there is a minimum a male the\nGovernment are ras treasury are expecting you to take out of that account which means that's a taxable\nEvent that could also ... ... even when you're not meeting it so we have cases where that helps that people's needing it sometimes it gets too big so we go to like water ... what can we do to reduce that back in maybe take more on the front of you\nOr I really don't need it but you've got to take it what and yet bounces your tax bracket up that's why you see\nAll these things we need to talk about\nThis it and come in shove the statement across a desk what can you do for me well we're gonna do mathematical planning we're going to talk about all these\nThings are going to talk about reasonable expectation of return we're going to look at all the income sources and see how that is affecting the assets sometimes conversation leads to as you don't have enough assets to retire in January and generate that income without spend now\nIf you're going to spend out are you still going to have money at age a hundred and ten that's what we would hope for some cases gosh I'm going to have more on a three percent return at a hundred and ten so we could really conserve a number\nAnd assets can take off what I've got lots of questions and you don't even probably know all the questions asked I'm going to help you with that so you can look at all these different things and have truly an understanding of where you're going to be then we'd get in to what your risks number\nHow do we love awhile volatility these are all things that you need to know from an income planning standpoint and our three I'm going to touch on how we pulled this together in a particular case for Fred\nAnd talked about that 'cause we're that spreadsheet print out what do you call it what's that system called the guided planning cyst hadn't said that all segment just want to get out at it but yeah okay yeah the guided planning system I love doing that stuff income planning\nAnd just putting everything together and that's not a software package that Gregory went and bought a best buy is a proprietary system that you develop we've developed over the past dozen years program a spreadsheet pretty good huh All right I I had help quite a bit of help\nI so doing science our guest coming up in the next hour\nHost of mortgage gumbo which comes on after the show on this station he's the mortgage guy for the total over forty\nAnd we've got a lot to talk to this guy\nWill the fed slow down their rates raising in this new volatility area\nEvery finances stop with the rates going up\nAnd he's going to cover some miss a reverse mortgage despite all four to six zero zero nine Ninety five I'm James Parker we are winning it life with ...

I see that in any form or fashion were at three percent tenure treasuries now ... what is your thirty year fixed for ... for point nine five\nAnd you're jumbos jumbos at four point three eight\nAnd yeah it's going to go up so that should be making preparations not necessarily I I'm I'm gonna wait to see if the textile I Do not see that coming maybe they increases might slow a bet on next year and maybe not\nYeah you could say that you we could see it ... the two year treasury could easily be a one percent higher by the end of next year or so then ... where you're at your approach you're five and a half the six mortgages well listen we're\nLocking were locking people win at five point seven five and six percent when I'm telling you full point not for that's not Joe blow that walks off

doubt did I get into a three point eight seven five mortgage she stole money we were taught number what we were describing just a short time ago but I've got four percent on a jumbo us\nWe'll look a little bit further down road which we stole a ... percent on a jumbo yeah flak oh wow and when we were talking\nAbout looking five ten years these are going to be amazing rates well we're not even five years out I guess I'm five years from my house purchase but these are already amazing grace and\nWell but I understand is to the arm the five one on right because you know and I know I get calls all the time well should should I or look at an interest only or should I look at an adjustable rate mortgage no because the five one five year on right now is that full point four or five\nSo why in the world for less than a half a point would you put something where we all who knows where we're going to be in five years\nYou know so why in the world would you even think about doing something like that\nYeah I Wonder if that arms is going to go up\nWell it it every week it's going up which is odd because it ... the ... over history when I used to ... you know always keep an eye on his\nAss

B. U. V. [noise]\nThis is the weekly route host Gregory wreck [noise]\nThe talk radio we have Weinstein hosts the mortgage gumbo was the remainder of this hour James Parker\nIs here in Studio as well I'm your host Gregory Rick's call us bubble four to six zero zero\nNine nine to five you know we've been talking about interest rates so I'll throw at a thought here here's one of the\nBiggest problems we're facing out there and it's the student loan debt crisis so we're talking about interest rates going up it's the a consumer\nLoan area\nYou know household loans that's the continuous largest growing segment of that since the great recession their student loans are the fastest growing segment of household that seeing a hundred and\nFifty percent increase since the great recession and now they're facing let's see what is the U.S\n[noise] you know we've got ... you know student loans currently faced highest Ninety plus delinquency rate of all households that\nAnd I think the real ... straight movement there that\nYou know they're seeing interest rates go up on subsidized loans jumped to five percent this year the highest rate since two thousand and nine and professional degrees now face six point six percent interest rate according to the U.S department of education\nThat mobiles going to pop oh it\nThere's no ... yeah I even got into the private for profit colleges and those that\nAre going to get a degree and don't complete that process that's where the highest of faults are\nAs well but just a matter of interest rates moving up and we've seen how that compounds and they're getting behind the curve they're getting disillusioned and there's no escape patch\nYeah and I know and we've talked about it with with the wind and joins talked about mortgage gumbo is this is affecting the overall\nEconomy well\nAnd that ... that's one of the things we hear Dwayne telling the stories of people who are refinancing their house getting some cash out to help the kids with college or to pay off their own\nDebts and so coming back to ... you were explaining 'cause I'm a cursory look with the rates going up you would think refinances that business would slow down or they're you know there's at least an incentive to not keep it up but you're saying people are still doing ... left and right and you were starting to explain it but we got in a commercial but how does that work\nWell it here here's why okay a couple of years ago when rates were at all time low see is what you had okay\nYou had anybody that could fall Camaro end alone business okay and you had people that are out there who said yeah let me do a a a rape term refinance which basically means James calls me and says hey I'm sitting at four and a half percent\nBut I Want it to a Fifteen year note at two point eight seven five what with the order takers did was they just lowered their no they didn't maybe look at their entire picture and said Well James has got forty thousand dollars in credit card debt\nMaybe we can take care of some of that so what's happened is you've had all these folks all this time that's had rape term they got these re term revised so that number on a piece of paper James like yourself at that three and a half percent or whatever you got on your mortgage right\nIt looks amazing you feel good right when you're talking about it on winning it life you're like yeah take that showed you but you know what that number doesn't do that number doesn't help you buy bread milk\nBut for the for the kids and for the family\nAnd what people are what people are understanding as these freight start to go up\nWhen I hear so many of these stories of folks now Gregory you just see looted wanted a top things people call me on is they took out a ... put the kids through college okay or the kids have student loans and the parents are coming and going I Want to be able to help because\nThose student loans when they ... into ... or they were sitting at zero percent\nOr not moving up did not matter now these folks\nOkay they were to go to school come out you get your degree you're gonna make five hundred thousand bucks okay and you know what that's what we'll waive all your student loan sounded great right that was that was the last thing that they're able to come to school will wave all your student loans okay which is\nBaloney never going to happen but so especially in at the federal government owns it why would they give that away\nSo what's happening with the student loans now is we're starting to see a lot more delinquency but the reason to re Pfizer up is because of the delinquency you got student loans that are up you've got credit card debt that is just going through the roof right now going through the roof because that\nFour thousand dollar credit card bill that was eighty two dollars now just because of the federal funds rate increase is now a hundred and twenty something bucks so now all of a sudden you've got people who\nAre in my all of a sudden get a live on a budget\nAm I going to you know not going to go to sonic than I Am I going to go to the grocery and start cooking see it takes time and that's why we're seeing is delinquency it takes time for people to see to force through the trees so\nWhat people are finally being able to take advantage of is while they still do have equity keep in mind before the break one of the things I mentioned appreciation is slowing down and we've been warning people about this all year\nWe've been warning people your house it just can't continue to go up\nPart of your disclosure says you sign a service agreement okay and most of it will say it'll have percentages on their ... percent uh like for instance a cross country the farm I I I represent\nNow we we close the loans in our names the reason why we're able to do that is we're able to negotiate better deals with\nUh your ... your case your other banks out there your bank of America's however what'll happen is sometimes on a secondary market there's what's called servicing companies and the reason why we're able to give the clients a better rate than if they go to the brick and mortar is\nThat servicing company looks at and goes hey this is a quality person we want this person\nIt's it from an affordability standpoint for a company or to be able to have a servicing department do the lending do all that that would all have to trickle back to the client and we don't want to do that in all cases sometimes um they do hold loans but for the most part\nThose loans are so now with that being said and here's what I like for folks to understand when they do business with me\nI all the time somebody will call me and say I have a question about this and you know what they call me we get in touch with the lender or the service sir and we help them through that it's not like when you close alone hey we abandon them and I'll see you later that's it you know because the bottom line is we still services but do we\nDo we put that piece of paper in a file cabinet and go All right hey all that uh all the loans are right here no but we're still here to help them with the servicing of the loan so that's a good point in in a lot of people have to understand the day and age of going down to corner\nA to the to the the the savings and loans place\nA lot of that does not happen where those things stay local and one hundred percent of the time when I asked somebody um hey what's what's the most important thing to you\nWhile rate is always up there or you know and saving money\nIf I go to them go hey I could put you with this company at five percent but I can put you with this other company at three and a half percent\nThey always choose three and a half percent I've yet to have somebody go you know what no I like five percent and what you pay more to keep it alone right well listen ... Wells Fargo right they're all over the news\nFor for goofy things their execs did however they're servicing departments pretty good and and that's a company that we do loan so if somebody goes well I don't know if I Want to be ... and I go well wells is a quarter point cheaper you know what All right ...\nYeah yeah so what is wrong with that you know there what bad can happen to you if somebody has your loan ... that's the loans to contract cry cyclone satirist Joe this and get paid\nAnd I think people get a little bit concerned and and rightfully so and I understand they they ate will something changed no your contract is your contract your loan is you're alone when that service or take that on there taking on that loan as is\nAs is correct okay like back in the day they used to take on the low ... some services maybe didn't allow a bi weekly payments or different things like that now everybody's all in the same boat everybody's offering the same stuff right so in reality when you get something from a company saying hey your loans now with me\nLook at it as a positive because somebody chose you somebody said we want that well because they have an option and so when you get that letter in the mail set of looking at a bad go hey All right Joe blow wants to be a way that stamp doesn't really matter if you got the best deal\nBut I I totally agree with that is there any loans that are done that are guaranteed not to be settled or all of them have the disclosure on\nYeah now nowadays pretty much all all all of them are there's a couple of grant programs uh that that we do that if they go through a grant they stay with them a because you know the lenders are like hey that's a specific program to the grant or the bond money I'm so they'll stay with that particular lender\nAnd ... banks have to shift that stuff and we go back to first NBC which was an ugly deal here and causes the government a billion dollars when the bank went under but some of that trying to shore up they sold off loans to make money there as well and of course when they were taken over\nBy the feds guess walk all loans moved to somebody else in that case and just putting that out you know\nThat guy to try that guys don't have FDIC and that that that's ugly I mean we've done\nWith some of those but it's ... it's also to Gregory it's it's almost like hey listen you know do you want the insurance company a handling your mortgage no let them stick to what they do so to servicing company just set up to handle your loan on the back yeah yeah\nAll right we've got a few minutes here it was and we still have to talk about reverse mortgages now let me share it with your Dwayne a little update in the scenario that I've\nNoticed in that these these commercials the longer versions of some of them are like two minutes long like the Tom Selleck won and they've started adding more features and I think I saw a commercial where they mentioned\nThat you can activate a reverse\nMortgage and the unused portion of your line of credit can still\nGame now I he managed to make of that into\nA distinct one sentence and it was really vague but I knew what he was talking about so we're seeing the evolution happening and not just the reverse mortgage market but the way they're advertised what people know about them but they're still a lot of missed out there what what still hit you in the head when people come in with a reverse mortgage questions\nNumber one is always you know I I I Want to own my own home and that is always number one is I don't want the bank to take my home and I think it's important that I explained to every body it is a non\nRecourse loan and you go are cool non recourse great well what does that mean\nWhat a non recourse loan means listeners is ultimately\nYou're giving your property as collateral and that's your pay back for the loan that does not mean that you can't sell the property it basically means that you've said hey if if everything goes to hack and we're on a plane and something happens and and there's no airs or there's no equity laugh\nA non recourse loans being the banks not going to come back and get your home they accepted and agreed that your ... your property is the ultimate collateral for that long so I think people need to understand what that means by non recourse and it means that they're just not going to come knock on your door for that so\nUh does does do I own my own home or I don't want to pay you hold the title\nI explain that to several verse ... this week you hold the title you will sign multiple documents that will say if you need to pay the place if you want to update the place there's a whole section on it that you will sign that says hey you're responsible you don't need anybody's permission for it\nSo that it that is one the other thing is do I have to pay taxes on any of the proceeds I get absolutely not now here's my ... find proceeds so so any cash that you get it's not considered income\nAny phones that you get from a reverse mortgage off your Social Security and you go get forty thousand dollars well if you went got to forty dollars an hour job that would probably affect your Social Security right but it does it with a reverse mortgage\nOkay now I Would advise you again hey if you're working with Gregory get what's your financial advisor find out hey how's it going to work how can we take advantage of this winter out benefits but you're proceeds the money that you get from a reverse mortgage is not taxable\nOkay I Want to make sure that is explained\nThe other thing people axis woken I control my phone's yes it's your money if you're getting a a a if you're not getting a if you're getting at and will\nReverse mortgage which means you're going to have a line of credit you can do whatever you want with those funds if you're getting a fixed reverse mortgage all that means is you could do whatever you want with those monies you're just going to get one lump sum\nSo James to allude to what I call a magnum PI when I meet with people because it's fun or has all the young folks magnum PI enough on dry you see Henry Winkler on there so so what people would I Want folks to understand is\nPeople are starting to talk about we've been talking about it for years on here right is how much money they make on these lines of credit this week at a client

cold ...

W O R K yes and\nI mean I've recommended that probably for more than a dozen years now when it comes up and he basically said yeah I ... and I I don't know it may cost Nineteen\nDollars back ... and then went to twenty nine might cost thirty my idol mode but when you do a lot of money whether it's ten thousand thirty or more than a hundred thousand you won't get from under it that's meant a skill compared to all those ...\nCharges coast they're expensive and you can't seem to get away from it so he said in his strategy that he went with he started paying off the\nHighest interest straight and then the money would shift to the other cards until it was gone so when you plug that in it actually gives you an end date of when\nIt will be paid off and and you could add more money to the plan but you just keeps shifting when you pay you want all that money shift to the next and he followed it and he said actually in fact he paid it off a had a schedule COSI then added money\nTo it as well because he was it became was like just like oh I've got to do so when when you you get committed to it dedicated the mindset it's it's actually an awesome thing to knock that out in the magic and the [noise] instead of the war\nAnd the pressure and and that extra bills you're paying so that was pretty cool discussion to have\nWell if it helps them any that sort of inspiring to me because what what is my New Year's resolution for twenty Eighteen pay off my credit cards and I'm not even halfway to where I wanted to be at this point has money expected expenses came up they are paid down\nThe man if hearing about this do paying off a hundred thousand dollars worth of credit cards and I can't pay down nine thousand dollars worth of credit cards\nI Need to buck up I Need I Need to get on a game a little bit if it's not going to happen this year I'm just got to try harder next year but if this guy can deal with that kind of gives me hope\nYeah and it's it's something you need to do you need to get that\nDown to where ultimately what's the best way to handle credit cards to pay them off\nAt the end of each month now you're not a guy who is use credit cards in total you actually have credit cards and use them but you have a system\nYeah I pay all the credit card each month now have I have some a little bit of revolving ... bought something for the gym at home and uh one of those trainer\nMachine cross train or what the electrical thing and they are the lip tickle your device yeah and it's a torture device Fifteen minutes of misery every morning you know that kind of thing but it was zero percent for twelve months or something like that I've said I\nCan do that at any mechanics at it that and then you just\nPlug it in an odd because of what you can do bill paying all you can just automate that and it's boom but the whole thing is I could just writer I don't know it was less than a grand I write a check at any point and pay that off but sometimes you like to have free\nFree money so that's the only case because the majority of what I Do and we do run expanses and such a personal side and the business side through that and their whatever it is is paid off each month so you also got to manage doing that\nBecause you don't want to say wow it doesn't matter all chart because I pay it off what what if you do too much\nWith\nYour goal to pay it off you you still have to manage what you're doing so that it does it keep on going and\nBecome re occurring you know we were in a\nMeeting the other day [noise]\nI'm up in Jackson, Mississippi\nAnd ... one of the questions came up about the start taints check", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "27"}
