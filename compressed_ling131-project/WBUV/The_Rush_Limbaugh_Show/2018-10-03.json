I\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is or they don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine ball the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joys of course I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes and Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenger because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat did not been politically useful but in a in a normal to the rational hearing committee hearing\nHer allegations would be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the differences the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only ... Republican senators should have done that last week but they put\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand step by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing\nAnd when he goes off script he doesn't step and it it might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this\nOne year the New York times has been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's\nTax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that\nSaid I'm Talking about everybody and MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did was make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else\nActually or whatever some companies are seeing mostly all around the house\nA bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people this audience it don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what's going to do when you gotta do to create a bike like what you're going to come up with what you're gonna you're gonna come up by women like New Hampshire I\nRead it but it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they don't want him to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're\nOne of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday and she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy\nWait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protester\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protest you know there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this very young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went\nInto early interviews I found out that not at all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me longer than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only

been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators her\nI'm line should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed in her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they\nPlayed ride along and without had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant by the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristie and balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing Trump\nWoman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility leaving later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it\nGives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to\nThe right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you\nThink's really thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nHe just simply probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of\nAnything and it's gospel and then be joined by a so\nCalled movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRush or a million women or nor do there should we do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his wife ... could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n[noise]\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's

been wanting one for nine WVU the heart radio station [noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh but yeah I mean I work for your ear is the there's the dreams of the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIs one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter or to take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate [noise] I'd say\n... ... in in many not that Pacific way but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is uh\nAs founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black kinds of it is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in honor of fairness in bias and discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never that rage and the angered never ends it only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not now Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... for ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the pros we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old I'm ... I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back\nYet to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTalk and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine hook up at a ride by the way here's this you're also random it's not all\nWomen but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into\nThis movement against their will\nIt's just that assumption that the Democrats or the drive by media or making I think every measure young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get capital to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cable on this and there hasn't\nIt's been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the\nPlace now saying well you know there's just many

continue to like and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not get may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why\nThe sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text chart there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid\nEighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid\nEighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance her testimony\nReveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes in her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer
