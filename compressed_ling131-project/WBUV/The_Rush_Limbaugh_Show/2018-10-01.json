is\nDevastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that\nNone of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the testimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly\nAnd yet here she is vacationing all over the world how did you get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to come and he was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last\n\nShe's

sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent of Republicans\nWho are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both were believable if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\n\nOnce the borders are told that the named

of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from

even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the the the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in

activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that\nAt the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women\nTo courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness and sensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened before and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing I'm not saying women coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they are\nBelieve me [laughter] talk [laughter]\nGo

need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we have a one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression poles or polls there aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise]\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now the sevens investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not gonna vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing it is a lot of ... Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks ago two weeks ago so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking everybody talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move\nOn it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read\nThey're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nNot going to limit on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\nUh

followed the Senate leader question what they want it and then he will keep an open mind on the results\nI'm not concerned you know you know what I'm concerned that we get great great people on the U.S Supreme Court that's what I'm concerned that I Want to have great people and I don't want to have to call people for any court\nHave them say surge such a great honor but\nNo thank you I just

has\nBut somebody besides it needs to make the point that this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or\nWhen whatever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for this has got to be stopped\nYou see
