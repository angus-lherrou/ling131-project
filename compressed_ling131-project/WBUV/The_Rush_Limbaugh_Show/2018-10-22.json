children and parents attempt to make their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump resumed tweeting about the ... caravan asserting that criminals an unknown middle Easterners or amid the crowd for which he offered no evidence he also said Democrats are to blame for not working with his administration on immigration reform\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may hit ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be it'd be mental treated abuse what a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nAnd that may yet happened down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war\nAt this stage in the uh\nIn his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet everybody\nWants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do with anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze all what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people\nWho all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I\nMean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how\nMany miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become\nTen thousand [noise]

motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my ego claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the day\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it rains mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration now right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world is so damn hard\nTo understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't\nLived long enough to know what's best for being driven stolen by a motion govern stolen by a motion\nNot any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nFind out how you can win five hundred bucks in a drink or big Halloween photo contest and you talk to ... dot com boom [noise]\n\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border\nAnd make sure nobody forces their way into\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you know you you you know\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist think always trying to get in\n\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family is all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized is the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob uh seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in a\nWhole lot of different ways\nWe'll be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nLike to get lost boys\nTo wash 'em by be Mitt work\nVoters have a choice on election

people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would\nPut the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of\nRallies these

just watching all this go by but this guy's making\nSpectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such A M the weight loss of loyalty and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decent seat which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side of whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThat's the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven\nThousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico mad walk out who they are those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside the lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nGeorgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well that's great have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the gory interesting although we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife well my I let it\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough to okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nAnd we have a variety of different things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we we just have to fold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is let me just put\nWords in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that's the power you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation it'd be ... you'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you'd see a lot of people fall in line it probably would Bush which or I'm Talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit them with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the\nMilitary just in and and and\nIt essentially stormed the bullet storm that guns do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by it's half of their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in no no\nAfter ... and like I say if somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the political legalized now let's see it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nOwn okay right so the ...\nSponsors ability for what happened to them has to be on that you'd think the media is going to allow the apps that this is um I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh speaking on radio\nAgain you're listening to the ER network\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there who\nAdvised the home advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews them from check their bail ability even book appointments online and what my wife I Love most is that home advisor is completely three to you\nGo to ... dot com or download them ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well our investment advice is about it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life feeling secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a point\nWe believe in\nThe bathroom investment advice starts with your people financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people make with some company incorporated member S.

rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and the irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nUp this this this guy Gillum for those of you\nBut living in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the winning Obama like way a would be the first African American governor uh is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about even just talking about Florida as a collective you don't that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy because of what he will do in racking\nA growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally as important this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news with being Zach worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but\nThe Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with\nTrump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where\nThe president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supportive because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped\nBy like this\nThis mob the seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat and you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful\nAmerican needs to be punished whatever else is going on is still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually\nWant government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't
