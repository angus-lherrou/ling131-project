{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "And maybe I'm a fool and maybe this will never happen again but what if the market went down\nWhen you're taking money out what do you think what happened to that retirement income would diminish well you'd be a ... be a point now you'll be fine the first five or ten years been on this especially if you had a couple of million dollars ... unless the market really went down let's say the market went from a point where your two million turned into one million and now you're retiring tomorrow\nWill now you were going to take a hundred thousand a year and be fine now you take fifty thousand out of your story that's all I have to change their lifestyle change and the saddest part to me and this happened back in the year two thousand also saw it happen a tooth of two thousand seven two thousand eight\nIs people that were ready to retire\nHad all their money exposed to the market and either couldn't retire or retired into a lot lesser of a situation as far as income than they ever thought they were going to be in a while but they could have prevented that we call preventive maintenance into financial by taking some money not a lot of money they wouldn't need a lot of money but taking some money out of that that that account was exposed a risk\nAnd put it in a place that had growth that future income and have protection\nAnd now regardless of what happened to the stock market money they had already purchased their income that to be fine with for the rest of retirement love it and therefore they gave him time to get the money that was exposed to risk that went down\nTo not have to touch it so it could come back up well a lot of overlooked in financial planning well because it does most planners tell you to a a ... give me your money and I'll do better for you know all over here and don't worry says the paper last well it's a real loss when people were and I've seen people emotionally their their whole attitude towards life changes a hundred and eighty degrees when the market's going down\nThere you go well I mean you say it's a pay their loss but then he tried to take that money and go buy a vehicle with it I don't I don't think the dealerships gonna let you give a paper last money [laughter]\nI Know so stage one and when we talk about retirement income planning is ongoing it's always building and always think about what's your retirement is going to be and and looking at your tax planning looking at how much money you're going to take out and what what it's going to be taxable what the taxes could be\nAnd looking at what your Social Security when you when you take that and it stays to is well before retirement six to ten years out we start to tame down our risk or\nWe take some of the money out of the risk and we buy the income now that we want for the rest of our lives that will start when we need it like six or ten years down the road offshore and then we don't worry what happens in the market as much anymore [laughter] we always worry right when I was born in ... and it didn't hurt it doesn't hurt to have to worry about safety hey at an sending being proactive\nAnd knowing that things could go the wrong way\nAnd knowing that if it does you've already got your income secured\nAnd so you're not going to be very emotional when it comes to the money that still exposed to risk there you go to Amy down there isn't getting managed managed risk and doing that strategic look at your money making sure that you do the calculated risk exposure level on the money that's at risk so based on their risk you're taking how much could you lose the market with the wrong way and\nThen how much income to need so let's take some of that money out of the risk account let's get an income plan that will build our money where our money give us income that we know what the income will be at a certain age and our life for the rest of our life and the rest of our spouse's life knowing that if we pass away too soon that money will go on to our next the kids who don't lose\nYou can't lose the money yeah sure it's either there for us or is there for somebody else and back in the old days if you if you got a personal pension like that and you passed away the money was gone\nSo [laughter] but now the the world has changed for the better for us if you get with a fiduciary plan or they'll put together a plan that makes sense to you that will give you that lifetime income it'll give you the growth of the market on one side it'll give you the income on the other side it's income planning and it's ... it's what changes every a financial plan into\nA retirement plan it Cinderella is carriage that never turns into a punk and think about that there you go yeah you know that I think about twelve o'clock at night having to do a book and yeah and that will never turned above and if you do it right so you never worried about having to get home to see the uh step mom and get\nThere you got what we always you know we always hope for the best and I was talking to you or the other day in the hallway about this coach uh about uh we were putting some video content together I think for one of the videos that we do on financial ... dot com\nAnd I saw a video clip it was from a news outlet and it was done and I think Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand and it was showing the projections of the stock market for the next Twenty years if you don't know that oh eight is going to happen you don't know the oh and\nOne is when the rejections for me [laughter] just like Hillary is projected to win the last year [laughter]\nBut let me ask you this do you think a lot of people 'cause you obviously meet with folks on a daily basis you and the team upstairs right do you find that most people have these optimistic projections and that when you actually run the numbers and they see what actually could happen there is a little bit of a blinds open\nYeah and one of the parts is and that's just one of the faces of retirement planning is looking at what you're going to have yeah the other phases especially when we get like a one year away from retirement especially we need to look at what our expenses are going to being retired OK yeah and so we make sure that our income is going to exceed\nOr outcome or I'll go ... [laughter] as we want more money coming in for me talking about before when\nWhen you have a true income plans set up inside your financial plan it turns into retirement plan but an income plan is when the mailman brings you money each year he puts that green flag on the mailbox\nAnd you walk out every every couple of weeks and put red flags on to send your bills out [laughter] so you want you want a bigger green flag yeah than all the red flags that are together and therefore you have more income than than money going out and that's a successful retirement that's one that you have\nA peace of mind and you don't have ... and you're not worried about turned the TV running home to turn the TV ought to see if your retirement accounts still there because of what happened markets I\nBelieve it or not I know we laugh about it but\nBut I Know a lot of people listening or looking at each other right now saying do we really have\nA retirement plan yeah yeah coach Pete of course we establish why I'm coach Pete original post says that if if financial plan is only a financial plan until you have income built into it now is a true retirement plan and that income has to have to have growth\nIt has to have protection and it has to have income guarantees for the rest of your life that is a true\nIncome plan it's none of these phony baloney plastic banana kind of reached that we hear about silver and gold all these fly by night promissory notes all these get rich quick schemes it's a real regulated retirement plan there you go and most people don't have that Thomas I think everybody out there needs to review\nThere's three things that happened when we do a review\nNumber one we tell you you're doing great everything's fine I Would not change a thing when the great to get that sample of approvals right yes or it's hey you just need a couple of weeks but you can get right back on the track\nMaybe you're on that train track and and you took the wrong turn and now you just have to reverse a little bit and get back on the real trick a bad thing or number three either don't have a plan or the plan or you have that\nHas been misleading you thinking to did ... and then we can do a total rebuild redesign for you in three steps we do twenty two steps behind the scenes it's called our total retirement plan\nIt's a nine hundred and Ninety nine dollar value\nProbably more than that when you look at all the man hours but we've only price at nine Ninety nine you can buy off the shelf if you want or you can come in as a radio listener we waive our fee\nIt includes a box set a called a seven financial blind spots where I'm even going to throw in another box that called the four one K. survival box that 'cause most people listening have for one case is also apple bill to for three bees and three savings plans if there was dressed in there as well\nThomas and I put together a brand new video a couple of months ago called the video on retirement it'll be in there too and I'll give you a three books set of written eight books\nI think my three most popular ones are have you been talking to financial aliens it's your practical guide to translate your financial situation to prevent your situation of being ... by shrink race I Love it so I was just a fantastic offer were given were given the formerly here has probably got a two thousand dollar value when we throw it out and really is so but still I'm going to keep it\nSimple as long as you have two hundred thousand dollars safe retirement I'm going to make this offer for you would never do this we never it's usually three or four hundred thousand yeah offer but our strategies do work as we do have a private wealth division if you have over a million dollars would give even some more strategies for to make sure that that money you have is in the proper places too\nSo for the next ten cars this offers for you call right now I'm sure the phone lines are going to heat up\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assess your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path this limited but complementary review will help\nHow prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement that falls we talk about on the show those include inflation Social Security healthcare emergency so many things stock market volatility risk taxation but here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime\nRetirement income planned or his right folks an income plan to last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account\nNow the number to call in and meet with poll Roberts who is ... ... local trusted financial coach in the ...\nThe area is eight hundred eight nine one\nEight six eight\nZero when you call and you will receive a comprehensive retirement review that will show you where you are now but much more important it'll show you a roadmap to get you where you need to be folks\nThere really is nothing to lose call on in and take advantage of that number once\nAgain eight hundred eight nine one eighty six eighty again that eight hundred\nEight nine one eight six eight\nZero books will join your next week right here on the financial support [noise]\n\nCoach the information but it was written works was only two investment tax where we would find information to bring that are going to be a reliable when we're really we've been hearing or marriage even Rudolf ...\nRiver Mission District would Wal Mart\nGuarantees are always wanting to strengthen claims paying ability recovery for early receiving offering more specific details\nNo company wants to withdraw diverted that when you\nMarry economy you're there\nFrom the mantle GMC studios he's talked for nine point and I\nHate treads will not have a place anywhere I'm Pam who sells Fox News the words of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill to do though as his city mourns the loss of a lead in people who were shot and killed while worshipping at a synagogue\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may owe him even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show gave not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network infant didn't want to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let the men\n\nAs elected still their ... year about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic\nGamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what did you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right word but they wouldn't be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking\nWe we've got how many two thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance to Arizona\nAccording to police the ... forty six year old Robert

Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned of these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised\nThe stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my goal claiming they were inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nDeployed out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who won that right mind would promote this one wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about\nThis I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nEnough to know what's best for being driven solely by a motion govern\nYou buy a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a masked a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun and this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nCountry that's just you know the representative John Ratcliffe on Fox News Sunday Morning futures this is Fox News [noise]\nStock sopping whether\n... percent less work Everytime hats on Saturday live the Gulf Coast information you talk going on for nine telling you ... [noise]\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise]\nCNN playing an impartial ... by the media to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked up\nAbout that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it a into a course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOr we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this is it in ... what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian\nCommunist thank God is trying to get in an invasion\nEither way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly and so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is in a\nWhole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we

us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake out who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does that I think because it's still works at sea so Trump traumas he's pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you\nAre which takes me to want peace\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at\nYale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L\nL C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\n\nAnd let me give you a simple quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased prince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations that Kavanaugh fight will stand\nAs a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to ... and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole cabinet episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying an American life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... the only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what he had hates about America\nAnd hate America it does folks not that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at ...\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectual\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are interchangeable\nAnd worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity Democrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical and claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people are just not right and everybody has to you you do some way to you know nobody can be that\nKind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love it quick vacation they love people see both sides to things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certainty especially when the conflict with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy white swimming\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America\nI'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained the average American that Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad in other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents\nWorry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nThey love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nLeftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike such

everybody holding on we're going to start in a buys Ohio David Europe first at heart\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening\nTo NPR and Steve as a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I'll take my lunch break and they have another NPR a\nPersonality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to seem all they want to say it's only a few thousand people what's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThat there's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh and the ... the great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whatever means for them and that meant it they can\n[noise] that you get for we've got a bad we got a a a a bad connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and and that happens while I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three week\nUh but but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and the ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day assigning believe and they\nJust they just they just they just because they're human beings just it just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are budget and mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now when we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know as obese grew with Trump Trump's Hitler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed and is being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose\nTo flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge way most Ramos or whatever\nIt is it what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it your ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to\n[noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm there behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's now ... for him\nHe's telling everybody who they are and what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want\nLife and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all have these\nVarious humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats pool asked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal the Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration with a vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian of Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is\nTalking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a mob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense it may as well because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourselves\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is gonna be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has the gods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as a reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has it worked that you can it's if it's getting back to the same old thing\nThey can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just sit\nTo be tied over it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win

website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics that was among many other things is average all of the so called response to the polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox business\nNetwork today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd\nBe seeing the top of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no\nCrafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he\nSays and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning\nThe Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half to two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise] so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they

announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations\nStadium tour they're gonna charge admission\nFor people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a whole lot of interest in [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet buying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clintons art anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft troubling as fully collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left us tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger why not say that this is just to past it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is [noise] uh we'll see we'll let time on fall\nHere in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia a then within that there was a kid or riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRush you know if you're talking about this passing the smell 'cause I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous\nDreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is already George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to a pain you know there was never any of the country these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain de but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no loans that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to the real\nUh the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked what makes you think that they wouldn't do something to do it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis was going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats I don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh
