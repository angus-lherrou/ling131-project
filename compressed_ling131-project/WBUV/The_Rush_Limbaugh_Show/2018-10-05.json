B. the heart radio station [noise]\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and it's designed this founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration wants to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out to\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant a\nThere would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so what did he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transfer America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nSome of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back looking as a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study\nThat has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this by the facts on the grounds as to what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt your race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which\nHas had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFrom as many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women\nWhatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it just the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding\nNot just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by

Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way to boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's

McLean\nCorrect yeah it was a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... ... ... a Delaware with my client yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet\nI I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nIt's\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote

couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they have not shown up at Yahoo

of a grass away with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin on the floor that\nWas during his US Senate for remarks today in favor capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic\nNational Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth ... I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats\nLike this fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it\nI got an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a note from her last night\nAnd she is\nExplaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nIf senators vote tomorrow how they voted this morning Brett Kavanaugh will be the next Supreme Court justice the Senate invoke cloture limiting the bait by a fifty one forty nine margin that procedural vote advancing the nomination\nPassed with support from Republicans Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin three senators who are considered swing votes on the nomination Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski buck to party leadership voting no and suggest she will oppose final confirmation tomorrow Collins another moderate Republican is expected to announce how she will vote on Kavanaugh later today Lisa\nMeantime Jared both sides painting a bigger picture for the confirmation vote Texas Senator John Cornyn among the Republicans accusing Democrats of character assassination on Kavanaugh\nI actually think by the feeding judge Kavanaugh's nomination we wouldn't be signaling that this is somehow the

votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed\nNothing changes and that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court that could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in

to supposedly\nBe in unison with me too\nMovement [noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were taken

in the ... this was in the middle of the campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's the bread and Aubrey just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is ... co workers seat And Corker by the way has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose an actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that\nAnd then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperament temperament and they weren't going to deny because it committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut
