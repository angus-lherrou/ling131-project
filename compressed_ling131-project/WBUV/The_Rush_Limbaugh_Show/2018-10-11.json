I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences in has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has just started the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's the and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question where Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for Iraq Hussein all\nInvolved in many scandals himself and I'm seeing a lot\nOf people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder was saying what he said you know on the show my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we kept\nThem so people so my God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no\nI didn't mean it literally I was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama met him when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people wouldn't get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators\nThey're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why why are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to one by one day where we can confirm\nThat the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned in the poll indicated the house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house\nIn their minds they almost won the Senate they have the Mueller report and the mullah report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall\nFolks they can scratch their bags with it they just can't aid and all that Mahler secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN engaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing at New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time\nMagazine when was this a two thousand\nFive the drive by media proclaim Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was in the future Kanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy the white truffles funny that Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why did you can Trump said you know what you have a point but there were people that have been\nA lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them\nI had to go and it was a great time Trump to slam dunked him on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House so now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListen black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft don't ...\nAll of a sudden cognac 'cause he's put on a ... hat and he is he's\nAn attention horror like the president needs all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's a token negro the Trump Administration is a ridiculous\nSays the CNN paddle fighters so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence and launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening\nHere they're soft coup failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guys are going to wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of the Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration the soft coup it didn't work\n\nSilent about the skill lease\nShooting should have been a clue\nOf the Democrats depravity

trying to cover up for it anyway you know people are observing out there I got another email rush\nCould you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee\nLet me it's ... and I'll be ... if you I'll be glad to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as your mark a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it and it has to do\nIn many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then the show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealthy which was made to look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach so whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some modest the crown\nPrince in Saudi Arabia his father is the king king sol ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with him a royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nThe United states he spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is winding dying the Google guys is winding dined\nLook guys spend a lotta time an apple he wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garbage he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if\nHe is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women\nHe is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them open up being able to drive a go places on their own without mail at company but this made him quite controversial he also last\nSummer not this past summer last night and it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage\nOf their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do to corruption and connections and storms he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm On\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example ... wanted to get married\nHe had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey in order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in\nIstanbul and hasn't been seen since\nHe went in to get a marriage license he was wearing get this he's wearing an apple watch his I found though was connected all watch was outside in the car with his fiance who was outside waiting on him to get his marriage license to come back out then they go off and live happily ever after\nNow do you think this guy's going to vote for this guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and finding this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi\nRight here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well\nI'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... hey Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that they're ... but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the\nPhones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I so\nI was there I was in the uh for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing in a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both\nThe right loses when were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the for rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't show up\nThat's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough that they could not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nYou say you're in

the last debate between the Trump stir\nEmma heal the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which where pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election columns that we've counted the votes\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for the drugs\nHave you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American yes that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide than my the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat an upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up and said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in gear\nIs the biggest threat to our democracy when you're a member\nThere may be saying there's this is written so then Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be rude during his mind a little bit with Clinton and October the mine tape you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he will concede\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior\nIn in speech writer told the intelligence

congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to try an forestall a political crisis by validating we election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and Congolese are rice\nAnd a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and cons of laser rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this\nRussia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happened no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it if Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero\nShe overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the oligarchy she overcame Russia that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole\nIt and to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this story\nNew York magazine they think they're doing an ad a boy here they think they're really praising Obama they are admitted that
