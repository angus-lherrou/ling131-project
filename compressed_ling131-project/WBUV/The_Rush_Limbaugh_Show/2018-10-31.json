time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away\nFrom the traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan and immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a tea they are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media\nResponsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left ... people\nWho commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that didn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a

have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and

Taiwan Area but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link up the Trump that good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see\nAffecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when their side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms much appreciate it you do you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place\nOut there and uh this was that was pre Trump and the\nBelief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where is the damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that ...\n... ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall\nWith it and it became a standing joke you know that the the best way to make everything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning was born in the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent\nUh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one of ... usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially if it was a brand new planning that\nI don't know whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he says about what will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be limited dom somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo sea salt in it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus if it weren't\nFor Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs it why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations of whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... get the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rates serial rapist where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none for which they were willing to destroy a man\nWhy they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made ... laying eyes terrify do here and so they had to build an excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost one okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy and Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that Kavanaugh's confirmation circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means which there'll be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then\n[noise] Elissa the president comes here tonight to rally support for his political allies in Florida and

their case to the mid term election President Trump will hold eleven rallies\nIn eight states he has again a great contrast between Republicans and Democrats are going to see him lay that out and I think it's going to be a huge difference maker\nEverybody in the world out there disagreeing with it but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nCan show your countless in in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out the window\nIt just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so there are examples even when people are dams certain\nWhat's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day I'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final\nStretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close you can take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and\nTen next paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat\nPickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and on his ... his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get the job or a ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on this\nTrend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... ... to be can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval it fifty three percent so Republican representative quality a penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise]\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up in marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seats but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning however liable aren't on this thing and then the next ...\nAre we relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before 'cause the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story what else is working out\nVery well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this
