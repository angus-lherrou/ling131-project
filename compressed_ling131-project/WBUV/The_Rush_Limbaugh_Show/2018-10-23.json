have all unified behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner it didn't matter\nWhat else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA hand of election this caravan thing you know I [noise]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired\nTotal miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off or going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve\nPart is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic where it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic it is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paying for it it's all focus grouped it's poll tested from their\nPerspective and the the obvious you know there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years\nWe now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with seven\nThousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles into wakes up and walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have\nTo be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real\nFrom the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking from Honduras\nTo the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of left is just that this up and when you look at that and examine that from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is\nThat makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentments\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nFrom fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you\nAnd it's it's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid terms because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control\nOf the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house this is almost identical to five thirty it's forecasting\nTwo weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety\nTwo percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go\nThe cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm elections the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive fundraising\nHaul in the third quarter of this year\n[noise] so those are the two story but then\nIf you turn to NBC News and the wall

eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing Democrat voters in seven of those including North Carolina\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada\nHave Democrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in the early voting the latest data is from NBC\nSuggest robust in a fool's Yaz among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have an advantage when in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nThat

beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant to deceive people\nThose lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if\nYou control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you\nControl them you can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line that the doctor and this is

just remember you just do you remember where it is ... ... for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances have his life depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and like government take care of things\nThis guy was a

about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time you have people yelling at me at Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy can attack

night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can\nMaybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me and everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting

don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going
