blood was black you're black\nOr this was this is a grotesque school her her percentage are so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you're going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection allergy requires qualification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans not meant for conservatives is only about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to [noise]\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept\nThat I find that most people to whom I mentioned to have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's on a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection now to come straight out of Marxism march said that everyone has either on a pressure or oppressed they're either bourgeois or poets heritage\nAt its later is now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nSpread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat on washed you're you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful uh intersection out all the action is basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all ... with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that I'm\nA ... with the with militant Islamic feasts that than with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to\nIndividual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops up some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is again a resurrection of the one drop rule that this person and just so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you've never seen me believe me I'm white\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to some continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections
