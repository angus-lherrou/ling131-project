suit as a super team and even our ... right so you you add three qualities stars with your young talent\nThey play it out of this world and that the next especially in the east that's what a super

right if you're looking at Jason Tatum had a great rookies the rate\nHe was fantastic does it take some of their allotment of all those picks that they still have I'm sure it would take some of them

from fifty five no kick or college or pro has hit from longer than fifty five and the history of that stadium in Pittsburgh so it was impressive pit one in overtime\nForty four thirty seven over

only hard part figuring out which way is easier goodness what is going on with the Iraq you know the hell of a run right through it was great run all the way down to the one yard line for Virginia Tech in book just before then what the hideous interception\nHe has not played well tonight he from no Notre Dame quarterback he must of wide open receiver for an easy touchdown earlier in the game just over shot him terrible interception right here so he's pressing feeling the pressure maybe a little bit on the road\nYou're going to be okay\n[noise] I my mood starting this hour got to be honest with you big man\nDon't let our guard down sour bill in the first have lot of ... that is true lots to go out of ... to go with ebbs and flows in San Diego state game [laughter]\nEmotional game ... by the way I got a question for you here real quickly because Steve the savior mentioned in the update David Price just terrible again in the postseason the guy is to an eight in his postseason careers E. R. A. is over five he's had\nNumerous meltdowns and we certainly know that if you don't have a lot of success beforehand you can feel the pressure even more so right yeah\nBut if you take that and apply it to Florida State kick hers do you think because Florida state's kicker\nThere was a long attempted that he was an even ... mostly close the commentators were joking around when they were like wide left it's actually like W wide left it didn't have a prayer and I'm curious do you think\nThat a current Florida State kicker is aware of the history with Florida in Miami and all these ... kicks from FSU to the point where the current kicker feels that pressure in that game\nNo I don't think so I you know there's this you know when all of that was the evidence was ... or\nYou had to be in his mouth little ones the you know what I mean so I don't think that trend\nIt's I think that you know it it's hard for me to comment on kicker is because I don't know what it takes to be a a kicker yeah right like I don't know what that is like you want to be offered the lime and this is what you got to be number one you got to be massive\nOkay but you get a quick can't get a quick feet and you got to be able to move\nRight long arms hope those type of things and then you've got to train a lot of push a lot of pool strength soldiers to be a kicker mine does it have you back\nA Johnny kick the ball to the trash can you know so I don't know what mentally goals in physically goes into being an accurate kicker I couldn't tell you that right right the kick it off the inside of your foot you kick it with the told you kick you ... like I don't know what that is\nYeah I think it has a lot more to do with the hearing now than the past if you're talking about all of these games where the wide rights for Florida State kicker is against Miami years ago\nI think it's more about today's game instead of taking the field like oh man I might be the next Florida State kicker who miss is a big one\nI don't think it really factors in but in the moment of course you're going to feel that pressure everybody feels the pressure especially on the road that atmosphere in a game that you were up by twenty points Florida State was in fourth and starts is slowly slip away slip away you can feel that pressure no matter who you are\nYeah you are in ... which is not a good year for state this is no [laughter] isn't that what you want okay and you know for the state fan or theory they a lot of ex teammates who are Florida State alum and they are just\nYou know they're a bit much reporters date is winning day or you know we're a bit much now you know the tables turned that rivalry between voters they'd Miami that's deep right down deep into to be your kicker\nWith the history like you were saying in this type of game and not perform\nAt ... good luck you know yeah\nYeah it's [laughter] I I Believe there are games that are confidence makers and confidence breakers you know when you miss a big kick in a game like that\nHow do you make a positive out of it how do you say I'm the man I'm going to make the next ... at something that can absolutely break you down especially when you're a young kid like that you know right that's rough it's rough but a man that's the game that the position that comes with the territory I coming up next the guy goes studios\nTakes my arm from my body with the torn labor minute and begins to pitch\nI don't know what it is worries like alright seven thinning everything that was working who's normal change it on the fly but you don't want something different\nTry something else [laughter] ... yeah\nHe checked his here's what Clinton was saying in terms of not having something to prove\nI don't really need to prove myself anybody I Want my them as for me out there I think that's the biggest thing you know ... inside of encourage season and his pitch really well for us and looking forward to watching the night and uh I'll get my turn them all\nI think this way from you always have something to prove whether you've had good and bad performances\nClayton Kirsch always had in the postseason he certainly has it been the same caliber of pitcher not even close ... close my name is bill like this\nIf he pitched the way he pitched in the\nPostseason like he did in the regular season if he did that we wouldn't be talking about it\nOh gosh but even if Clinton cursed shah was the same guy in the postseason that we see just before heading baseball in the regular season\nI still would disagree with them you still have something to prove always it's not about what you've done it's about this postseason it's about a year and now I hate when I hear athletes say I don't have anything to prove you always do I don't know why anyone would have that mentality\nYeah eat anytime you step out there you have to prove them yeah you don't ... ah I'm Tom Brady has something to prove\nIt drew in ... and they they go right to rate like Drew Brees we're talking about him he wants to have an eighty percent completion percentage this year he he's not satisfied somebody's got five rings you see I'm going through the motions no not at all I Know that's like\nYou know Peyton Manning thing during his run when he got to the playoffs I don't have anything to prove\nOh yeah yeah you do have that you only do we've got to check this out you from this is Peyton Manning this is when the colds and Peyton worth ... breaking up remember they had the pressure on friday out when they were releasing him losing his back and forth with painting and a reporter\n[noise] [laughter]\nNo I don't throw it out in the name of fruit for a while I was playing fight for more than a\nStill store or\nAt\nYou always have something to prove I Love

Segre misspoke and I'll never make that mistake again on us that when he said it product far I'm like oh it's a forty three yard or you must have meant upright nope you might cross bar and it wasn't the flack did it wasn't anything he just came up short of forty three order\n... that'll do it come on man welcome\nTo the world [noise]\nOf\nKicker led down do you vote yes or no on the phrase he shooter leg yes you go yes I go yeah All right we'll put that into a room put that into the rotation over the show because that's the sound\nOf the ball coming off your foot sure when this just doesn't have enough mustard on it\nYeah that's a that's an ugly sound it's kinda like the ... sound you know what you are not happening on Wednesday they will be a lot of ... ... ... that is such an\nUgly sound man especially when you think you just drained a three pointer and it's just the back of the iron just from\nHorrible horrible a Texas day and um they just one rush up the middle by a tray beyond Williams ... Kentucky falls from the ranks of the young beaten ...\n... there'll be ranked twenty fourth now [laughter] you know it stinks for them is they totally get host because of the past yeah\nReally it is it's Kentucky's done nothing in terms of football so it's a tough loss at Texas saying them but a and M. was favored by six points they went right on to the spread depending on when you got it you know so they did what Vegas\nWas essentially putting in the ballpark of them doing but you're right Kentucky they are going to be like oh we never should've bought in on rank\n[laughter] exactly that's exactly what the [laughter] ...\nYeah okay So Richard Sherman he's shared some opinions throughout the years writing from here and there have you ... a little bit so he had some things to say about these new NFL rules check it out\nYou can't touch 'em you can't ...\nYou you can knock them down to the ground hard if you're pushing through ... you know all the better you can hit a receiver high and low you can't push 'em you can't you can barely prep him you know if it was very very difficult on teams to to combat it because every ruling in the book was inspired to make sure you don't get himself\nYeah man it's rough it is rough to play defense it's not impossible but everything explained is true and\nThe quarterback the right way where you're not falling on top of them that is it's really tough to do and I'm sure you saw this during the week you from\nThe Los Angeles rams they were practicing hitting a dummy tackling it as if it was a quarterback\nAnd there was one funny thing ... just went up to it just punched it [laughter] just what it but the other times they were doing it they were hitting and they were wasting as they were wrapping and falling to the ground and that's the next aspect of this\nOr I understand they're trying to keep the quarterbacks healthy\nAnd it gives them a better chance of defensive linemen are not falling on top of them I think that puts the lemon and a bad place at times\nBut you're going to see them twist so they don't land on top of them and if a quarterback has his foot planted firmly in the ground in a big defensive lineman is twisting while eating out you can see where this is going to end up\nYeah then it's literally going to be a game of tag if you can tag the quarterback the ball is\nDid that's headed and tag you think we'll ever see that in the NFL\nThink about like legitimately quarterback was the only position on the entire\nTeam that doesn't receive any contact\nOther than in the game that it quarterbacks only receive\nContact in games mhm\nNo one ever touches the quarterback and practice training camp oh tia anything\nSo now they're making it\nTo where you can barely touched them in the actual game\nMhm I mean I understand safety but the message that it's sending this guy can't be touched\nYou can't touch the quarterback if you push the quarterback down after he throws the ball it's a penalty if you land on the quarterback no matter what happened to you to force you to land on them it's a penalty if you I saw a play\nUm if you jump up and that and the Thursday night game ripping the passer\nMhm a linebacker blitz running back cut him he was in the air his hands were\nUp ... gets cut slips forward hits a\nCousins right no no he hits I'm God or the Brady oh and I thought I was ... when I started writing I always go with last Thursday night this ... yeah and my helmet\nNot that he was trying to put his hands were up to block the bed he gets cut it puts forward rubbing the passer I was like [laughter]\nAll right there you have it why do you think this is where we're going yeah\nThat's where it's progressing towards um I Want you to listen to this this is Eli Manning and take it for what we're talking about listen to what Eli Manning is talking about in terms of forcing the ball down field\nRisk is not what you want to take because even though the ball down the field where there's not risky and then there's force and things and that leads to peel turnovers that leaves the mistakes and I'm not like you know having shots down the field that are not taking it just a matter of you know kind of way and\nBy the way you from the lovely Christine and I went to the ... last night oh how was it I Can't wait\nFor a very good she loved it she thought it was great I thought it was very good absolutely worth seeing highly recommend it great performances by Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga tons of music in the movie so yeah and I'm telling you man leave value originally says insane\nNo yeah so I was a fan of the original anyway so I I couldn't wait I Can't wait to see it\nYeah yeah and Dave Chappelle head a little bit yeah I was in a cameo yep he did a good job as well yeah it's cool good movie thumbs up Lee Robert lap before\nHe is our resident movie critic he is a huge movie guy he's typically very positive except when it comes to Clint Eastwood directed movies [laughter] certainly outbreaks down hey he's got some uh so you've got some gems in their unforgiving the a million dollar baby but I'm not\nThe biggest fan of the grand jury knows and the dream Americans neighbors in\nAnd other things but I'm looking forward to you I think that looks like a great film it does look very good have you seen the previews for that ... yeah yeah ... that looks good what did you say I couldn't hear you in terms of Gran Torino yay or nay\nNo no no American Sniper was okay we're going to say All right great yeah we'll get a million dollars a day was excellent yeah oh that was fantastic movie yeah\nBy the way before we do a rapid fire week five preview\nWe were doing and I should of written it down we were gassing when levy on bail would end his hold out and there was word that he might end the whole doubt by reporting around week seven which is the by week does that make any sense you know why why would he do that\nThat makes no sense\nWe pin I'll see you I Believe has its uh when they could uh trade 'em right that's the the deadline for trading is weeks since the dawn is me he's forcing his way back to maybe\nI don't think that that is that the deadline I don't think so it's right around the trade\nThat I think the week nine is the trade deadline I Believe\nWe have I don't know off the top of my head but it's around that time and that's the thought is maybe levy on bell is saying hey I'll be back guys and that gets the ball rolling with the trade because there's a lot of stuff to work through if levy and just had the backing\nGoes into the locker room at the Steelers with them counting is money in the back and forth so they might say let's just get something for the guy well we can't I think they should work through those issues it's obvious they need that guy back big ban has been exposed so far this year you know to six in the backfield\nHere in even do a damn Khan has done a ... job and replacing him there was nothing like one of the best and most dynamic runners in ... when you don't have that guy there is a difference you can tell the difference\nYeah All right so let's go rapid fiery from how 'bout speaking of the Steelers hosting the falcons [laughter] you\nGotta win this game if you're either team you can't be stuck on one when after week five [noise] how do you see that game going down I'm\nLooking at the Steelers to pull that game out yeah fellow defenses so bank but I was really\nBad and you know on the road I'm going with the Steelers the total is fifty eight [noise] can you take the under [laughter] a voice in that game and yeah it will be a lot of points of view that lack of defense on both sides so [noise] you know [noise]\nI'm looking at the rams I have no problem laying the seven and a half their strength\nTheir defensive line is the Seahawks weakness the Seahawks defensive line I think it's a mismatch and it's the first game without Earl Thomas you telling me Sean McVeigh can exploit a few holes and it's going to be a nasty\nOne I think I agree with that as well [noise] yeah ...

I started\nYet why he if he of course lives there is the Oklahoma sideline reporter I ah I've been to a couple of them having that was ... and um I got to tell you it's an absolute blast I mean you're going to the Texas state fair you got the game going on\nI've never been to a game words split right down the middle I mean it is absolutely intense and you know it's one of those old cliches you throw away the record um it's\nIt's one of those great traditions you know I hate to go ahead and and be one of those guys I'm Wondering how much better this tradition would be or this driver would be\nIf we had a home and home series instead of\nPlaying it right down the middle and I know it's about the same mileage\nFrom Austin a I Believe the dollars as it is for ... hours but how great would it be if we at home field advantage in a gay might this\nI kinda disagree oh come on I mean I think it's one of the cool things look there are ... there are a lot of great home and home rivalries and college football the ones I mentioned Auburn, Alabama Ohio State Michigan\nBut I think it's pretty cool it and listen you're the the expert that's been all these games but uh I mean you know I'm told that the scene outside with the state fair going on is an unbelievable dating yeah yeah so why don't we just keep it\nThe way it is because that that that's what that's what college football's about though that whole field what else do you know what college football's about what tradition and this is an unbelievable tradition you know and you know maybe it's kind of like 'cause I've I've also been to the uh Florida Georgia game\nAnd I I prefer that would also be a home field advantage to be honest with you I don't I'm not too crazy about these new neutral site games I don't know what were the Texas and the Oklahoma fans feel about that and you can send us a tweet Aaron underscore tour as I'm add stinking genius one\nBut I think the fans of those teams would love to have it on their on their home campus that'd be just enjoy that\nYeah I mean I think it depends I mean it's just one game it's another game or maybe a people in that town in the city maybe can't afford to go because we know some of these are these good seats in these big stadiums he's I kept stadiums are owned by the big donors\nA plus you know there's plenty of people in Dallas that aren't that close to Austin that are that close to the norm and it's a chance to go go there it's a chance to make a weekend out of it go to the state fair\nI'm I have no problem with it and I think too it sets up for you know an interesting scenario as far as just what a winning loss means going forward as far as if that games at Oklahoma is there may be a different\nResult today and then if there is now all of sudden Oklahoma there in a position where they maybe have probably have to win out to be in the mix for the playoff conversation\nI'm sure we'll get into kind of where Oklahoma is later on the show I like it

agree with you as I I think that this is Nick Nick Saban his team is so much better than everybody else I mean here's the thing about Alabama they have always been so phenomenal on the defensive side of the ball not today obviously but in general\nNow they have the number one scoring offense in college but right now and I you know ask\nYou a quarterback that they know no disrespect to Joe it hurts for the quarterback that's put of astronomical numbers\nOh absolutely I mean to us today\nTen of third team over three hundred yards and for touchdowns three under thirty he average thirty three yards per completion jeeze forty percent of his past is one for touchdowns today so the point is is that I Do think Nick's David is looking for ways to motivate his team I think\nI don't know if it will be until that as you see championship game but I think he feels like look at some point we're going to be challenged maybe it's LSU\nI guess in theory maybe it could be all burnt although Auburn did not look good tonight they lost again\nAnd so whatever whoever that opponent is Nick Saban needs his team ready and I don't think he wants it to try to click in a place a week or two before that game where the ... the week of the Georgia game I think he wants his guys focused right now and needs them focused\nBecause eventually they're going to run into somebody that can at least give them

hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well that's bigger out which way is easier you know you just said that if there's a faster way to get the eight teams\nThat's the way to do it um you know when you're getting two teams from one conference\nBut doesn't see there's such a disparity in you know are such a gap between number one and then two three and four\nDo we really what eight teams when we think five through eight really is not even close to the same part of victims five six seven and eight would all be double digit other dogs to Alabama\nWell I'll tell you this Arnie first of all I'm One of those guys and I don't know where you stand on it I don't really have a problem with the four team playoff like I think it's good the way that it is and and I understand we always want more we always feel like we need more but I think it's the the reason that I'm okay with poor instead of eight is because of what you said\nEverybody says well if you're a conference champion you deserve to be in\nWell their teams that played for these conference championships because the conference and the divisions are imbalance their teams playing for conference championships with three four five losses I mean you see a few years ago played for the pack twelve title was for losses is that a team that deserves to automatically get in\nUm so to me I've never had a problem with sticking with\nFor a while you have no problem in college basketball though when teams or some five hundred or five hundred that get into the NC double a tournament\nWhat the conference champions ... yeah the coverage jeopardy from these small conferences or that tradition well\nThis is all the everything strip isn't to you this is tradition what do you\nLike first of all but yeah of course if if the NCAA tournament if they wanted to expand to a hundred teams and lead in you know the ninth place team from the packed off although they actually did that last year and right right\nBut if they want to let in tenth placed team from the pact well and the thirteenth placed team from the ACC I'd be don't I'd say don't be ridiculous\nAnd so to me I just don't like this idea I don't know if someone\nYou have a problem with expanding eight I have a bigger problem with automatic conference champions in the case of football I see that's all say every situation that I I I\nHave no problem going with the top five ... will go with the five majors and then maybe like three at large and and work at that way but I'm I'm certainly one that was expanded from Fort a just a couple of the scores you mentioned Georgia you know this was not as easy as it looks like on the school board forty one Thirteen if you didn't see the game\nAnd easily miss because there was so many other great games today or this was seven to three at the end of the first than a Twenty one of the six I Know sounds like it's well in hand but that's the scored after I've been there for about a couple of drives where they could have put touches on the board\nUm obviously they're they're often folders it gives a great Georgia defense but I just wanted to say was that much of a route like like people were expecting\nWell say this for Georgia they got a big game next week against LSU on the road that's the one I think that well first of all the look at the back in uh Georgia schedule depending on how you feel about a couple of these teams yeah they play at LSU\nThen they get a by then they play Florida in Jacksonville where America wants to keep that game or a Spaniard don't dare don't you dare try to make it home and home\nAnd then they play Kentucky I mean those are three teams that are All right now ranked in the top twenty five Florida is obviously going to jump up after that LSU win\nBut I can forgive Georgia if maybe there are looking ahead a little bit to LSU because those you came into the day undefeated ranked in the top five they obviously did lose but I Wonder if Georgia was maybe just looking ahead a little bit\nAlso Ohio State and let me tell you I thoroughly enjoyed escape Indiana had cough that they had taken the lead I they were out early they'd come back they had taken the lead they caught the ball up right before half time they gave back to back touchdowns Ohio State\nThe score was twenty eight twenty they did their best to hang around after that I'm Still had a chance going into the fourth quarter Ohio State just too much for the they run away with the two touchdowns in the fourth\nForty nine twenty six Haskins was just I thought fantastic\nUh foreigners and fifty five yards six touchdowns a thirty three of forty four I'm just did everything without those type of numbers this is a whole different game that was turned over I felt was so big but Indiana hung around Ohio State do flex their muscles I'm nothing to be ashamed about ... said this was this was a good at the other team\nYeah well I I don't know I mean I thought it was a little bit of a sloppy effort by Ohio State they had they ended up with nine penalties for almost a hundred yards\nUm they they they just you know the defense wasn't as good as it usually is give over four hundred yards off at the asking was phenomenal and they won the game and I do wonder again it kinda the opposite of what I was saying with Georgia, Georgia maybe looking ahead\nOhio State kind of what that hangover game after that wild when it gets Penn State last week\nYou when you know I always say this and I I think it's true in this case with Ohio State it was a little bit sloppy they still ended up winning by three touchdowns and then the bigger thing is\nDoesn't matter get the wind move onto the next one nobody's going to remember fewer sloppy this week or you were good that week or doesn't matter just get that winning keep racking up wins because you do that you'll find yourself where every Ohio State fan wants them at the end of the year which is competing for national champs\nI was going to say the theme of Tonight Show is tradition\nI a grown up in Connecticut I grew up as a Red Sox fan but there really is not very much like a big playoff game in the Bronx oh no no no and I know I I you know it's crazy I haven't actually been to the new Yankee Stadium yet because it open right around the time that I moved out here and maybe not maybe move like two or three years earlier but anyways\nThe point being I haven't been there yet I heard it's not quite the same but it seemed like last year for those playoff games everybody was up for it I'm excited to watch I'm excited to see and it's been a fun it's been a ...\nIt's been awesome so uh we'll see what happens there or Washington state of thirty five thirty over Oregon states are about to start to forget that one\nAre you going to criticize Washington state because they're giving up thirty plus to Oregon State I couldn't care less about watching the idea that there are a good team for and what coming on and I'm surprised that ... cause I thought they would go ahead and and route Oregon State I think the games in Corvallis so maybe that's why it's it's closer than I thought\nYou know I have a great can I tell a great get fired for talking about Washington state Oregon State I think can I give a great Corvallis story really quite yeah go ahead now will really gets fired but go ahead no I have a buddy who is an assistant coach up there I won't name the sport but apparently Corvallis it's a little it's a little hard on\nThe eyes let me put it it's not the most scenic place and he was talking to a buddy his who was an assistant coach at an opposing school that the other team came in for a road game and he stops them in the handshake line before the game he says this place is so awful you got the NCAA should allow you guys to cheat to get players up\nOff that I'll never forget that that's my only valid or yeah I'm also later tonight we're waiting for the McGregor fight\nI mean how long do we have to wait for this what is it is it going to be starting like after three o'clock in the morning on the east coast or what\nI Know well I Hope I Hope it's on by the time we get off I think

get to the ...\nI Believe we have one at Tony Ferguson against Anthony pet is in the uh Kobe and events\nThat is the one fight before I'm assuming this is going to determine who's going to face\nThe winner of the main event so are they worried about a sudden the east coast it's going to be like one in the morning you know how it is Arnie with boxing they don't care about that like we may whether we'd come out and fight or some of these big name boxers would come out and fight like nine o'clock Pacific time it would be like midnight on the east coast that how it always has been in the fight games\nDo have a ... latest odds on this ... Gregor McCoy is one fifty I think\nMcGregor was is the dog in this and a lot of people would a kind of be like what kind of regret it but people don't ... people have got to remember hey guys and fought in two years and the ... and this guy could be\nWho the people who don't wrestle bears that he wrestled bears defeat the guy's undefeated I've talked to Joe and it's about this this guy's Savage if everybody everybody assuming that caught or McGregor is just going to walk over and when this is going to be a ... there's only one if you can get it on pay per view get it on paper ...\nI was going to say I could see Arnie battling bears for food out there in the woods every night for dinner absolutely that's what I have to do what do you think I here so I got so tired the next day\nWell I thought it was because he hosted radio to all hours of the night but I Know that could be too but you know hunting for food or also gets a little tiresome that's good do you have like a like a ...

Nick Saban when he um lane kissing and I don't remember I I don't I don't know if I can say this word on air but it was uh something chewing that he gave ...\nYes I remember that yeah it was with which I Believe he did that just a just to flex its muscle but go ahead\nBut they won the national championship that year nobody else did they were up thirty eight to ten in the fourth quarter ...\nChewing makes you win the national championship is that is that what was that he didn't get that yells such jumbo Fisher grab one of his players by the bass bass that means he's going to win a national championship no well\nMaybe who knows I mean first of all the player said he had no problem with it but the point with Nick Saban if you had let me get to ask why is that you're you said oh 'cause he yells\nWill no other coach is going to yell at his off into coordinator in the fourth quarter with under a minute to go but you know what maybe the next time that are offensive Cornell does the exact same thing but instead of it being a thirty eight to ten game\nIt's a thirty five thirty two game and he ended up losing a game and so you hold everyone to such an insanely high standard they actually talked about in the broadcast today Greg Mac or who played for the next day and he said yeah the hardest part of every week is Tuesday Wednesday Thursday practice\nAnd so when you hold everybody to such a high standard ... and like I said every coach thinks that they bust their but look\nI was about to say gee I've not heard that on any other program that the hardest days of the week or Tuesday Wednesday Thursday right you know\nWell it yeah and so you play Alabama Saturday I but I Can't and so no and I mean I think that's every walk of life I mean why do you and I have a national radio show when there's a there's a million guys that whole hosts sports talk radio it's because we held ourselves to a higher standard we did something\nThat um you know we have done something in our careers we have worked harder got pictures we got we got pictures as well so the other guys don't have pictures\nUh I liked it I can read that says saving in Bamako are the best of cheating plain and simple oh my God oh heating are we going to go up that road are we going to we're going to be that bad officials well hold on to that thought for a little bit will will come back we'll finish up the top twenty five\nWill finish talking about why Alabama and Nick Saban is not better but head and shoulders better\nThan everybody else he's Aaron tourism only spend your this is ... sports are ideal\nCollege would fall [laughter]\nSevering catch every mumble hammering touched down when it comes to see the LA football coverage on your radio\nWanting me ... face is Fox Sports radio\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or that award basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nThrough ... also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their or certify dealer network at nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars\nYou'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience whether you buy newer use\nAnd withdrew car uses can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy faster buying experience by connecting with two cars certify dealers\nWhen you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy more confident car by experience some features not available all states\nIf you suffer from E.

E. C. championship game and who has\nRight there you go or top five or ... top four plus one because as a\nA Aaron says that if one not significant right now I ... did they expend the play off the five teams I mean my goodness you're acting like these four tied in with cement already that there is no chance the other one is going to get on and there's going to be plenty of losing before the seasons don't don't worry about that I\nI promise you that real quick I Want to bring up the patriots but if you think they're back on track if you think a victory over adopted team which let's be honest treatment disappointed that doubles every and got off the bus for that game but if you think of beating adopted even them being the cold feet which had like\nForty or thirty eight healthy bodies for that game\nThat was a debacle I mean they they really are the worst team in the NFL they're absolutely horrible if you think that gets the patriots back on track your fooling yourselves I Know everybody was all excited that Edelman was catching passes and the up and say look so much better\nThey still let Andrew Luck pick them apart and it was still a southern boy came I Believe in the third quarter um that that's not good it does is still not patriot ask and I think they're gonna you're gonna see that I get the Kansas City and Chicago\nThe patriots are never patriots ask in September they always get better in October November and December like write a coach team they get better\nAnd I I'm I'm so did you just tell me the culture the worst team in the NFL is that what you told me the dolphin ... the Colts are worse than the other than Arizona you're out of your mind\nHere's the deal with the Colts first of all that opening week against the bangles they were leading after three quarters couldn't hold on to win the bangles maybe a lot better than I think a lot of people realize they lose by four at Philly they lose by three and overtime against the Texans we know how that game went down last week at\nSo to me the culture like two or three plays from being three and two are foreign one instead of wanted for so I just don't buy that they're that bad\nAnd he went to the the um [noise] the police saying that the ... the he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all\nAnd you know and of course every year there was X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes you wonder if er but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know there's always go and train your candy I mean\nReally do you do people really you know you\nAre the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the\nDentist office X ray at the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know for something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out\nYou don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the\nWhole thing is just silly now my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so that you can see all the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] and then all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy\nThe horror right you'd actually have families coming together to make a kid's costume ...\nAnd what you find is that the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks a really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff\nYou know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask trapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell on a good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and\nAnd you know we with each and every with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit um\nAnd I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nThat I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid what eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think is inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors national for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual go you know where you\nGot like holy crap [laughter] do you do that because that was the giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to a asking about this

think that Texas is back to where they were we got high standards for taxes even remember Andy were Vince Young is running against what was thought to be the greatest team in the history of college football in USC\nAnd Vince Young proved otherwise in the national championship game so\nTo say Texas is back to that standard we heard this all the time with the EU\nWith Miami last year and their research into the U.S back in the U.S nowhere close to being back to where they once were so I think that the standards for taxes you can't save their back based on a win against Oklahoma who they very well could drop a couple of other games before it's all said and done this year\nWell I mean it is a heck of a winter says it's a tremendous when really Oklahoma three time defending twelve champion I mean really truly this is a big win for harm and probably the biggest win\nIn his career a business with ... yeah I mean I tell you what this this game does I think the ... the quarterback of Oklahoma Idaho Heisman contention there really does\nI wouldn't go that far it hurts it hurts big time because I don't know where the last is going to be for Alabama and taco by lowering has been spectacular and when the schedule gets a little bit tougher maybe we'll see him in the second half [laughter] you know the numbers get a little bit healthier so that hurt Tyler Murray\nHe's still did play well the sixty seven yard touchdown run was amazing the fumble hurt when he was scrambling around it\nYou know uh you know like had the ball on the ground you trying to gain regained his balance and he fumbled that was a bad turn over but all things considered I still think that he's in the mix\nBut you know what Texas I don't want a twisted that's an enormous when I'm just sitting here telling you I don't think that's a win where you say for sure Tom Herman got Texas they're back they dropped the first case against Maryland we can't forget that\nAnd they got a big games on the schedule down the road plus they got Oklahoma State and I I think Oklahoma State you don't know what you're going to get a week to week last time I was there yesterday in Stillwater but still and all that they've Oklahoma State to the explosive ball club and I think that right now Texas will face a couple of more hurdles before the end of the year but\nI got to talk about the big blue and we

Patrick my homeless but here's the key can the cheap stuff they're running game of the Jazz Can they stop limited for net that's the\nDoubt so yeah I Am an issue yes so I thought he was going to be TJ yelled in you're going to be that it's gonna be a little bit running back by committee but they can still run the ball effectively look at the chief defund they're allowing a league high five point seven three yards per Kerry and this is short week so\nYou got that going on you think about that she was playing on Monday Night football and they've been playing atrocious the fence chest smelly stinky nasty defense and the ... yes it's been brutal man where they think about this and I love doing this because\nWhile the chiefs I haven't had thereby week I Love looking at the total yards given up for the entire season you've got the patriots who you wouldn't say they've been world leaders defensively right right right you've got the patriots right now\nPlaying an extra game compared to the chiefs write the patriots have given up to one eighty three more yard this year than the chiefs you think there's a chance that uh the jags gained twenty four yards at least today [laughter] total\nOh I see is a good chance so when this is all said and done you're going to the Kansas City on the bottom again most likely in terms of given up\nOn I'm going to go back and I'm Glad you told me this I didn't know limit for net will be out today but now I'm hearing from our produce that he'd be up several weeks with a hamstring\nAnd I and I thought that like when I last time I looked all heard that he might be available for today and now they seem to be out several weeks without hamstring I mean I I had no idea but that really to me maybe I'm wrong I don't think it was a well publicized I thought he might be in the lineup today\nAre you using a different Internet Andy [laughter]\nLike a different a Web browser or something\nAnd I thought he was dead on good I'm betting on this game and the honest [laughter] uh well ... you know they can still\nLike I said they can still have a lot of success against that Kansas City defense regardless if it's the J yelled in or Leonard for net healthy writer for net is dynamic there is no doubt but it's not like that ground game has no chance to do anything whatsoever against the Casey rushed defense\nHe's he's just brutal they're bright all against the run so I think that you can absolutely have success against them\nWhen it comes to the combination TJ yelled and going to get the bulk loaded the carries but you go see some Corey Grant on drafted free agent\nOut of Auburn you know he's been in the league for a couple of years\nSo I you know you can you can still match points against that case the defense it's just one of these where they had let her for nets had a lotta nagging injury he missed three starts last season he's going to miss this third start this season\nGonna miss more weeks with that nagging hamstring injury so it's unfortunate that that he's weak it's just he just kick it right health wise\nHe's brittle that's what he is he really is you know you look at I think we took we touched on this list we get a look at the chief stash\nAnd if you know not looking at the one last record you definitely would say that he would be five hundred a below with the stats that they have especially on defense even time a possession of the opponent well obviously Tama position they're not going to happen because they're on the field so quickly they scored and that's the end of it\nBut honestly the total net yards like they give it up almost Nineteen hundred yards it it's amazing average birthday one twenty three they're only gaining one Thirteen again for themselves and\nAverage per game as far as what the total us three twenty eight given up to two Ninety seven these are good stats I mean really and truly therefore no one it's hard to believe that they are\nWell that often just been so dynamic have been unbelievable offensively and I can't wait to see just scheme wise you know it's Patrick ... has been outstanding I'm not saying it's just the scheme\nBut what Andy Reid has been able to do just schemes certain match ups where they can take advantage I Want to see just magically what Andy Reid comes up with against the jaguars defense because if you're getting pressure consistently and

the bottom of the barrel here and you're going to have to have some of these lesser known receivers really step up and they're going to get really creative against the lions defense now\nThink about when the lions smacked around the patriots I think it's very very comparable because you've got Jimmy Graham is very good and very capable tight and you just double him like drunk enforce these receivers on the outside the\nYou and what they banged up Aaron Rodgers at least he's not as healthy as he typically would be what they're saying that knee injury\nI think it lends itself to the same type of scenario as we saw when the lion smacked around the patriots so don't fall into the trap of thinking that just because he's Aaron Rodgers the Packers are going to be fine Tom Brady is

right now\nI think the Packers have less of a margin for error then the lions doing I think the better team than the lines I think they went but again if the loose today the lions when that really puts a stranglehold and that division\nIt's just all about today Andy at full strength yeah look at the Packers more than the lions but\nThe Packers are not at full strength and it's all about when the game's happen we say any given Sunday for a reason you know my ... it's about timing and this is a bad time for the Packers\nAnd if you want to talk about the lions and converting touchdowns and all that that's fine but when the patriots only put up ten points the last time the lions played a home game you don't have to convert many touchdowns veered off and you know you're very well how many points you think the Packers Gore today is\nThe fact is good about thirty today I was oh your ... your hours of your mind I think God I just worry about starting Andy ...\nThey'll go running every day that he weighs roughly they write this down I Want you to write this down because next week I'll I'll eat crow or I'm going to be banking on my chest\nI say they win thirty Seventeen today right that oh my gosh yes ... thirty points and yes yes it does oh who's going to step up note about Adams no Randall Cobb no drawn to mow Alice than all out\nOf that fine right now that you know large already boy Aaron Rodgers creates he creates okay who's leading them last week against the bills\nIt's a bad team you know something like this is a form of you play your competition you really do\nThat it's okay so are the lions world leaders you just really a big convert touched that okay so why what kinds of lions bring out the Packers ...\nAnd I know I'm making you feel bad because you probably have some ... on this game and you take\nI don't yet but I've talked myself into it I upload doubling\nAlly in the debate and that's fine unless you are good for you by the way did you discover card but

well let's give you Jackson another year to work with them and that's may save his job\nIt's possible just depends exactly how the season unfolds\nAnd not only what their record is but how did they and do they end on a two game winning streak and there's a lot of positivity and ownership says well now Maine screw it I mean that's looking pretty good were pointing in the right direction whatever it's all about how they finish not just their overall record\nSo it it's a coin flip at this point whether he was going to be back but what do you think's going to happen today is this beggars first when at home against arena the amount of\nNot at all either they're able to know better team and certainly I think that they're able to put up a lot of points against him today too I guess you don't\nWant to have been overlooked Andy is all the Baker focus what happened to that Brown's defense last week I liked their defense overall and they've got absolutely torched by Derek car who by the way only had six touchdown passes in seven interceptions this year and Derek car\nHad a field day against the browns so I don't know what their defense is going to do today against Joe Flaco in the ravens when the ravens have had a lot of success against the over the\nAnd here's another factor I think a lot of people talk about\nThe browns they may have some personnel and have a decent defence and offensively against the run gained gone maybe who knows and the Baker's love fest I Know but at the end of the day this team doesn't know how to win because they've never won I think that means a lot in sports not just in football they don't know how to when they don't know how to close\nAnd then I don't know how to win and that's going to hurt them until they get a couple of winds together they're going to be in trouble and they'll be in trouble today Brian oh Andy for him and probably brought the about ... what does it mean one guy was just Fifteen minutes could save you a Fifteen

explain that and just about a minute he's Brian no I mean different movie coolest Fox football suddenly by the way we want to welcome everybody that of Fox Sports radio studios brought to you by Geico it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or moral car insurance with Geico got a guy go dot com or coal eight hundred nine four seven or do they only hard part\nFiguring out which way it's easier by the barrel betting comes along in about ten minutes but now and as well for urban mentioned it's you and me on the field today I mean you know that it you know ten pages without ... each other you're Miami Dolphins ... bangles\nAnd the reports that the dolphins three of those start was maybe the beginning of a new day for dolphins football and they have seized let's face it not be they were overblown overblown they were premature they were embarrassed by New England thirty eight seven and honesty I got a good point to the schedule maybe for or at least it says\nWell that titans when looks a lot better after the titans beat the eagles\nBut uh that's easily their most impressive when beating the jets and also um\n[noise] beating the raiders that wasn't you know everything to\nJust write home about ... yeah it was a it was a flimsy three you know and they were absolutely expose by the patriots which is not a shock at all with the patriots being one into and people counting them out now the demise and you knew that they were going to be completely laser focused and they absolutely crushed the dolphins\nSo this week going up against the bangles\nThat in theory or line for the dolphins they're all fence of line is incredibly bang up you have their center Daniel killed Gore he's on I are you also have Josh didn't the guard who is on I ... that is not good to be weak\nIn the interior of your offensive line when you've got Gino Adkins on that van Gogh the line the guy is absolutely nasty man that is not a good combination for the fence\nWell I'll I'll say this to me it's so at the bank sucking me excuses why your team may lose today but there's no trial I for and what he happened did you see that late last week yeah I mean it was just I mean they didn't want to show the replay on TV when your leg just one way and your foot is facing the other\nI mean that was disgusting I mean he was you saw two years when they caught him out he was crying I mean I don't blame him I mean this guy's got like the worst health\nLuck in the world's got no luck so he's\nGone he broke his ankle job or not the running game he's gone now for the bangles as well but ... says perfect makes just returned if that have four game suspension\nI I think the game being at home and and what the bagels have offensively even despite job or not not playing with AJ green playing a tremendous football and really in the dorm playing maybe the best football all of his career this year\nYeah I just think that the Bengals or a better team with the\nDolphins coming love that that's being smacked around by the pages I think the bagels when this game and I think they may when the big\nWell the bangles it's again it's the recent history why people are reluctant to buy in and they're seeing that poses a lot of problems you have Joe mixing back there with that knee injury you should be an action\nI Know you as you mentioned geo Bernard is out but if you get Joe mixing back in when he's healthy you the difference maker\nAnd that's a big loss losing Tyler I for when he is contributing man that often says really really tough I got a lot of weapons they still do but they're really complete when you have ... and his past catching ability and\nLike you said the back injuries and those issues and he's missed a lot of games finally gets healthy and then\nJust this flu play gets rolled up on during a tackled nothing dirty and he just snaps in ankle Huettel\nAnd and you could tell when he was being wheeled off all the hard work that goes into being in a position to be able to contribute and that's taken away that someone like\nJust taking your guts out you know it's it's absolutely demoralizing so you feel for a guy like that but there's ... definitely gonna be an an impact on that van goes off and not having I for it out there\nYou know I'll say this and I followed the Bengals for years is living in the area the one thing the thing will seem to have this year probably more so than in years past in recent years past that is they have big play ability and the officer side of the football yeah they've got a good pass Russia's no doubt about that but they never really had the big bang bang big play and they got\nThat right now they got Tyler Boyd as a as a limit to AJ green and the offensive side of the ball and I think that really poses a lot of problems for the fences especially a team but the Miami Dolphins or not that strong defensively they're really not\nYeah man that's a great one to combo there's no doubt Tyler Boyd is\nVery much overlooked because of AJ grain it's similar to\nIf you look at Calvin Ridley the rookie he's not going to get a ton of props because he's playing with ... Jones you know [laughter] so I was going to get all the\nAttention and all the conversation with Tyler Boyd is a very very good number two receiver he's solid he's a consistent\nSo you know this bangles team if they can bring together some wins here this should be a win this will be a very bangles laws if they found a way to kick the scale way\nOnly to say right now if they lose today in Cincinnati all the year goes out of the bubble it was going to be a will always me and it's going to use the fencing same old bangles yeah especially if they kick it away the same old bangles you know and that's the way the fans are but you know really a truly you have to understand they used to that in Cincinnati they really are\nTwo and three Brian now it looks like you're on a\nLittle bit of injury wouldn't give me two or three you you say I got two out of do you want to and one two in one two out of the ... same thing\nIs it's not legal legal maniac real yeah hey man I say\nNow what did I miss what did I miss I was hoping for three you know the\nOnly one you missed was a Rosen throwing over two hundred two hundred point five passing yards he actually had one eighty on the day so\nI'm clear to me it is or the other one I thought was funny or you know the uh the giants and the saints were playing each other and we had you know combined touchdown passes by both quarterbacks only one was thrown in that game\nIt was not nearly a shoot out that we did we thought it might be so did indeed take the over on that one yeah I took the over\nYeah we'll just say for yourself from and\nI have to go to the bathroom [laughter] and I had that might throws by the way Andy I missed that that I had\nThe over in this thing's giants game and they just could not get on track band and finally ... scored at the end when they're basically running the clock out and it gave me a glimmer of hope and Eli Manning against to prevent the feds he was like\nYeah why don't I just hold the ball you along and take it you're that can build a ball that\nAppears no for taking the over that's what he lies that was the lawyer the whole the whole time that was ruining the game let's move on please on getting All right\nYeah so you guys were talking about it a little bit earlier high over under fifty eight for the falcons Steelers later today\nI actually think it's an e for that over under I think it's an easy over so I made my own over under for this game well over under sixty five and a half in falcons and Steelers and if you remember the bangles and the falcons last week it was a Seventy three total for that so that's that's how I kinda got it so Brian\nSixty five and a half over under falcons Steelers\nAnd adjusted lined by you I I have to take the under just based on the odd your point Ryan it could it could go over I wouldn't be shocked but the odds favor the under so I'll take that\nYou know it's funny you mentioned that I I look at I look at the total right now just gave about sixty three I gotta go wonder which I Love my ... but now I gotta start winning but there's I looked like a fool John going on\nRight now I Will switch over here are you guys were also talking about this gym in Ramsey entire retail they've been doing a little trash talking back and forth leading to their or jags at Kansas City on Sunday\n...

corners on the Philadelphia Eagles if in fact they can I make ... concurred causes get that could have success suggests that today that the ... the basic key I think of this game\nOh yeah absolutely can no doubt and\nIt was a joke for her cousins\nTo get criticized after the performance against the rams it's insane to me you know it's like people will criticized Tom Brady\nFor losing to the eagles and the super bowl did you see the patriots the fence you know what I mean like if you look at current cousins last week against the rams he had a great game over three hundred and fifty yards passing three touchdown pass I think it was over four hundred\nActually have a great game you know and you're going to put that on Kirk or criticize him before the defense that defense was atrocious against the rams so I just hate when\nA lot of people overlook obvious flaws an obvious deficiencies to just go straight to the quarterback and be landscape not get it done you hear that a lot with Matthew Stafford in the ... and the the lions you know\nHe has it been walking on water but there are a lot more things to blame than just Matthew Stafford so I think that ... cousins in the same division is in that same ballpark right now where you overlook other deficiencies and go straight to him it's crazy\nWhen I was almost a further maybe we could see we've Orwell could see a shootout in this camp listed a lot of these on both sides I could see a school or maybe in the high sixties combined on this game\nHigh sixties today yeah yeah yeah [noise] why he used to shoot out huh it could very well be I I think Jesus could\nPut up about thirty and maybe or something like maybe thirty four thirty one something like that again like that thirty five\nWell I I don't see it that high I don't I see it somewhere in the twenties but I haven't seen the eagles off since really get on track yet and yet the eagles played tough defense at home they really do they're really good defensively so\nUm I don't see it being that high scoring but it's one of these games not great records one two and one versus too into\nIt it's a huge game for both they got out showing Jeffrey back on the eagles have I'll show just going to help that they had over a hundred yards receiving last week so I mean he's going to help protect the Vikings ... you know it's for the eagles so I think that's a bit it's a big\nDeal but uh you know I I just\nI I it's hard for me to picture a team that was so dominant last year but they were only ... you mentioned dominant down the stretch\nAnd as one of those things you get a role and you catch that role I think the ravens did that in the super bowl you they roll towards the end they rolled rented to the super bowl that is what happens you know and yeah it's a situation where a team that starts off poorly\nThat's a bigger I guess the taboo for fans maybe even media of a team goes like one in three like they freaked out on the patriots early on but as you say if they go to in to down the stretch in December it's not going to be as bad as they go to in two in September there's just the way it is\nYou're right you're right yeah yeah but hey listen sometimes teams freak out just like fans do you do sometimes teams they start pressing\nAnd they get in their own way so we'll see if the the Vikings can avoid pressing tool fault you know I think they're like times where there's a sense of urgency and your laser focused and you're locked in and it helps\nAnd there are other times you just try to do too much like bell check always breaches do your job it's like you're trying to do three jobs at one time it just\nIt doesn't work like that so I'm really curious who gets on track tonight or today is it going to be that Vikings defense or will it be that eagles off and and that's going to be a that's going to be a big factor and who wins today and good\nGames for twenty five eastern time that game was on Fox he's Brian ... by the way this

let's remember that that rams team when we're talking about\nYou know brain and cooks or the burger wide receiver but as he reached the status of the cruise ship you know ... I mean you know you think about him another guy not going to make the hall of fame I probably will Marshall FARC hall of fame running back maybe talk girlie can hit those sites and Kurt Warner\nAt the time you know we didn't know what Kurt Warner was but\nThat that Cooper so special this group could very well be there today of course you know against Seattle this is the last stand really for the sea hawks right if the rams aren't going to run away with this division they got to win today up at century Lincoln take advantage of that on field last time these two teams played\nSeattle able forty two points but his body Wagner pointed out I was on the field that day the federal linebacker he does make a difference to the sea hawks but look I talked to a girl with this week and man\nYou talk about confidence it is losing from the rams team he's saying the guys are ... basically when ... when the game playing each week like what is this guy come up with this we are we going to be the

homes is due for his first interception of the season although he's been tremendous do you agree with that and more importantly how do you see Patrick ... homes faring today\nYeah I think Patrick moms will be fine I mean you know but what's interesting is okay the Broncos were able to give him sits in the first how are they going to be able to continue\nTo you know there's some things at the ... were able to pick up watching a video that that may be some flaws\nIn Patrick my home's game there are flaws and Patrick ... really just want to make sure our listeners don't see them do you look at the stab one fourteen touched down\nHero interceptions he and Drew Brees the only starters from ... in the starting lineup we have not wrote an intersection the season among the thirty two quarterback so I I mean look I think it's been it's been an amazing thing for the sheets what he's been able to do not making the intercept what he was doing in the pre season remember that was the big story\nThe narrative that we're counting its interceptions during the practices and everyone was thinking oh well to treat you are going to take a step back because there's no Alex the country's going to have to step up hasn't been the case so far\nFor Jacksonville not having one or two that hurts but I think actually I think the quarterback we might be talking about at the end of the day\nIt's like quarter yes I think\nWhat's going to I think it's going to have a good day I'm not sold on this Kansas City ... it's a nice thing is against the Broncos but I think the drugs are a little bit better and pass

one\nInteresting I tell you what Alice mothers it seems as as the Iliad goes so goes the Dallas Cowboys just wanted to\nAnd those games elite had an average like sixteen carried to game the cowboys that was like Thirteen points last week they gave the bull twenty nine times twenty five carries for receptions here to do for the scrimmage and they beat the lions it's not that hard really give is equally at the football\nRight I mean and that's what they have to do they got nothing else or what do they have often they got over the years I've been tight end what no one is scaring you on that team you got you got two guys you got that who is it OK quarterback I mean you know really in at this point\nAfter that great OK season taper off and some of it is supporting cap I I mean I think a lot of it has to be honest with you\nSo it's ... be kept the metal the Houston Texans ... look what happened last week with the cold I get the port of auto a Frank right at all we're going to play to win the game and all that sort of stuff right but they could have buried the Houston Texans oh three and one is just saying basically as oh and for\nThat would have been it for the Texans season we could have really written them off and that division instead the costs go for the poor down don't convert Texan score and the final minutes and keep their season alive and I think they've got that momentum going wasn't tonight into Houston playing at home and then I'd football and this is a rivalry game I mean there's a lot about the state of Texas and I say that not 'cause 'cause they only play once every\nFour years but there's fans in Texas can be swayed if you're a longtime cowboys fan all of a sudden the decrease in facts and start winning and destroy Watson's trying exciting

around maybe he was a very standards was around ... bombs was around ... slowly had back\nThen yeah I mean but you know look for for Green Bay that the good part is that they should be able to make some hay and the running game today and and mitigate the absence of some of the wide receivers that it's a mess and we look Randall cop drawn to Adams these guys may not be able to go to our animal Alison as banged up and that's been a lead a whole bunch of young target for let's not forget to they have Jimmy grant\nYou could find can be Graham out as a wide receiver you're looking to make some things up on the up and to try to the football but ... but as we saw last week a new leader Suzie Kelly and his mobster game against Detroit\nThis isn't a good wines team against the law they have a tendency to really get cash in the Packers I wouldn't be surprised if we see or one heavy attack today try not to put too much on young guys who\nQuite honestly are really ready to contribute as much as a starter on that Green Bay off it became pretty short today I mean look at this are they going to be able to get some momentum going for them before this division slips away their their chip

think about the evils maybe not making the players and what do they do today against the Vikings\nOh come on come on we pay anything on the eagles already everyone's\nBeen hurt this was a teen those are probably going to start slow and who's going to start to pick up some momentum as a season goes on and that's how I look at it you know for this cheap because they've been so banged up in the loss of their hurting against that you got a no dark Bennett in the in the lineup and that's a big loss\nThe administration now sanctions would snap back on Tehran after President Trump pulled out of the

going to regret long term because every\nTime of the road I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are

exactly right then they could we could go if we would have had like ... or ... or China I think he can hear that we might not ... ... and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut

conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is then now we're in a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter] you are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that is like you both for being with us he couldn't get teen votes I mean\nHe was like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the north east New Hampshire not interested and Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and an nobody's interested in the guy that says no I'm only

the games on the fourth quarter he's a big deal he's able to do and accomplish a lot\nThe best the best part about this for the rams\nThey haven't had to use him like that right so as you mentioned later on during the season let's say come we ate and you're All right we need to some teams you know maybe the games are tighter or some of these teams have a you know you're better off running against and maybe they have explosives ... that's when he's going to be fresh\nHe's at ... you know he's 'cause he's not being use thirty thirty five times just simply running it I mean yeah you just the ball definitely in the back to it as a receiver but they're not running the ball thirty thirty five times of them beating them down wearing them down so I think he's going to be for a second half of the season when they really may decide to start going to have some more\nUm interesting it'd be interesting to see that for sure the writers are down here\nAnd soul\nNo signal yet looks like maybe they were stopped short the one yard line trying to score touched down here against the charges charges up twenty six to three up\nBig on the raiders man tough season right now for the raiders as we mentioned there one in three looks either going to want it for and it could have been on five to ... to get robbed last week\nUm do you think about that they're going to have a\nExtremely high draft pick if this continues why would be wide open touchdown oh because it looks like a tight in was wide open on the outside to hurry up got the ball right as the the rough set the ball down and they hike it and they just do it all the way out to the rise with that title was joining us it could be joining us I\nCouldn't see has already Nelson why how was your knee Nelson wide open\nBecause I Want to see the replay how this happened so again they got down to the one that was not a touchdown they broke the I don't know why they went over the huddle in yeah just for some reason\nThe best receiver maybe the best receive are the two teams Keenan Allen may feel differently ... city wide open and they scored a\nTouchdown and fill the rivers despite having currently a Seventy boy Lee waiting on the on ... an suing extra point\nHe wasn't happy about that now he's mad because that shouldn't happen right no matter how fast the team\nGoes and gets up to the line you have responsibility so as a quarterback you look oh\nThere was a receiver out here that just a receiver though Jody Nelson their best to reverse\nIt when they say now they they wouldn't want a play called that was a hard\nNoticing that his receiver was uncovered so he came up and said Peter Peter Peter\nThe ball quick and just toss it out there nobody was move nobody else move off into want nobody move [laughter] that's one of those\nYou know veteran type ... calls than when you see something that the defense is given you you exploited\nAh the eagles are on the move right about the twenty a yard line of the Vikings trying to get into the red zone trying to put us the points they have a whole basically a whole fourth quarter left fourteen minutes left\nAnd they're down twenty six Vikings up big and this one a couple of touchdowns but you know the way these guys have been going anything is possible we've seen that all day to day we're just talking about the bagels chemicals or twenty for the fourth quarter\nSo this uh they're still in this game the eagles especially when you have a quarterback as dynamic as Carson which\nUm he's running hard\nSeahawks again in the ramp side twenty four twenty four just under five minutes left in that game\nBig time game for the Seahawks if they're able to pull this out and go right the ship if you will get the two and three and have a nice division when it gets a team that we all pretty much say is the best team in football uh\nAnd it's been it's been a kind of a a different couple of different ways they've done it has just been the Russell Wilson delight but he's so special to me I said this again I had a conversation with the local ah Seattle team a Seattle radio station and I was told him I said look man they they always ask me this question\nUh every time we do a do it a couple times a year they say\nOne guy the whole teams coming off the bus you give we give you a frying pan who's the one guy and knock it out and I said well you guys aren't that talented right now so I have to go to Russell Wilson is because he's the magic man he's still can make things happen and here he is right now keeping this even gets the best team in the league in one of the best defenses league right now twenty four type\nYeah he he definitely has a lot on his plate I mean the\nThe the success of the more him or Aaron Rodgers and reading and Roger\nAnd Roger's because Aaron Rodgers has had more for longer\nRight Joe refused to give them a defense they refuse to get them all running game you gotta remember Russell Wilson came into the league with a great running game and a great defense\nSo he was able to learn and he was able to have success Aaron Rodgers ... hey do like you're so good you just make it happen\nClean bill of rivers right now doing his thing and he is ready to thirty nine yards couple touchdowns will but at the theme of the red zone again so he can be adding to that uh he still has two minutes thirty seconds left or the way the ads are more points with ... having a good day so far those are your quarterbacks in Spanish you ...\nYou do quarterbacks I'm going to be running back you know over into Lyman loved to block but a running back everybody to run the bat that's just the facts social service acorn Barclay\n[noise] they throw at the fact\nHe might as well ah put a obey Jay quarterback goes a long struggle limited but that was a courtesy of WFAN a giants radio network or the ... we Fifteen carry for the yard but he added\nBoard care or for catches eighty one yard that long when we just heard and to judge now is that it was the last\nUh he got a little bank that we'll find out a little bit later how serious that injury as hopefully can bounce back ... a mixed up tiger early\nFor two inches away from the goal line rivers on\nCurly headed by the time\nUh that was a ... year early from Ninety three point one jak after him rams radio network are currently game still going on here fourteen

Nineteen carries fifty a yard touchdown for reception six who yards you have to be dual threat to be honest with their money back you're\nRight about that I'm actually shocked to see how well ... has been out of the back of receiving this year you know I Know he lost a lot of weight and really taking it seriously or get onto the receiver we'll start with somebody who was humid you could have been a quarterback today was well through a touchdown pass and he caught some as well although bucking junior\n[noise] oh\n... really did that okay that was my bat near that does go to ... ...\n... what was right in the right way to\nThrough a sea hawk down put down that way and the rams are back on the high side\nThat's Ninety three one jak FM rams radio network there Cooper copying a guy again that
