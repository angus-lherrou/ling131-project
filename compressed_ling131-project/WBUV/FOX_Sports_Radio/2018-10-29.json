the backbone of the show the one who shows up in the answers the bell every single round\nThe next time there's a disagreement don't just automatically side with Brady and the disagreement okay don't just automatically signed with daddy remember when daddy walked out on that one week and just remember mommy's been here the whole time\nWhen mommy when I went to go speak a mommy mommy told me not to speak because they were busy but then when somebody else walks in the studio they have a full blown conversation laughing and joking\nI'm trying to make dinner uh-huh trying to make dinner huh and

do you want me to write the chauffeur Jonas do and book the\nGas I look a ... it's what I've always said it it could be worse you can be a Dodger fan so that's that's I mean speaking of which\nJust lie but Jesus going to make an appearance that Chavez Ravine and I I have no idea reason why I'm asking is because we're only in the first inning and keep in mind the over under in this ball game between the red Sox and the Dodgers that seven and a half will postings incursions showed up Steve Pearce with a two run shot in the top of the first inning\nDid the red Sox it's you nothing advantage but David freezing the bottom of the first\nFirst pitch you saw you what the opposite field it's true one Boston right now just in terms of just walk\nOne on it and nobody out in the bottom of the first Dodgers again down to one they're down this series three games to one and of course National Football league action all across the south la Los Angeles rams they are now eight noticed season thinks it is\nGoing to grab the favor and bring it out of hand to Fifteen any\n\nJars of all time I got\nYeah rams when it twenty nine twenty seven to kick the ball up after a few a goal and it was about ... fun to play in the fourth quarter and Rodgers doesn't even get a shot to win the ballgame for Green Bay\nColds go on the road and beat the raiders forty two twenty ... twenty five carries for a buck thirty two and two scores\nAnd the Arizona Cardinals have Chu wins this season and they both came at the hands with their Francisco forty niners eight seed fifty was a bottle score Josh Rosen with a game winning touchdown pass layer Fitzgerald eight grams for a hundred yards and also one CD Sunday Night Football from Minnesota\nSeeing it's worth a ball right now they're inside the five your line knocking on the door there is no score again it's the games opening position\nAnd we got all of a sea or the games around National Football league from this morning eagles over the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Bengals beat the bucks thirty seven thirty for\nKansas City chiefs continue to dominate Patrick my home's twenty four thirty four three ... three through the airport

did you know the last ... can you guess the last quarter back to ever be the Steelers in Pittsburgh last Brown's quarterback to ever be the Steve\nI'm going to take a guess and said Derek Anderson ooh\nGood guess above what would you like a shot at this last round quarterback to beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh\nWhere are you going [laughter] I mean that's a very good guess Eric Roberts you want to take a stab but this was a year or a Johnny Manziel all ... in debt that also is a good guess all of those are incorrect though attempt\nCouch would be the correct answer and watch a few thousand three two thousand three well All right guys and at that yeah that was a great I Believe it [laughter] I Believe Abe Lincoln was celebrating his ... and yet at that\nTime but that's the last time the browns won in Pittsburgh total dominance a but we got more on the browns later on because that's getting real fun\nAs getting real fun there and Cleveland All right thanks Dave uh we're coming to life and the guy told Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would guy go\nGo to guy could comical eight under nine four seven out of the only heard part figuring out which way is easier by the way did Abe Lincoln actually have a ... that I just recklessly said on the air you just regular says I don't hear well don't tell them I said okay now I don't wanna piss me off\nCourse courts I ... a lot of scores were you okay um so are we are uh so uh coming up in about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio I think\nI think somebody ... missed an opportunity to do one of the all time great things in a recent broadcasting history okay one of the all time great things I think they missed an opportunity in that and I'll explain what that is about ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio so we have got\nSaints Vikings and one of the matchups that I've been looking forward to um as much as any game all year long saints and Vikings the saints have actually scored a so we're early in the first quarter\nA New Orleans where they seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings ah the touch down for a New Orleans was I Believe Alvin Kamara a album Kamara on a toss from\nDrew Brees I Believe they're counting that as a touchdown pass for you fantasy football players out there who have been job to buy ladder roles and flips and tosses and all of that but the New Orleans saints heavy seven nothing lead over the Minnesota Vikings and we will keep you up to date on that moving through out but I look at the saints\nAnd the saints have won five in a row outside of the first loss of the season and everybody gets tripped up the first last of the CBC great teams lose the first week of the season all the time you know ... you don't know what the game plan for you don't know anything the saints have won every single game sense and so New Orleans has almost quietly\nBecome one of the better teams not only in the NFC but in the NFL and Minnesota and you give them all the credit in the world after that Thursday night game against the rams a few weeks back Minnesota\nHas rallied strung together some wins they're starting to get a little bit healthier Everson Griffin are dealing with his a mental health issues is coming back\nAdam stealing or maybe the best receiver and football he's been dominant um they still are dealing with some injuries often supplying a running back down and cooks been banged up a couple of the injuries on defense but you can't deny Kirk Cousins up to this point has lived up to his contract\nYou cannot like the guy you can think that uh you can hate to use like that crap or you can think that the Redskins made a a great decision by letting him go you can think he's overpaid you could think he's not an elite quarterback he doesn't deserve that kind of guaranteed money no doubt about it ... cousins has been\nA fantastic addition to the Minnesota Vikings and if they don't advance or don't get it done this season in the NFL it's not going to be because of her cousins he's been awesome\nBut the reason that this game as sentimental to this show is because we were on the air when one of the all time great plays in NFL playoff history went down to ... and I were doing the show last January\nAnd while we were on the air the game was happening and so of course it's a live game and it's a playoff game when we've got to pay our respects to it and so we're doing we can't really do play by play because that's not legal\nAnd we can't really you know delve into broadcast on the radio side of things so that's not legal so we did our best to kind of paint the picture for ya I feel like I did a a pretty good job as a professional broadcaster I feel like I did\nI assumed Brady could hold up his end of the bargain since the guy does college football and the NFL for Fox\nSo ... that Brady Quinn a broadcasting professional part of one of the top teams with Fox that you see every single weekend on your TV I assumed that he can handle the responsibility as well to oh here's how it sounded last January\nAs a warning to time element you know ten seconds but through the pass rush right now I mean the saints are really getting after this office of why for the Vikings\nAs stupid I mean the the the crummy part about all this has Minnesota and we're just going to crack jokes and bus balls while there's a team was playoff fate is on the line as case it was back to throw a going deep right side and uh oh my God he caught it step on\nDigs you and the game is over Stefan gigs just scored on ... on bully [laughter]\nAnd the biking\nJust won the game ... like it's like somebody like somebody gave their ... I got ...\nKilos math and told him to bark at the neighbors that you're already told you played at that lab but mine that's the guy who's never smoked a cigarette in his life breathing I've joked about him and I have never smoked a cigarette in our life\nNever never ... ... and I asked myself okay if you never smoked a cigarette why how do you sound like that and and I will I Will get I if he's in the elements you know if he's like in and I did a rod race and he's in Alaska hanging out and some ... doing the show\nOr he's on the side of the movie alive trying to decide which one of the victims in the plane crash he wants to eat I get it look your voice is hoarse I understand it\nThe guy leaves an ethics South Florida\nHow was that voice\nBut I don't understand it do they say it'll get\nIt and we're really looking forward to to reliving that moment with ... but he decided to stick you as a listener and say I'm not coming in so unfortunately he's not going to be here\nAre Jonah socks Fox Sports radio the Vikings out the ball back a nine and a half minutes to go first quarter the saint of the seven nothing lead read Scott Red Sox are leading the Dodgers two to one end of the first inning a Dodger Stadium um as we can be alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nWhen we come back somebody missed an opportunity\nTo pull off one of the all time great stunts in broadcasting history I'll tell you who that is next year in office are\nBased Fox Sports radio\nAnd wearing shorts and I've found\nNow normally I Would reach out for a guest a but we can't even get Steve the sacred to come on the show and he's our update anchor and we can't even get Brady to show up and he co hosts the show with me so we've got our selves an actual broadcaster with us his name is David gas gone I you know is the gas man\nDave Dave I'm dead guy first okay that satellite first of all Dave\nCould you pull that off as a broadcaster yes okay but what a pain in the ass right\nIt is in fact distance from the coliseum Chavez Ravine is six point three miles and normally if you're like in the Midwest or maybe down south it'll take ten Fifteen minutes yeah\nRight now according to map quest it'll take you thirty five minutes of ... six point three miles from the coliseum to Chavez Ravine does that taking the streets or the freeway at the freeway that still\nWrong that's probably taken a helicopter at the door on um yeah yeah it's it's a it's a brutal man and look there are people that work here that will leave games at the coliseum and out was how far away the Fox sports radio studios at the coliseum or how far how like no traffic what's the drive\nNo traffic if I leave my house and make it hearing about maybe\nTwenty eight thirty two minute yeah I've heard Ninety minutes following games that's how long borrowing game yeah ...
