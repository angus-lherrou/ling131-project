took sixty three to point shots you know and so\nI get so long to point or just a foot or two inside the three point line you probably shouldn't be taking no shot\nBut if you're talking about Egypt

fortunately they have Josh hater you mentioned a little tidbits instead how 'bout this one for the all star left to use seems to strike out\nEvery other batter he's ever faced in his life\nHe's gone at least two innings this year\nTwenty three times for the brewers Milwaukee's record is twenty three and oh when he pitches at least to an age and in fact he set an all time major league record for most strike outs by a lefty reliever this year for one season in fact over half the bats against him ended in strike out this year\nAnd he's been dominant in the postseason as well he threes nasty man it's like Randy Johnson coming out of the bullpen and the early anybody\nOn the sloppy hair going ... got the floppy do\nCan't see the ball coming out of its hands and they blew me away on its by\nLA to one and the top of the fifth at Milwaukee and the good news for the brewers fan says that hate her through under twenty pitches and his first two wedding so he's certainly going where the two weddings and this one\nWe mentioned last a hour on the show about Manny Machado was bon single which is the play of the game so far on a three to pitch a ... single safe at first and the next batter homers\nThat's why the Dodgers are up to one and this game\nAnd we I think all concluded that there is no way that's happening unless the crowd wasn't writing them so badly with all the booming last night and tonight in fact much autos ... single tonight\nWas the first bond hit in the majors on a three to pitch in four years\nAnd then his home to first time was under four seconds\nWhich is his fast is running to first base of the entire year so you can call him Johnny hustle when he's actually motivated by the visiting fans I guess Alex ... has been throwing in the bullpen for LA\nClinton ... is in the bullpen and expected to come on in relief for the Dodgers at some point tonight he has come on the last two postseason in deciding game series so looking ahead the game's only top of the

save your on your own you know he's from ... from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy go dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven auto dealing hard part figuring out which way is easier it's crazy what Steve alluded to do\nWith a Machado saying that he's not Johnny hostile like\nOf all the things I Would not want to be known for I Would not ever want to be known as a person who doesn't give effort was lazy oh my God I like the Brian ... yeah oh if you could say that about me I Would be I'd be absolutely beside myself\nYou know why because that's the one thing you can control right yeah like yeah can't control if you're better than someone over if you're a faster if you get you can control whether you out and work them that's right or work in general are period ever and one thing you asked role is your effort\nAnd then if you're the one putting the message out there just wasn't like somebody else said yeah many Machado is not exactly Johnny hostile and he would just not take exception to it he's the one who said that about him some\nGuys I'm lazy so hey you know I'm not going to just give it is only ... time did your expectations by uh\nThat that plays off [laughter]\nIt's a hard thing to me it's hard to take plays off in baseball because [noise]\nGo list so few action points\nIn a game where were you when did you play golf you mean yeah between not having to do anything anyway\nRight that's right like of all sports you write great point of all sports to take some plays off or not give maximum effort you have no excuse for the sports be baseball done none\nVisit football where you're a defensive linemen and it was a fourteen play drive it on second in seven you kind of took the play off the euro shortstop okay like you weren't huffing and puffing you didn't run a mile when you were on the field and now you gonna run to first base and you're not going to do\nThat come on come on you but then it ought to haul game [laughter] do enough to know all about like when you have a chance to\nDo something you should go crazy like usually so hell\nBent on any type of action that you put in maximum effort over effort\nRight yeah\nTotally that should be the case by the way speaking of putting in an effort\nHow about Michigan linebacker Devon Bush before the game begins to Michigan State did you see that reaches carving up\nThe logo at midfield hurt just didn't like the Michigan State\nThey were about ten minutes late in pre game warm ups the tradition they have they lock arms and they walk across the entire field as a team in Michigan was out there they're warming up and so Michigan State just walking through these Michigan players and so ... Bush had an issue with it\nAnd he's taking his cleats in just absolutely\nYou only see replace your David the morale right he was creating dip it's at midfield [laughter] it's tough in all over the sporty logo I got to admit I kinda liked it\nI I Know it was Bush no pun intended it was Bush league Bush I like that as long as you back it up and it's all good back it up\nWhat did you think about that about ... midfield you're\nGoing to hell of a rivalry know what that means yeah you\nKnow you you late where out who warming up you want to walk through us okay I've got something for you\nYeah and I like I always say that it was before the game\nThere were sixteen minutes we're Michigan State could have taken out their frustration right on Devon Bush in Michigan it's a lot different than Baker Mayfield planting a flag it midfield after the game I just wasn't my cup of tea because there's nothing the other team could do All right you would do it already\nOkay All right so in terms of the Lakers only ask you this Laker fan former athlete he from salon do you think that LeBron deep down believes that the Lakers are capable of winning a championship this year\nI think he believes it as much as he thought that that Cleveland team last year could win a championship\nReally yeah\nSo this year's Lakers squad but once they leave they don't want ... if you believe you're the greatest player on the planet earth right you believe you can do ... Sherry it yeah [laughter]\nThat's how would you can't speak you're the greatest player and not have that type of belief it doesn't work it they don't go together I\nTotally hear you but even being the greatest basketball\nPlayer hand say realistic because that's not realistic like people who consider themselves the greatest\nAt something a number one don't have realistic thoughts running through their mind like mere mortals right but realistically I shouldn't even be ... that doesn't happen it's like if there's a ball in my hand is time on the clock we got a shot we got action we got action [laughter]\nRight and that's the mentality so you can you give them into an argument with someone who consider themselves the greatest is you basically arguing with yourself right there's nothing you can say is knows that line there's no\nUh analytics you can point out to them that it's going to prove them wrong I ... I Believe they have the ability to affect the outcome personally\nRight but you know as well as I Do even in the NBA it's a team game yeah you're talking about going up against the warriors who and boogie cousins it's healthy they're going to have five all stars and they're starting five\nAnd you're looking at what Brian this is after the blazers game and look the blazers they play great at home they've crushed the Lakers were sixteen straight times you know so it's not like oh they're going to be a disaster they lost on the road in the opener against the blazers it's nothing like that but the way the game went\nAnd when you don't have shooters when you have a collection of ball handlers around LeBron\nHe knows what he's up against what the warriors so he has all the confidence in his own abilities but do you believe he's got confidence in his teammates abilities to the point where he thinks it's a realistic possibility that they won the championship\nI think he has more confidence in this group of guys had a group in in um in Cleveland yeah well the fact that they were able to do what they did him in position to win game one of the finals which would have changed everything\nI I I yeah I I I Believe so I really do\nYou might be right you might be I just wonder you know and it could be at some point during the season early on where it's the home opener tonight against the rocket let's say the Lakers don't win it and let's say that\nSome of his teammates the role players in big moments they just\nThey wet themselves more they don't come through I'm Wondering if there's one moment and I would have to imagine there is that there's a little bit of doubt that creeps in in LeBron says ... probably not going to win a title the season\nI Can't imagine he has the road doubt all year long with this collection of guys on the roster\n... we know what he does if there's no doubt he goes to management says hey we need to make changes\nMhm right so that's what he would do and that they would be receptive to that\nThey would I Wonder if one of those requests it's going to be a new head coach I Wonder this year if it's going to work out for Luke Walton 'cause that that might be on the ...\nWe'll see how it looks are coming up next the guy go studios to very bold moves that are paying off quite an similarly [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them\nIf you own a fifty year old male maybe a bit\nPorgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month called term providers speak with big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight big Lew will find a term my policy for you even if you have type ... diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure\nTerm provider has helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life insurance\nTo buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is called big Lu at eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... will make sure the scales are tipped in your favor\nGall eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight ... we'll answer your call and worked at the window a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose like you he's on meds to call I ate hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight eight hundred seven hundred sixty eight Ninety eight\nThe Gulf Coast news traffic and weather station news talk one oh four nine W.

to say Steve this eggers not one of those men and I love\nThe oddity is wild Vin Scully was on the air in recent years the angels TV announcer purposely would not tell the audience sit there with no hitter being pitched because he thought it would jinx it I'm not kidding you\nTalk about minor leagues Dodgers leading five one at Milwaukee in the bottom of the seventh game seven of the NFC yes it's on at fast one right now rookie Walker viewer pitched into the fifth inning as the Dodgers starter\nJulie's just seen was taken out after two weddings as Milwaukee starter Christian yell at you hit a solo home or in the first nearly had the timing RBI and the fifth inning instead LA left fielder Chris Taylor with a sliding catch on the warning track to end the ending\nPreserve the lead and then on top of the six ... with a three run Homer Chris Taylor's defense by the way he's not an outfielder they had to teach him outfield in the past couple of years just to get 'em in the light up he's an infielder\nAnd the Dodgers are three innings away from a World Series appearance the world series starts in Boston Tuesday nights on Fox TV will city has one of the city [laughter]\nOn Fox TV by the way quite the college football game tonight and incredible for his staff at twenty fifth rank Washington state leading at the break twenty seven nothing over twelve ranked Oregon they dominated them

S. U. was one of the top four teams in the nation [noise] ooh I mean that's big time right\nThere I was big ... big win last week and then they get they carrying it over a man\nAnd they apple pie week and then they're going to take on Alabama so it could change it all can change boy yeah this point to where they are I\nRemember last week you know we talked bottom and how this can propelled them a moving forward\nAnd um it's it's it's\nYou get shaken out to be that type of do no journal they'd go beat Alabama and a couple of weeks\nOh man we know the ashes you [laughter] you're ... you're right yeah but to take down Georgia who was in the national championship game last year it would be where they are using\nThree ranked teams in rural yep Florida Georgia Mississippi State mhm\nTune in one of those games and the next game will be gives number one Alabama yeah have you on your resume to hold up and you want to have an opportunity to be in that conversation for uh\nThe the ... the college you know championship then you need to win the game yeah very got to\nDo it got to because you're right you can't expect to be a two last team do you have no chance because you're in the same division as Alabama right do you dropped his game the dream is dead [laughter]\nI'm ... yoked yoga in both ...\nAnd I'll tell you this the uniforms that they wore today is really cool because the helmets they changed color based on the light so it went from like purple gold it really awesome but the thing is this was to commemorate the one hundred year from the silent season in Nineteen Eighteen\nSo there was a video that Lsu football put out on Twitter that was awesome I encourage you to try to find it I'll retweeted in case you haven't seen it\nI'm at the no show but it says a hundred years ago Lsu football players hung up their cleats for a greater cause many students and faculty left to serve their country in World War one wow like for people in twenty eight teen I don't think you can even wrap your mind around that\nJust literally stink\nImagine like you're at Fox Sports radio right now he from imagine if some of the bosses were like hey I'm not going to be here\nI'm going to go fight the war [laughter] you know you can't even really begin to process that but for LSU to pay tribute to those people who fought in World War one I thought that was awesome\nYeah that's amazing yeah I Am thank you absolutely you know ... we need to do with it so\nIt was important for us to get a W and it was a much bigger\n[laughter] pretty important\nOf a must win it they have it you know yeah uh we got actually in the baseball game as well where the Milwaukee Brewers trying to make a little bit of noise two outs bottom of the seven to run run first base still a lot of\nActually without working out all year round\nSorry sorry to give you all through as having nightmares induced by this conversation but we are able to be telling a story and\nThen I have a little deeper I yeah I hear ya yeah\nBut it's the same thing with the Lakers you got to know what you are and what you are you are not the rockets in a three point shooting team with any great\nPercentage going on there your team they can't shoot very well from the outside so don't dig yourself into a back yourself into a corner by shooting a ton of them right\nSorry about that song thing\nYeah I Can't I don't know if I won't be able to let that go to night yeah sorry about that they already got out of my head so bad weight in show I Apologize for that apologize\nBy the way\nNot one of the bigger games or the day but I got my eye on this Texans jaguars game mhm because you look at the jags they make a trade and pick up Carlos Hyde for a fifth round or former Brown's running back\nAnd it makes me think good lord do they have any trust in Leonard for net to stay healthy at this point or get healthy at\nThis point right he introduced hamstring in week one he came back and weak for for a little bit re injured it it's going to be his fifth game that he misses this season he's a great running back but he just can not get on the field man\nYou know hamstrings recipe for running backs a those difficult injuries\nBecause ... you never know why one could be a more severe than the other and all it takes is to aggravated just to have a huge step back yeah\nHow about this Sunday night game bangles at the chiefs I Know the chiefs all world off then everybody loves them all this stuff their defense is a smoldering piled his\nOff good graces is so bad in the bangles they could score points men you know

he got them now yeah that's pretty good right\nI like that but um yeah I mean right or if or if we can find the cut of ... are actually ripping dad Tony wait to hear this because he takes a big shot at it if you could tell there's a lot of animosity between those two you know\nAbsolutely and and it's funny because this has been\nI'm kind of really one sided rivalry I mean I Know you and I you know we love college football and for years Michigan just absolutely dominated Michigan State and really since uh since day in Tony got things rolling Antonio I get the Antonio Antonio ...\nI'm sixty Antonio got things rolling down there it's been really one sided in but it's ... it's one where it seems like there's genuine bad blood some of these\nReserves respect but I think Michigan State still feels like they're the second kind of program in that state trying to earn that respect the Antonio allows his players to to what I thought it was kind of a silly thing to do that during the warm ups in our book comes right back at them and it seems like there is some bad blood or go into the rest of the season\nAs for the game I thought Michigan was dominating at least in the first half\nAn inch should have been up more than seven nothing besides fuel goals are missed opportunities next thing you don't Michigan State ties up at seven they have all the momentum and I'm thinking as Michigan going to let this would slip through their fingers going to be tough on the road or none of course they get the long touchdown\nA big break their goal fourteen seven what a Twenty one seven\nMonster victory in this one horrible game from Michigan State will work yeah did you what you have like five ... ... they could move the ball great defense of effort by Michigan I'm just a mobster victory every which\nWay around there and yeah I don't want to look too far ahead but let me ask you Arnie I I Know the games in Columbus but if you used to her article Asian course I think Michigan is a better team right now\nAnd we all everybody gave up on Michigan early in the year after that Notre Dame game but I kinda just referenced it the right that a Notre Dame looks a lot better I don't know where you stand but I think Michigan is a significantly better team right\nNow I think they're better much better obviously defense of here I may yeah there's much better defensively but I think ... states the better off fence of team and\nUm you know after ... wins a game like that well they usually say defense but when you have enough it's like Ohio State and I noticed in show against Purdue I'm not so sure that that Michigan the overwhelming favorite and that when like you're making them out to\nBe era yeah I don't know about overwhelming but you know the Ohio State thing you know they're gonna have to get things cleaned up their their only ranked fifty second nationally in rushing um and that is going to be a lot lot lot worse after today\nThey ... they got to figure out a way to be more than one dimensional I mean look we're watching the game right now already they're getting him ... pretty much just had a safety there uh uh you know I mean they're getting ...\nOhio State with all those five star guys that they recruited are getting dominated at the line of scrimmage it happened last week as Minnesota it's happening again today\nI'll say this I Know they got smoked by Iowa will last year this is about as embarrassing as it comes for Ohio State\nNow I Know people are screaming at me right now but what about after the game if you're going to go ahead and rip Michigan State for their shenanigans before the game what about after the gate when Michigan celebrated it midfield jumping up and down I didn't hear horror by complaining about that now did he was all you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander air and you know what I mean\nWas it was it a little revenge for for ... maybe they will be wars when did you think of course maybe they would have been a little more respectful at Michigan State had been a little more respect for I'm just saying you know\nIs that the way to do it though if they just respect us we'll come back to disrespect them and start stomping on I mean because that can cause the riot I could I could achieve Michigan State come running out and you know all of a sudden there's there's this the cubs going on you know\nListen I mean if if I'm doing my show prep here and you walk by and you just close line me I'm coming after you after I'd do a good show that's arms saying\nAll right if you want to get a hold

I I mean Clemens in whoever it would be and I said LSU it obviously one of the LSU I guess in theory it could be LSU ... probably very very unlikely\nBut it's just really hard to find a team that that is going to to be able to challenge them and I think the biggest difference this year as we've discussed over the last eight weeks\nThey're getting great quarterback play and they've always been great on defense now they have the number one off at the college football they seem absolutely unbeatable um it it's just amazing to watch weekend in week out I mean you know Tennessee coming off a win over ranked team on the road they beat they want to add all burned and\nThey're down whatever it was twenty eight to nothing about eight minutes into the game was unbelievable to watch\nAll right we'll finish up all the other top twenty five a lot of action going on a couple of games still going on also so we'll check the scores on that first though let's check in with the savior see what's out there what's going on to say\nSomehow the Dodgers are going to the world series they take game seven on fs one plane going on right now too late on the bandwagon already championship series is over\nThe Dodgers when a top seed Milwaukee tonight five to one ... with the key three run Homer in the sixth inning he had three hits Clinton ... comes out of the pen\nFor the safe or not technically essay but getting the last three outs as he had done out of the bullpen in the last two postseason in deciding games he pitches effectively\nAlways had to get us look at that\nI'm saying it has happened to me like three years in a row including game seven of the world series last year and the clincher against the nationals the year before where he got to save this is a Dodger team that in mid may had a record of sixteen and twenty five they were already eight and a half games back in the division\nThey fought back and finish tied for first Indiana west won a tie breaker game with Walker buell or on the ... game one sixty three of the regular season and that got him home field advantage for the first round and now here on the road a game seven when to go to the world series in Boston for game on Tuesday night\nOn Fox TV and guys the stat amazing as it is it's still true\nWhen the Dodgers had a lead a four\nAt any point in any game they have always won this year the owner you pick of the world series Dodgers red socks on Red Sox won a hundred and eight are you kidding yeah wow [laughter] I mean the fake or anyone\nGames the red Sox a hundred and eight that light up is phenomenal and remember we're going to have a\nVote to borrow was in the division through relaxes\nI agree that some of the winds that's not all of the winter when we had the three games potentially three at Dodger Stadium next weekend JD Martinez the da and the peak Canada is going to have to be in the lineup so they're already talking about him playing out field and runs the defensive great ... maybe in the second base to get them both in the line up in\nAn earlier in the year once ... used to be a second baseman in the minor leagues but he looks a little shaky out there are a little bit\nOf Houston second baseman Jose all too they had knee surgery today the front runner for the reds manager's job is David Bell son a buddy bell according to Fox is John ... as for college football the night in college football is just about over and it includes the upset when of Perdue over a number to Ohio State\nForty nine to twenty wow also USC loses forty one twenty eight at Utah the Trojans are four and three and quarterback\nFreshmen star JT Daniels left in the second half within a parent concussion UCLA up in the late game ten nothing over Arizona in the second quarter of play earlier wins for Alabama and Clemson\nFor LSU Michigan and Oklahoma in the top ten and there is a night in the NBA as we have Lakers at home home opener losing ... while his forty seven forty six\nRockets lead mid second quarter in LA already earlier wins for Charlotte and Dallas\nBoy allowed to get through and one NFL no patriots tighten Rob Gronkowski did not make the trip to play the ... ankle and back injury so officially listed as doubtful right now\nRight thanks a lot to say good we're coming to you live from the Geico Fox Sports radio studios\nIt's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance with Geico\nOr just go to guy could come or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well let's figure out which way it's easier just for the F is for the sing off on the Dodgers Mike or tweets and\nYou guys are surprised that baseball manager over thinks up there I'm not baseball managers over think decisions more than anyone\nOther than maybe an idiot coaches does a pass on first goal from the ... had a raider nation has tag Seahawks they should that's Mike out there um\nYou know I look he felt comfortable upbringing ... does it make a difference it got the job done they're going to the world series or nobody's going to talk about that but what a great world series we're gonna have ratings through the roof exactly what it will be needed Dodgers and Red Sox are great is that\nIt is how about the fact by the way as much as you and I've just spent the last probably what four or five ten minutes crushing Dave Roberts the guy that's basically responsible for the red Sox bracing breaking that eighty six year cursed Dave Roberts with that stolen base in two thousand four now managing the opposing team I like that\nOn bowl we look at you look at me about this stuff\nUp baseball ... I'm a regular evil people might governments or whoever\nChocolate or whoever oh let's go through the rest of the top twenty five just a little quick notes on each game you make a little comment um let's get back to Ohio State they lose forty nights when the\nUh that is a fight or Haskins threw the ball Seventy three times I'm sure that wasn't the game plan for during seven yards two touchdowns they get clobbered Purdue\nTwenty eight points in the fourth quarter they would've forty nine twenty this will drop Ohio State I'm not going to stay out of the top ten but probably the number eight I'm debating if they're going to be out of Texas are not\nA good look when you lose a forty nine twenty that's a hell of a lot of points that we always question that defense for Ohio State now we see is the true meaning of them right now\nYeah by the way last segment remember Arnie you mentioned why is Alabama so much better than everybody else I don't know what the answer is but if we agree that nicks that urban Meyer is universally the second best coach in college football how about this that that your boy air tourist just pulled up\nNick Saban hasn't lost to an ... ranked opponent since two thousand seven wow eighty straight games this is now the second year in a row that Ohio State has lost by twenty five plus she went on ranked opponent last year\nI Would this how many games I'm going to games eighty straight Arnie or do you still had hair on the top of your head less time saving lawsuit on right to own\nThat is unbelievable so you're saying it's all said and why their head and shoulders better than everybody else\nThat it is and you know what's amazing to about saving I was thinking about 'cause when you pitched you know we've talked about this on on other shows but I was thinking about this he loses assistant coaches every year to I mean he lost Kirby Smart a few years ago he lost lane kissing a few years ago he lost Jeremy ... the guy that he faced with Tennessee today\nIt's the guy just keep losing assistant coaches he keeps us employers and he keeps on winning it's incredible I Know you're asking about Ohio State but I thought that was kind of a fitting kind of thing to bring full circle\nI Want you to know something well everybody was watching the Dodgers go to the world series well everybody watched um Ohio State lose while everybody's watching LeBron season opener in Los Angeles\nFor some silly reason I'm like why can't I just ... we've well enough alone just enjoy again but no I have to put on the Arizona game at the same exact time wherever zone is running for a long touchdown and they fumble at the five yard line and they ... to the end zone\nI are running on you know just just for a touchdown nobody around them they would have to be a zone but nobody can make reforms numbers nobody's watching that one you know what I'm saying yeah I live about\nFive minutes from the rose bowl I think I Need a a clothes hangar to put on one of these TV to get that game on on the TV here 'cause nobody has watched\nAll by the way you be prepared to be ripped would you like to start with that with David who tweets on an errand tour as arm in arm disrespectful thought that was a sign of unity stinking genius said that the Michigan player stopped on the logo sounds disrespectful to me arm in Arbor stopping\nThe more post game stopping and ... comments not an eye for an eye at all\nUh well it started with the arm in arm thing it wasn't they didn't do that\nAs a retaliation for stopping on on the um none that happened after the game yeah I mean it started with Michigan State Michigan was out on the field in warm ups minding their own business preparing for the game\nMaybe by the way Michigan State should have been doing their own warm ups because they didn't they didn't do much once the game actually started to take that David wow yeah yeah you know\nI don't bring it was a lot of bad blood but but you know what a horrible for him to get all upset about it and then after the game his team does that how come nobody brought that up to him I don't know if anybody the media said well what about your team stop and I I'm not at your line\nYeah all I saw was that a he said it was Bush league or childish or whatever and mark Daytona ... basically said yeah well it wasn't it wasn't a big deal at all\nI just you know look I I'm all for good rivalry but when you get your butt kicked you just kinda got to take it you know and exactly that's all I'm saying\nAll right a couple of the games consumed with the forty one seven over NC State noticed that were just ignoring quantum troubled Lawrence and not one twenty six thirty nine over three hundred yards at a touchdown I'm Still not sure the third best team and now they're probably going to move up the number two unless somebody seems a jump up and I don't see that happening but\nI don't see them as the second best team in college football right now\nIt's uh what was that there were it was like the dorm I had last week with the radio station or by local station or do I err Red Sox are a game what was the game for ...\nYeah that's right yeah that's what we were the air the Kansas City Joe against the New England patriots what was that there was a game one that was a game one or two right now I was getting too I think it was game to yeah you know and I ... and ... and that was literally they were like right across the street from each other out there yeah so that was\nBecause the the baseball game got to start like an hour early and then the football game which is obviously the most important thing because it was ... patriots you've got an undefeated team coming in there so seem dilemma yeah\nRight but I'd be ... obviously Dodgers game as dawn everybody's now tuned in to see what's going on with the Lakers are not a good first have for abroad\nSo we'll see what he does but it does and I feel like a playoff game ever and it really does guys I I've you know I was like oh my goodness I got to make sure I have another point in the rockets were problems first game I mean I I was excited about this excited for a regular season game Aaron\nYeah I was into the trailblazers game the other night to when when LeBron opened up I mean look there there is definitely a it is created a you know I think just to a new storyline I think it's good I mean that's the thing about the NBA right is that\nWe all know or I think we all know who's going to win this league again it's the warriors I think there are painfully boring but at least ... at least there's some buzz in at least there's some excitement and I will say this I Do think the Lakers it'd be really really interesting this year with those young guys with ...\nWith some of those vets that you know what what is a nice way say there are a little quirky I guess it would be and I say I like ah I think you know at least be entertaining here over the next couple of months\nI let's just finished a couple of games in the top twenty five Oklahoma which was up I think twenty eight seven I'm next thing you know it's close to half twenty twenty four and you're wondering if maybe Oklahoma what's this one slip through the fingers\nThat you wouldn't even that for going into the fourth but then they pull away fifty two twenty seven ...\nI'm a okay gate with the four touches but only a little bit over two hundred yards passing was Nineteen twenty nine I'm but I guess good victory by Oklahoma they'll just move up maybe a notch or two a week maybe a notch or two or because of the Ohio State Los\nYeah what a weird game or I don't know how close you watch this one I Know probably to poke your buddy cursed plank or you're probably watching it closely but uh\nNow what what what I think they're going to lose I'll watch it all at least I Know what I think they're going to win all move on to something else\nWas going to say it was a weird way because Oklahoma jumped out to this massive lead TCU makes a quarterback changed cuts the lead to twenty eight twenty four and half time as you mentioned and all of a sudden it's a game\nAnd then ... quarterback gets hurt and Oklahoma pulls away and it doesn't even look like it was close but it was close and interesting there for a while before Columbus pulled away\nI give a little love to your mythical are defending champion yeah a central Florida because you're you're we got to give them a little well got to give them or do we have to give them a little um I don't know\nWell there certainly better than Arizona I could tell you why are they better than ... Notre Dame is it like that well they do well I don't know I mean they'd be Auburn was yesterday champ last year they beat ...\n... yeah they go to Auburn last year I don't know but I'm just saying I mean like my whole thing is like I look I don't think\nThey're going to get in that I Know they won't get in as a matter of fact but I mean we're we're looking at a scenario it's almost certainly going to have to uh every team in the packed wolf has to last is probably every team in the ...\nBig twelve could potentially end up with two losses depending on what happened\nI'm just how many games in a row do they have to win before they get people's respect I'm not I'm not saying that they're Alabama I don't think anybody is what you tell me on a neutral field do you mean to tell me they can't maybe play with the LSU and Ohio State the way they look and I I don't know I just think they should be more in the conversation there\nI think a lot of people say we don't even want to give them a chance we don't even want to see him out there um but then they get ratings isn't what central Florida is all about I we're almost into our one in the books I mean we just crushed our number one almost all you want to get in air in on this score tour as a much thinking genius one\nSo send those in fast and furious what to do with our two here on Fox Sports\nRadio [noise]\nIt's been mother here everybody's got to do is drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea of what's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\n[noise] he's a monster from Stephen King and executive producers David Kelly and jak bender ...

yeah and it's hard to quantify who has the edge there you know I mean as far as the travel goes the professional athletes um is these guys are used the traveling granted you're changing times on you're going to another continent it's a little different than going from the east or west coast\nBut with that said it very difficult to quantify as far as this is how many points it's worth and which team really does have an advantage over the other\nUm with that said we've seen this line go up and down what I mean by that is it opens around six six and a half got fed up to seven\nAt seven you salt Tennessee money coming from some sharp\nAt six and a happy thought charge money from some sharp um so it seems like that's the right number um that that the books have up there the public's going to be on that the chargers so far they're already getting a lot chargers one sided\nUm money that's the obviously rarely rarely early games and it's going to be tied into a lot of later games meaning there'll be a lot of teenagers on the chargers and money line ... with later games the way the chargers just have to win this game pretty much straight up so that's what they can get mostly on that one\nUh books are going to be open Tennessee could keep it much closer than they did last week against Baltimore\nBiggest further before it let's go real quick a extra money coming in on the Lakers because of a bronze double the money triple the money nothing really more you told me\nI mean listen here's what's gonna happen like we see all the time that the market overreact\nUm and and you don't make money betting those teams that that everybody's jumping on especially early on in the season when you're paying a premium and that's exactly what you're saying with the LA Lakers win or lose your cashier ticket or not right now you are not getting the best of it that in that team\nThere's definitely a ... attack because they're getting volume and money from the public every night\nI Know I I was gonna say real quick I notice yeah Mary started is there money coming in on anyone other than the warriors or is there a hot pick right now with the other teams\nOn the way I look for in a way I I\nWouldn't say so somebody but sixty seven thousand dollars on the warriors just to make the playoffs the win six children\nSo that that's what you're getting exactly what you're getting and actually it's been a negative it really has because people aren't even wasting our money where what the NFL even last year when we had it was kind of historic that the patriots won and it said in such a favorite they when they when the season kicked\nOff they were down to around two or three to one\nUm favorite to win the super bowl that's unheard of prior to this season and even with them being that top heavy um there were still a ton of future money because people thought they're paid a bull but with Golden State that's where the problem lies\nThat the rest of the the teams aren't getting money that most think you're not feeding them you know maybe ... ... that second team a third team at the most maybe getting a little money but that said and I think that's been a negative more than a positive as far as MBA futures market the last few years with Golden State\nYou can get all the biggest one of the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com you can tweet them a Greek underscore

[noise] what about you know who's got it better than them I'll give you one\nIs it is Los Angeles between the rams the weight while the Lakers I was looking at right now and uh obviously the Dodgers\nWell as a sports fan I take advantage goes to Boston 'cause they've actually want something I listen why not I mean listen I mean I've been here in LA for ... I I moved here in twenty twelve some going on year six now almost two years seven\nThey haven't won a championship I mean the ... the patriots have one I think three Super Bowl since then the the the red Sox have won\nA World Series going for another one the Celtics are much improved by the way you know who who has a better than those guys who nobody can be anybody I got one for you how 'bout butch Jones dose\nJeez yeah yeah he got his age or a bad ... he's a he's\nA ... a former Tennessee coach yeah ain't getting paid by the way he's an analyst at Alabama which means he's basically a glorified intern but [laughter]\nHe's getting paid his by out of millions of dollars by Tennessee he returns to Tennessee is in Alabama analysts then gets a gain or a bath on the other side line while he's still getting checks from the exact same school that his team just be\nBy ... you should write an article about bad contracts I mean we always hear about the ... at one you know that oh yeah I'm and real quick I just got to stop and talk for just one second\nBecause a land Stevenson was taken down by the neck ooh ah and ah there was no tough all the players that kind of gather around I'm shocked I'm I'm absolutely shocked\nThat it didn't get into a subject a little bit more physical I I don't know if you're going to stop the game on was that when Steven said look like yeah yeah\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by painkillers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted them morphine and he for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my own James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ...\nThis is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public San says on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count\nBut the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um she would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight\nBut she doesn't have anything to do\nKnow and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work\nAnd so I'm going to go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the either letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you in the chair with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\n'em and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry

know he he's getting some heat but don't blame the loss on him that's for certain but yesterday when Ohio State lost Oklahoma did beat TCU fifty two twenty seven why bring that up\nBecause this this committee that we get it to all the time\nAnd they have the the committee with the top four teams obviously they compare comet opponents no Ohio State beat TCU forty twenty eight back to September Oklahoma beat the fifty two twenty seven yesterday so you don't Ohio State right now you know they have a neutral site when it gets that TCU they've got a road with a Penn State\nAnd they need to beat Michigan State on the tenth on November and obviously it all comes down probably to November twenty fourth with Michigan\nYeah mean Ohio State as ugly as it was last night and that's a that's a bad laws to get roll the way they did at her do but if they run the table like you said Andy if they take down Michigan State which is very possible Michigan State is not a very good football team\nAnd you win a home game against Michigan who's had all kinds of trouble against Ohio State you go to the Big Ten championship game if you win that Ohio state's got a legitimate resume and also you mentioned Oklahoma\nAnd Oklahoma they lose the red river rivalry against taxes but if they run the table and possibly be taxes in the big twelve championship game\nDepending on what happens in front of them they've got a legitimate shot they at least have a pulse for the playoffs right now at that age you know like a healthy pulse but it's still there you can still detect the polls from the sooner is right now\nBut I did tell you right now about the ... the top four I'd have Oklahoma fifth looking in Alabama as clear cut number one\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute how can you have Oklahoma ... in Texas the team\nBecause I had a business of Alabama one I have Clemson too\nI have Notre Dame three uh-huh have Michigan for Michigan for\nThen why you have Michigan leapfrogging LSU\nBecause I just don't trust the LSU office I think their office right now and I understand and and obviously I Want to see what they do it down the road they still have a couple of more games to play but I I just think that office right now but\nThis is the I test I'm going to be like the committee I Know that I cry it's the I asked\nWhere was the I test when they're smack it around the number two ranked Georgia Bulldogs at the time by twenty points the other week where was that that\nThat's why have George it down to separate the race I I don't trust Georgia, Georgia was a fraud I don't think they were there oh wow I bet I test is is a great great area but people like me or the committee to use as a crutch you know you have an excuse why they test I test really it's terrible\nYou you gotta go by resume screw the I test All right I'm going to print out T shirts that said that screw\nThe I test goal by who they played in who they beat\nAnd LSU is resume is more impressive than Michigan's resume in terms of who they played who they beat right now who's the number two ranked team that Michigan took down on their schedule huh your weight around Michigan or SMU it's starting to branch out and go\nSo LSU do the windows of Miami is not as impressive now as it was then they beat all burn okay they'd be Georgia which I don't think there's that oppressive either and they found is that\nHow how would that that impressive they put them down and that was a whisker away from winning it\nAll last year there are number two ranked in the nation and they smack 'em

I I like the ... at home if the game was in New England and I have a different opinion but yes ... and the bed we'll we'll see how bad it is today but they are going to put a lot of pressure and that's the game plan I gotta believe put pressure on Tom Brady get them out of the pocket make them rush that she's got to do\nWell the patriots you know the Sandy they're so smart you saw him last week Rob ... was a block or most of the game it was amazing because\nHe had three catches for just under a hundred yards but he had one catch for sixteen yards\nUntil the very end of the game because he was in there helping to pass protect for Tom Brady keep them keep them clean\nYou know so if you look at today's game I Would expect them to do something similar here you're they're going to use Dwayne Allen or they're tied and filling in for Rob Gronkowski he's read either as a blocker or what you're going to see you're going to see a heavy dose of James White catching the ball out of the backfield\nRight because they understand what it means present they understand what the bears defense\nPresent to them and they're going to counter it they're not going to sit there and play into their hand and say\nAll right let's just do a bunch of seven step drops Levi let's go a empty backfield let's go five white out we'll just have Tom Brady fend for himself back there they're going to be smart about that so I think you're going to see a lot of quick stuff a lot of passes to James White and you're going to see the patriots by design invite scheme\nHelp keep Tom Brady clean instead of playing into the bears Hans\n... and what you're basically saying right now you're talking about the experience against the novice that's basically what we're going to see today you but as she experienced paying off as far as the patriots game plan what these pros do how they handle it\nHow they how they go one on one against the bears were the best right now to them this is one of the bigger games on their schedule right now and you may see some young\nMistakes with these younger players that that's normally what happens I mean you know a bad snap here uh all sides here delay a game that's what happens you have a young team facing a big opponent and they can handle that kind of pressure\nYeah and look candy it's any given Sunday you know I'm not going to act as if the patriots have no chance to lose this game of course there's a legitimate chance the bears get the better of them today\nBut last week was uh oh that's right where the bears you know when you start buying in and you're like hey this he might win the NFC North\nAll of a sudden they lay in the egg on the road against Brock ... company what is that the dolphins were running wild not just the running game but Albert Wilson was running around like it was flag football last week was insane with the bears defense was doing\nSo I had to build up the ... yeah yeah I don't see how the bears against the dolphins look that decrepit\nAnd then come back to Chicago they're playing the patriots at home and all of a sudden their lights out I think that they still struggle if the dolphins get the better of the bears to the tune that they did last week to that degree I just don't see how the patriots are completely struggling all day today I don't see it\nFirst of all does anyone even remember her first Super Bowl ad\nYou guys remember it I don't I don't remember it I don't know anyone you know none of them but no I didn't know OK well anyway but the NFL the networks they've done a better job of minimizing the the uh the coverage of the national\nAnthem but the protesting players are protesting doesn't feel a little bit late here that you may be doing this six eight months away I agree with that much it's a little late here feels like it's kind of what we can kind of move past this little bit [noise]\nTake it all the ... well you take care of him I yeah I think he said it best time to boot breaking pass to know what's going to know what's going to miss Amy Schumer if she died around for the super bowl that's all I'm saying over that party she's a little late to the party and what they're dealing\nFeels about six months ago she said that because I mean now there's only about three or four players well done this right they've only nailed the coverage that they're not showing it so it feels like we move past is the NFL is back\nThe whole way way way to get all like All right well we're going to go away from this year\nAll right um college football rivalries you got to love them you gotta love 'em real resentment and emotion expressed by these plants\nWe'd love at Michigan Michigan State they were more they tested they don't flat out belligerent tone each other on Saturday both sides claim massive disrespect we all kinds of stuff we saw that Bush can wipe in his cleats on the spot and logo\nWe saw the coaches are trading what are the kids say I said what was your guys his favorite part about top Michigan State Michigan or disrespect back in part [noise] there's a lot\nI don't know why what was going to be a lot of that it has a lot of freaking layers over there [noise] my favorite part the on the line back\nOr just going crazy yeah you're on the most yet that Bush going nuts over there on the uh the body logo at ... field and I'll tell you what [noise] for mark said Tony oh to not have any cuts whatsoever he was sitting there smiling and Jim Harbach called them out and he said it would be I\nThink it's called the the cameras they these days what they told you how can you sit there they'd be at stake\nOh and\nThat really should get players maybe that's a good thing for markets O'Hare\nOkay half okay well we're going to move past that but we'll move more after that ... I'm not just\nAny time you know I'm a ... a day and the way to middle one which I I didn't know that the Michigan State players they line up like riot police\nAnd walk across the field before the game I saw that coming at me and they're going to be closed why me I'd be a little or does that mean Bush wiping its feet on the logo listen that greed deepest ticked off he's saying do maybe he'll do his wife\nIn the ... on the logo you can't do that is going to be able to pay for all right with that All right um what the deal with Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale All right he missed game by mail fiesta said taking his belly button and bring in and out of his question gave him a rash\nAnd he was unable to pitch I don't know what to making this guy is he putting us on for his own personal amusement I don't think\nHe's put there by the by the basically like gay that he was going to do that he delivered it very well maybe it'll be heavy on the silver screen at some point over here but I don't buy it I Need proof I think he's polling I'll let you go on\nOne I think he's got to put a good writer he's got a pretty good right is it really I don't think he's got a belly button bring out that\nLike I said okay well that brings me the second question to popping belly button rings on foods acceptable or no bleeping why do the leaf break it up on our next step all know acceptable I find out\nThen I take it out and I want to ask I better take you out and they listen to last year the drama of a motley crow Tommy late and you got fifty other things I don't know about it I don't get out of stuck it out doing it right now I'm like well you don't wash that they don't want to get an infection alright a lasting yeah\nBut you know stuck stuck tonight is celebrating the birthday my book was hurting but then when it goes\nAnd then my knees heartening Andy your oldest ... how do you manage all these like ... and ... it's called ... it's called the worst [laughter] hurry fix hurting all the time at built Danny Kaye gets mad bill in your diet over there right\nDrink it was you know which are like oh gee\nIf you suffer from if you suffer from E.

Fox\nNews\nFrom the men don't view it GMC studios he's loose talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\n[noise]\nFox Sports trend being\nIt was James seven in Milwaukee the brewers leaving one nothing with last season's rookie of the year as it is just seen\nTo colds or one in five you think he'd be getting criticized a little bit more about patch terminal with this one in five record but I've got one hundred million dollar contract he's going to be getting blasted a lot more that just the way it is\nBut a point this is a group of people knew that team was six and ten a year ago is not he's not going to turn it around overnight\nAnd they have ... giving crude and the benefit of the doubt\nThey have do you think he's getting he's not much heat which oh are you getting our kids all\nIt is that you hear with ... with Andy group with John brutal heat heat heat this guy this guy ... why would he tried to live back why this why that I tell you that disaster away by it's All right is he got his way to bring in Kevin figures because he's a big time raiders fan\nOkay we should have for the trade of of not that I had like but not getting the one last record all they do you get a ... do you turn on sports talk radio come on I don't think it's getting that much I don't think about that in that much really vague tape it\nJohn crude and gotten heat or not this\nYou're for the one in five record\nOh plenty of it plenty of heat\nThe heat no doubt that hundred million dollars in everything he does is that because of the hundred million dollars he gets but they know if you're a fan you know they weren't going anywhere this year this there was just a year ago now without Mac they weren't going anywhere correct\nDo you think that's what people were saying before the season\nOr they hold most people thought that there would at least be competitive I thought it'd be unreal is is I think there are going to win twelve games like they didn't try sixteen but if you were to say I think the rate is can possibly compete in the AFC West than have a chance\nTo get a playoff berth in the last month of the season I don't think that's unrealistic of Mac was still there yeah no ... and things were quick and the way they thought it\nWas the fact that there's there's no doubt money is I I don't know ... for the giants he's getting heat without even knowing how much money he makes but the point is that maybe they expect anything in New York anyway they will they were paid last year and they may be worse this year but you know money is a factor but getting\nBack to ... I mean they're supposed to be ... even if they don't if they had a woman coaching if they had no one coaching supposed to be Michigan State ... arch rival school on their schedule right agree on that\nAh no Ohio State has their arch rival but listening or Michigan State is a big time rival they've got a couple you can have a couple\nBut I Would have Ohio State above\nThe Michigan State rivalry is going to be a brawl on the twenty fourth a November I oh yeah but here's the thing man with with Jim harbor even if he runs the table if they win eleven straight games if they beat Ohio State\nThat would be a big time accomplishment but that's what Jim Harbaugh was brought to Michigan to do you know there's no so I I don't think that you can go over the top throwing rose petals at its feet\nJust because the critics in the naysayers have had a field day crushing Jim Harbaugh for not doing what he was brought to ...\nMotel yeah it's too early to to give them the rose petals you're exactly right let's see November twenty fifth I might do it if he beats Ohio State and wants to table then we'll\nSee what happens in terms of the college football playoff where\nIf they win the Big Ten championship if they just run the table from here on out there going to have a really strong resume to overlook so we'll see if he can do it but make no mistake Andy that's what he was brought to Michigan to do and it shouldn't just be a love fest because they beat Michigan State who is not a good foot\nNo no I couldn't agree more and you know what that's what I read them I was brought to Ohio State to do and he's on his face yesterday at Purdue right that's what it was bought for so and I don't know how much money or bring my base I don't think they can ... but he's a good point about seven right\nHow are the main highlight that and he's ... right\nAnd that's what he's got a national championship and his back pocket that help like Jim ... has been no work Los that at Michigan so we'll see we'll see it could be two schools heading in opposite directions so that that's finale at the end of the season man with Michigan\nAt Ohio State and they've had some close games in the past two ... right there\nBut he's got to jump over that hurdle to get to anywhere significant there's no doubt about that\nRight and and if he doesn't get into the final four this year then I got to leave the heat will get even hotter\nIt really well because that's what they expect and certainly that's what he is that for whatever the reason I mean that doesn't make a difference how much money they made that that was my point I mean money is a factor and\nThe more money you make the more pressure is on you not from you internally but from you because of the outside sources like the media the the alumni and the fans that's where it comes from\nWell yeah I mean sure but it's too it's twofold it's the success that he's had Jim or a bus had a lot of success we know what he did at Stanford I got the three straight NFC titled games with the forty niners what's a whisker away from winning the super bowl\nSo when you bring bring Jim horrible back to his alma mater people expect big things to happen especially Michigan fans\nAnd then when you couple that with his paycheck yeah the expectations should be high and he hasn't met those yet so I don't I don't think we should get get after Michigan State when that's all I'm saying\nBut I did I'm Sorry you did you did a guy 'cause people ...\nTo I think these people that are saying get rid of them get him out of there you are out of your mind that it was I should knee jerk reaction where he worries that\nLet him keep building it he is good for that school and all the results haven't bed where the you know the the fans want them he is still a fantastic head coach just kick them to the curb because you've been disappointed that's going way too far with it man\nPeople are crazy that's what it calls they are fanatics that's

not your worst\n[laughter] ha I got a\nLittle applaud my partner here because I was like gung ho last week with the Green Bay Packers beat him to Detroit Lions two lines put a dolphins thousands of foreign two lines of two or three list with the lions beat those Packers thirty one twenty three and you called it be you know you called it I I I thought that was a guinea I thought that game was it gave me but\nIt's not it's not Green Bay and it certainly is not Aaron Rodgers a full strays but still an old Detroit beat him list with your job has beat the bears an OTC thirty one twenty eight and today the line on that game I have Miami plus three Miami plus three against alliance\nYeah and it's [noise] I mean really for a four and two dolphins team you still have to wonder which team is going to show up you know because we had absolutely crushed\nAgainst the uh the patriots that was ugly and then they followed it up against your bangles and that was an ugly ugly second half particularly the fourth quarter to seven touchdowns given up yeah that was ugly so yeah it was a great\nJust a a unforeseen win against the bears with rock and roll last Wyler back there was there for a thirty one points man in overtime and he's back today against the lions\nAnd I would say I'm brought up an interesting point earlier we were talking and he's like why why are the dolphins underdogs here you've got a dome team going out to just the the elements we always talk about the elements being the the wind in the snow and no rain and all that how about the heat\nThat as a home field advantage big time the first couple of months in Miami and for a dome seemed to go there from Detroit also I Want to see how the lions with their terrible run defense handled the heat in Miami Today\nYeah you're exactly right but I tell you what this one thing on the dolphins right now you could do about brought us while they're all you want he's replaced with the injured ride tannahill\nAnd it's funny because the dog was put on their best off as the performance of the season last week with him you know I'm not giving them any credit for that but they did but the one thing that office had the future hall of fame when they're running back Frank or I don't know how this guy does it he's averaging almost five yards\nA game I mean how many years has he been in the league but really I mean the guy it's like a machine he he's on his way of the hall of fame and he's been on so many different teams but with San Francisco and the an apple\nIt's now Miami I'm sure he still has it he still has it I mean I I'm an ... I don't think the guy gets\nThe the accolades that he deserves every once in a while you watch a game you hear an announcement owner Frank or what he is done and the punishment that he has had to overcome all these years and he's still he's still pointed out he's still give the arts every game it's it's amazing\nI couldn't agree more you're right he was the third round pick in two thousand five\nThat's unheard of for a running back to doing as productive as he's Ben you're talking about\nIt just a running style really Andy is he's between the tackles he's no nonsense he's like the running back version of Tim Duncan you know\nYeah no he's real you know Barry Sanders cuts but just productive man she went up yards throughout his entire career and yeah he's under sold these still not among you know name recognition why look at the company he's around\nIn terms of career rushing and look at where his name's slot among the bigger names you you've got names like Eric Dickerson is a much bigger name than Frank Gore in ... and didn't gain as many yards\nI I think he's very similar to Curtis Martin you know in terms of name recognition Curtis Martin never got the accolades that would be on the same level as his career rushing total would you know it wasn't there\nThat you made it really is and in the same the same token the less is less a degree of course under the alliance side of things golden Tate is burning up the league and no one knows about golden tape and I know that doctors could stop and today is that five receptions and every game thirty three on the year and\nI Want to see if the dolphins deepest could stop golden Tate was Mathew South Africa to have a field day today 'cause these ... these dolphins\nYeah I I I wouldn't be surprised because the dolphins past Russia's not very good camera in wake who doesn't seem to age either he's been banged up quite a bit this year maybe just starting to age now [laughter] maybe that's the case\nBut Cameron whites obese in without him William Hayes is on IRR because he tried to avoid landing on their car didn't want to get a penalty and tore his ACL black guys the nickname of\nCharles Harris their first round pick last year he hasn't been very productive so if they keep Matthew Stafford clean and that pocket he could do a lot of damage today big time damage\nThere is no doubt about that now I Know your dolphins fan I Want you to speak with your head now with your heart but let's do this game\nI kinda like the lions and a close one but I like the lions I just think that they have too many weapons and I I don't trust below under censor I don't know I really don't [laughter]\nYeah well you might not have to trust them that could be the good news is the Detroit running defense is so bad you might get a heavy dose of Frank Goran Kenyan Drake today and take a lot of that pressure off of all the O's plate you know\nSo I I agree with you\nI think that the lions probably come in after a by I think they probably get a road when I I don't love it I Love the over more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the over forty six and a half I Love taking the over\nWas shot a coach in right now is on hold by the way that I mentioned that one of the whole says so they come with the Arizona Cardinals that's me because when it comes to this gay we're very very similar the cargo sneak a nice thing\nI Can't that lower income Brian's on it for a week in a row hot streak right now it's the same\nHere I Am not going to do this anymore but I I always said well you're leaving was Sam takeover next week\nYeah All right Brian only needs for morning when the world series it seems like at this point like goodness yeah speaking of that it wasn't a great week but you know a win is a Windsor Brian you went to one uh you got one out of three correct but\nHow good enough to get the when I got nothing and for being when Sandy I hate to and surprisingly both a browns and chargers kicker is made every single kick in the last game so I I mean it was watching\nThat game and they're just booting up through the up rights and I'm like who's going to mess up\nOur I won't moving on to this week here starting from a you know the first game of last year the NFL international series so you know the ones in Mexico city in London\nThere's been there have been six blowout including last week's lost by the raiders today's first game happens to be another London contest between the titans and charges you guys talked about it six thirty AM P. T. over under twenty two and a half point margin of victory between Tennessee in Los Angeles\nBrian guys under my goodness you think the titans are going to get role that badly\nI mean every other teen and all this year they didn't get involved by that average you may\nWant to you mentioned I'm going to say over I said that the charges rule the titans in I'm In love list with the times was shut out by the ravens\nI'll tell you the wrong don't don't underestimate the power of an ...\nAnd when you give up a lesbian sacks during one game I think the titans team they might not be very good but they're going to be highly focused and they're going to be ticked off and that might help them execute better today would they at least keep a closer than what is it twenty two and a half two and a half\nThree touchdown you don't think they can keep it within three touches\nHow they got jetlag to Mario worked in the mix this so far has been but uh yeah I think eleven sections like went away from the like the NFL record it or yeah it's crazy that used a graceful ...\nYeah they they get paid jak yeah\nAll right we'll build a coal source of moving over to that one that's up in a few hours as I'm sure you've heard the bills that will be starting Derek Anderson if you'd be even though you know they just signed the guy off the street pretty much a week and a half ago\nAndrew work he's been a pick machine also throwing five interceptions in his last two games the over under three and a half picks total and bills that cult will go into these\nTeams the multimedia combined total Derek hey there's a lot of them the first quarter [laughter]\nNow I said ... and Peter\nYeah lived though I Love the reports come out with the team is like yo don't start Pete urban don't even think about it right I'm going to take the under though that's a lotta picks today\nI mean even if it's two interceptions by both quarterbacks you know that's what you'd have to to get to\nTo get to the old for a German one doesn't have to report any more than ...

Fox News\nFrom the men do Buick GMC studios his talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nSports trendy and\nNow does it back to the world series every five to one victory in game seven of the ... in Milwaukee Cody village or hit a two run home run to the top of the second was MVP of the series we'll see if we go up to three hits and also I just read one home run of his own by him as he gets the WWE and relief or LA started uses checked seems that the last\nThey do they definitely need\nThis game they should win it and I'll give Sam Donald a lot more props if he has a an equally good game today against Minnesota in Minnesota they don't have the defense they had last year\nBut that's still a good defense and much better than the colds there's no doubt about that sort of Sam Donaldson string together good back to back games and today against the Vikings I'll give them a lot of credit but er it's not going to be easy today against them no but who do you like though\nI like the Vikings I think the Vikings get it done today I mean it's kind of a dangerous game to play when we go back but\nThe way the Arizona Cardinals played on Thursday night uh and for the Vikings who has a ten point when but it wasn't impressive it was an emphatic wasn't anything like that there are still floppy you know I'm Still waiting for the Vikings team to put it together\nThey look like the Thirteen and three Vikings from last year\nAnd they just haven't been able to do that yet so I Can't bully buy into them but I just think they're simply a better team than the jets at this point they've got it decimated secondary looked for Adam feeling to have a huge game today because you're going to have a sixth around rookie trying to guard him\nWith ah what is it over there Perry Dickerson\nYeah when you get old Perry Nick or send matched up\nOn an Adam feeling that is a big time mismatch so what do you live ... take advantage of that\nYou could live with this list you know and you're right if I was going to win this game to just a bit of tea but\nProbably one of the better gays might be the best game of the day the saints at the ravens saints for one raving oh yeah two and a loss for the same today will be the first lawsuits opening day the forty eight forty look to Tampa Bay and I'm looking at the line right now it looks right now that both well mine is two and a half\nBaltimore given up two and a half to New Orleans today is a good game it really is and of course game is in Baltimore so we'll see what happens now raves defenses tremendous shut up tendency last week to anyone zip and uh the raid was were the NFL's best third downs defenses so\nThis game matches one of the ... best passing a tax which Drew Brees ... what are the best past defenses so we'll see what happens today\nYeah how 'bout that the ravens are the only team Drew Brees hasn't beaten in his Eighteen year career only team that's the last one is going to check off the list\nAnd I'll tell you this if you look at the St I Know the matchup is what you're saying Andy it's that scene saw fence against that ravens defund says going to be fantastic to watch wrecks but if you look at the opposite\nIf you look at the saints they've got the seventh lowest pressure rate the season and Joe Flaco is actually been very good when not pressured it's got a touchdowns one pick in those situations so when he's got a clean pocket believe it or not Joe Flaco has been doing some damage to the season\nWell he's he's got the you know why he's got some young fast receivers which you had that in the past\nThey've got a decent Ron game to right now so but but still it all I I think at the end of the day you got a great defense which to me will always be a better off that and I think they're able to go the windows ... plus one be a real close game but I think the rabies with maybe one of those games at last team with the ball was the game\nYeah it's a tough one for me to see Andy because I really the games that are tough to forecast are the ones that I can totally see going each way like the opposite happening I can see the same even though they don't play great defense\nKeeping Drew Brees relatively clean today and they're often scoring enough points where the ravens just can't match points\nAnd I can see the opposite happening where the ravens play really good defense the saints can't get pressure on Joe Flaco and the rage and just keep rolling their in a bit of a groove right now I can see both things clearly happening and so it's a toss up for me man\nAnd while you're up you're probably favor the home team\nYeah that's what I say I mean when it comes right down to what I mean both was tremendous at home they really are going to be very tough at home also to beat so I I think if I were to uh make a pick up I had to make a pick up this game I looked at both the boy and a close game probably by three or four points no more than that less than a touchdown I'd say\nYeah should be a good one man maybe you'd go teaser maybe you throw this game into a teaser where you get extra points where you think we should do that Andy from when they had to give them ... success with teaser this year you\nWill not have this game and those picks that I could promise [laughter]\nYou're right about that I Will not have it\nAll right Brian no any

Mac do you think it goes as far to negate ... Rob ... ski probably being out do you think that it negates the advantage for the bears defensively with him being a little bit ...\nAround you know looking back it's going to make is seventieth street or he's going to play in the Seventy a straight game you actually didn't start one game when he first arrived in Chicago and that's unfortunate for him because he had that starting street going but we have to see you know that's the thing we just don't know how how you know\nHow much is going to be able to do on that and we do know Rob Gronkowski most likely out of course this hits him in the pocket book as well sixty two thousand five hundred dollars flies out\nThe window because you that the amount of money that he makes every game that he is active it also is it makes it more difficult for him to collect on an incentive package it couldn't be collecting three point three million dollars reportedly has backed locked up in practice on friday they decided not to have them take the trip\nTo Chicago so it's been interesting interesting season as well Tom Brady his use of this by now right not having all his weapons\nFirst four days or you finally get everyone back and then boom gr in ... he goes down at least for a week now get ESPN reporting that\nHe should be back ... should be back for the Monday Night game against buffalo got to see on Mac you know and this barest team it was so disappointing last week but there were shenanigans yet dare I say shenanigans pulled by the Miami Dolphins\nYeah I'll be forthcoming with this Ryan tannahill shoulder injury ... your game planning for a different quarterback it is a it is an adjustment\nFor this team and the dolphins being investigated for shenanigans on the internal report\nRight speak English in ... borders a quarterback said three touchdowns six turnovers in a two game spin is this time in Jacksonville running out\nYes I mean if you if this is the way the season is going to go I mean look you still there ... there are people in that organization that banging the drum for like ... and he's a guy who's extremely popular among his teammates they they really it really is they believe that he's a winter he works hard you know it's just not a dynamic player and and the problem they're having is\nThird and long and this was a fear of the jaguars organization going into the season that there would be stuck in third in long situation\nShe was potentially and they would struggle to convert I I don't think the ... is is disappointing as the defense I mean they gave up forty points last week\nTo Dallas to Dallas okay I mean ... easily it's still catching passes against them because they can't cover guys in the ... and that comes off the game they play the gets Kansas City where the chiefs also put a forty point I mean this is not the drivers are spending so much money on the defensive side of the football have so much blue chip talent\nThey have to figure something out right there big game against she used to and I'm telling you the Indianapolis Colts did that division a disservice they could have crippled the Houston Texans chances for competing in this division by just going for the tie\nYou know and overtime you know don't go for it our fourth and for play for the tie you're going to stay in your state boy and\nAs far as the playoff race but at that point the Texans would have been over three and one and they and they would have pretty much been over instead by having the chance to win that game by stopping the colds and then go and you compare it to feel go they won three straight there now sitting on top of the division with jet Tennessee in Jacksonville and the culture sitting down at the bottom dum dum dum dum dum\nHow about this game Alix sane at the raising of the match up with the St softens raising defense how do you see that one shaken out\nDoes anyone play defense in the NFL anymore I think it's the ravens than anyone else I mean really I mean when you think about it right I mean they've been so dominant eleventh attacks against the the Tennessee Titans in fact Marcus Mario they just sacked him across the pond\nI don't know if you're aware of that they just got his wealth I mean that's how I mean that's how well they're playing you know an on off into a little bit of hit and miss you know for them I mean look Joe Flaco up\nJoe Flaco down I mean that's how it is but you know it does save Drew Brees has never beaten the Baltimore Ravens so he has a played them all heck of a lot either but he has never won a game against them years over three and his NFL career here's a stat that may surprise you did you know that the saint of\nThe NFL's number one run defense Seventy one point for yards a game that is all they're giving up his defense is starting to come together a little bit more by the way another milestone for Drew Brees today sadly I don't think we'll see David Baker the pro Football Hall of fame president and

for money for it about Malcolm took the high road and his posting news conference about this Eric read attacking and verbally or on the field\nAnd during the interview process but it just goes to show to that even an issue like this to players can stay unified why NFL Owners are laughing when they talk about lockouts and\nThings like that and twenty Twenty one the players can't get their own act together why should the NFL Owners be worried about them sticking together and holding out for better financial you know a compensation over over sixteen game season\n[noise] yeah that that that was

game Nineteen twenty so I ask you in that moment do you think my ... made the right call for his team\nYes when before that specific team for this yes yes what about you a league\nKnow you got to tie it up you got to go to overtime there give the London fence a little more action\nOkay so\nOkay speaking to hold on leaf speaking not as a sports guy as a fan and let's say that's your team what are you what do you want to uh overtime where you can possibly blow the game any way or just winning right now\nI I say go to overtime you got to force that over time see what you could do there you don't want to lose it on one play like that\nSo what you got to realize is let me set this up a little bit for you so\nThe second half of the game Tennessee Titans dominated right they\nDominated they were able to move the ball at will they gave the chargers ... you know a trouble moving the ball so they were in in in farm control of the situation so instead of\nTying the ball a tiny ball game up and
