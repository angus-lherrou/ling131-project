I Know it's the month of October and I know you want to get into it but I we we will save that for later on here's why it's a bad idea from Matt in Aggie to wear a visor while doing a game ... in Miami\nWhere for whatever reason I don't know who built the stadium but their shadows everywhere it looks like monsters attacking you and I don't know how the receivers and keep throwing the football and all the shadows there so in a legal advantage for the Miami Dolphins but\nMatt ... where's this visor his head is getting charred the top of his head is getting charred\nHe's going to take that visor off later on tonight he's probably still wearing it right now in on the plane somebody's going to go hey man what's with the red yarmulke like its sunburn on his head it's completely sunburned he was getting short it doesn't make any sense he's got no hair\nWe have young bald member on the show here yeah\nAnd his name is Bowe bow yes oh that's right\nThe reason why you might revise their is because since we have no here we sweat a lot so the visor will catch it\nOr even if you have swear bull though you you sweat I mean wouldn't ... catch it to where do rag\nAnd what it well then he will be looked at funny if you or do I go to Israel and they let you go to the director and if you like a a coach sagging only\nWith either way I feel bad that old I was hit by a bandana [laughter]\nMap Patricia wear a hat backwards that were sort of do rag\nYes no ... no no backwards if not worse than it is it still had to do right on the right way\nI mean come on man you can't they don't have one of\nThe global Bogle hold on why can you just wear a hat if that's the case\nMaybe he doesn't want to say honestly it and I really have to agree with you the bristles nice like Johnny doesn't feel joke\nThis kind of just chime in for a second 'cause there was one point in my fire show during my course of crappy jobs I did work in a holster right ah\nOh yeah I ah my parents wanted me get a job at ... yeah yeah well at least I was gainfully employed that my true people ... oh you don't want it I find that once if okay okay yeah I think he was ... ah I did I Do remember getting a visor and I always thought it was cool look though when you had hair\nTo be able to have like the hair kind of come up out of the top with the visor though is that not a fan of ...

game it was one of the weirdest football games I've ever seen in my life but it was not great football game that was a couple of mediocre football teams and nobody could figure out whether or not they want to do when\nThat's how that uh that was exactly what I feel like boats fan bases deserved\n... can I explain myself and fleas do for all the Chicago Bears fans and you may be included in this I'm watching the hot star and all of a sudden was like no no the bears\nIs this year you know this is the second coming of eighty five bears with Dick and all the rest um there was some thought that that that may be what this team was\nI think those came to a screeching halt watching how just inept at times they're often was uh the stress on the struggles that they had\nUm and and then for the dolphins fans you know they're kinda here's the thing that that are I struggle with what the dolphins fans there's some people and there's a there's a small select amount or die hard I stick with them thicker than\nBut then there's the others who were just straight bandwagon and when they were three of those are like this is it this year we're going to win the apes he's were on top or number one right now ahead of the New England patriots\nAnd and that was kind of their approach then after the last two weeks rather like same old dolphins team you know throw throw in the towel season's over with right so they just have this like complete polarizing ... relationship right\nSo this is what they deserve you deserve to watch I'd be drug through a terrible football game were honestly no one's deserved to win that game to served ended its high now you know I mean I'm Glad ... park he was able to uh was part was a party knows the other kid\nOut of another to Sanders editor who care Sanders centers will calm Finkel re think cousin actually\nLet's just go why don't we just if we're going to get throwback to kick hers I'm Pete story on a bitch or who won the game for the\nDay look ... that is just something about that yeah that's pulling one from deep inside of family and it's had rented in that and it's getting a cab and it's not often I go that deep\nNo no [laughter] do you get increased up a little bit but ah [noise] that uh yeah that no one to serve to win that game that was to hum average football teams but it does make the question what did you see ... what I saw I loved it I loved every bit of a\nMan well he owns the bears three and oh yeah you just read them now but he's three ... three different teams like it's not like Aaron ...\nAudrey zoning the bears and he's always been with the Packers and he's a great quarterback raucous while there's not a great quarterback and he goes to three different teams and he beat some every time and he was announced the starter like what at an hour before kickoff\nI mean I I think she had a pretty good idea of it when they started to when when rights you know ... report late in the week I think they started to prepare us while at that point they just didn't let the media and all that\nUm it did seem like ... like he suffered a little bit of an ankle injury in that game and it seemed like it and you can speak to this because you live in South Florida playing football as a down linemen in that heat and it goes to overtime how much the disadvantages that for you when you're not used to it\n[noise] it's a it's a pretty big disadvantage I think it's not so much the seat that gets you it's just the humidity um and and the only reason I can\nKind of see the differences you know the humidity is what you feel you're suffocating like I always used to explain to people I Love training in Florida in the off season because when you go up somewhere um doors there's not as quiet as quite as high humidity and and when you know you're in South Florida you're\nUm you know in one of those more human environments it feels like it's hard to breathe like like you're breathing and ... house to describe it almost as if if you've ever been an altitude and you've got upstairs or um you know you you had to you know climate something and and you're all of a sudden like extremely outta breath\nIt's it's kind of like that but you just you labor more to breathe in that environment so that's\nUsually the toughest part I but I actually kind of like the humidity because I always feel like it helped you um get warm and then stay warm yeah it wasn't as difficult to get your body warmed up to play\n'em it's just you know you get exhausted man if you don't stay hydrated that's when you can end up getting you know those little injury is here and there would there's no doubt appointed impact on them ...\nOne of the oldest tricks and you've seen you know fighters do this and some people that try and get in shape is that do work out at altitude like they'll go to big bear\nUm you know the train at altitude and the idea is you know it helps with the thin air it it'll help you get into better condition but what it also they're finding is that you don't recover as fast so I Wonder if being in the humidity\nIf you are able to recover faster and recovery is such an important part of being in shape if maybe that just plays to the advantage like everybody has an advantage you know if the dolphins go play in Chicago in January ... or December rather\nAnd in that case a once heights are kind of dropped I think there was a bit of a mess caught up in front of the pocket and he just through the kind of a spot where Travers tells us go on and never saw it's our\nUm so this is now a touchdown for the New England patriots Sony Michel end of the end zone and the patriots will capitalize on the turnover by Patrick homes look ... last week was his worst game of the season and I had a couple of interceptions now he's got an early interception here\nI I I look I Know that we always we tell ourselves this you know don't jumping the gun you know let everything play out don't hype everything up too much don't be such a knee jerk reactor kind of person on radio don't do\nWhat we all did it we saw with the guy pulled off on Monday Night football a couple of weeks ago in Denver he was phenomenal it was outstanding and it was really fun to watch I to me the patriots happening this extra time to prepare\nWhen you talk to guys in and around the NFL or guys that have played for the patriots what is it the ballot check does with that extra time that other coaches don't seem to do\nI I don't know if there's anything that he does that that different I I just think his attention to detail and how it goes about preparing you for these different situations um and and really attacking\nYou know one of the things you have to respect about New England that they do we can work out is it's an entirely different game plan you know there's games with a run about fifty times there's the following week they'll throw the ball fifty times and it's all predicated on what they feel like your weaknesses are and how to exploit them\nSo to be flexible enough to do that and to be able to be um\nYou know kind of not run it put yourself in a box you know it's tough to do sometimes that people would want to talk about an identity um your identity wants to ... wants to be a football team that's able to take advantage of whatever the weaknesses of your opponent you don't need it necessarily just over a great running football team okay may become becomes predictable to stop right\nSo I think that's the thing that they do better than anyone else has every single week there's always gonna be some new wrinkle you didn't see it or you weren't prepared for that you have to make in game adjustments for\nAnd then they're really good at doing that you know it it's almost like a a fight you come out the first few rounds you're trying to kind of feel some things out based on what you saw before he went into a match\nAnd then all of a sudden the fourth fifth sixth around there there's something else has been thrown your way so that's kind of how their games typically go and they're adjustments or every single drive every single series there's some little wrinkle some little adjustment\nYou know Brady one I think of the ah the Oakland Raiders [noise]\n\nI think of a I think of the autumn Williams is a pirate [noise] I think of Savage host during ... from ...\nI think of ... an organization with a rebellious owners why I think of\nPlayers up and down the roster that may or may not have been on performance enhancing drugs\nI think of the violence and I think a full contact I think of broken bones I think of bruises I think of blood and sweat [noise]\nThe one thing I don't think of the operating Clinton [noise] it's I don't think of tears\nAnd there's some images going around on social media and I know we're going to get into the John gluten aspect of the raiders and where this team is but there's some stuff\nGoing around on social media of their car who appears to be crying\nAfter he goes down with the injury on Sundays so it begs the question Brady when you bring the quarterback who is played for many organizations and has played for the powerful playoff bound Notre Dame fighting Irish I might add you Brady Quinn have you ever cried during the game\n[noise] um I don't know if I've ever cried during a game um I Do remember I played three\nA broken foot one time in high school that was really really painful um and that one was probably hard to kind of hold back some of those emotions are but I don't think I've ever cried during a game no\nUm so what do you make of their car is he trying to have you seen the image have you seen the video going around it appears\nThat he's an old guy get be that's you know some guys handle stuff differently\nI'm not criticizing I'm just saying that's what it sounds like you're being critic I look I'm not criticized just sounds like it'd be a bad luck\nRight I'm just I have been critical right

point and I urge radio station\n[noise]\nTalk courts trending\nIn the American league championship series game too at Boston and I started David Price just out in the fifth inning with the red Sox lead five for over Houston top of the fish they've gotten these five runs off\nThe browns a year ago when he more than two games of Carson when's it doesn't happen\nBy the way how's that working out for ... yeah on a Thursday night but we don't know how he's going to be over the next five years with that is going\nTo look right and so but but you have to call it what it is and the browns were way too hyped going into this game on Sunday but they've been too hyped and you can look it up or just look at the team record and then we'll get Mayfield numbers they are average to below average all across the board and that's fine\nBut don't tell me and try and sell me on there the next best best thing we love the browns the browser back no it's not that the browns are good they are just better than they were like you you don't want a hotdog tastes great right after you've been eating dog food for three weeks right it doesn't mean you're eating good you're just eating better than you were\nOkay that's actually kind of a lie I I don't know that a hot dog ever does good okay\nWell yeah the dice it up a little bit you got to put a peppers and stuff like that on it but the point being I put some pretend like all of a sudden they've gone from a there are there now flame and you don't know they're just to step up from spam it's it's what they are now that that's that's who the browns are and that's not to knock him at all and Baker Mayfield it's not to knock him\nLike I think they did the right thing in taking him number one I liked Baker Mayfield but if we're going to be honest here and and if we're going to call it like it is shamed Arnold is playing the best of any rookie quarterback in the NFL I'm Sorry if you look at Mayfield performances compared to Sam Donaldson Donald's playing better than Baker Mayfield\n... and I think you can make the case that same don't has less yes they are made for owning a hundred percent so he's even statistically if at some point it doesn't compare I think him even being close to a bigger given what each of those two teams house on the roster it's nuts\nDay um as far as that's how the brown versus other New York jets so there there's no doubt about that and and and look Josh Allen who's gonna have a hard time of surviving without offensive line I'm just the fact that they've won some games is miraculous to be quite honest with you\nOr by the way would you like to hear Baker Mayfield therefore it on ... years old here's old bake after the game\nI'm at fault for majority of that and you know I'm going to be very hard on myself but we have to be able to look at this and learn from it has to be more prepared to coming into next week it doesn't matter what's happened and met her the buzz you have to do your job each week or else I'm it's just the the nature of the game I'll be the first to tell you I'm going to go to work and I'm gonna get it fixed\n'em by the way out of the reason also why I like the chargers to win\nThis game a lot of people pointed out ah nah nah nah come on traveling all that way\nAnd they're the road team I got news for you to the road team at home to okay there used to being on the road the culture back baby they both are back Brady five sacks of Baker may feel they don't even have Joey boso yet the season the bolts are back\nOnce they get boso back I I think they're going to have a much much much better chance to make that statement my concern is\nUm they were they beat a team with a five hundred record ride the browns are two two and one coming into those yeah but they were on hard knocks right but my whole point is like tell me the last time the chargers have beat a playoff team\nLike honestly tell me the last time they've had success first teams with winning records I just until the chargers are able to be better opponents\nI just can't buy into that team because we've seen them be able to be five hundred teams are teams of losing records we've we've seen that from them it seems that they have to contend with that are going to be the teams that they may see again\nIn the playoffs those are the ones that they tend to struggle with the regular season or they have those those got awful games against so I uh like I think it's difficult to situation there are there you know and having to put a centrally\nYou know sixteen away games but the bottom line is they just haven't really beat some of the the toughest opponents since I'm I'm kinda waiting and be a patient to see that so\nBasically what you're saying is that the chargers are fifty three ... used to average [laughter] that's what you're saying I mean they they're not being good teams that's what you're saying I\nAm just I'm I'm going by or a man that is a I don't even know what to make it a that's all right\nI mean I don't know I didn't even know where it came from All right so a ... year Fox Sports radio has become the live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next though

LA local radio who who he got a little lazy by the end didn't actually write down scores recently [laughter]\nOn TV in front of him and this these were in the days before the the score was always in the corner of the screen\nHe did exactly what you're saying for I'm not kidding three minutes he went on channel nine Laker score on the TV and they never did he had to end his update he turned the Mike off and just started screaming\nAll because it was on TV back in the day when it wasn't when they didn't have the scoreboard up on the screen of that committee that's right Steve giving his Lakers were for he's telling everything about the game and in three minutes not once did he give the score of the game\nWell Steve out here we are in fact I told you she shot [laughter]\nOnly Michel

talk it was a good shot\nIt was and I assume you you made it to a microphone so I assume you made it to LAX well after midnight an entire and all that\nI had early flight the next morning but I actually had to go with our crew back to their hotel and then over back because I was staying in a different spot with my wife the wife came out for the uh the trip so it was good little this is kind

right\nSo ah so just knocks Brady quitting here on Fox Sports radio um so we're talking about this uh John ... situation in Oakland um do you want to hear a little John Gurdon post game and yeah you want to hear some uh some good stuff from John Gurdon post game so it's a weird dialing up a little John crude and post game\nI'm here on Fox Sports radio so we were able to get a hold of John ... or we will have and making the parents are on the show here's what I Want to say about ...\nI I think that we over hyped the raiders and I think that we over hyped the raiders similar to what we did with the browns because they had been so bad for so long that when they finally had that one pretty good year and made it to the playoffs we assume that this was a team that was back and they were on the right track\nBut let's be honest if you go back to that year\nA lot of things went there way there the last place schedule there were a lot of flu the games I can remember the season opener at New Orleans a bunch of crazy place at the raiders one there were a lot of things that bounce the way of the Oakland Raiders and it was nothing that you look at and go oh that's probably sustainable I Wonder if we overhyped Garrett car\nI Wonder if we over hyped ... Cooper I Wonder if we uh overhyped everybody on that team outside of ... Mac\nAnd I think that we went into this season assuming that the Oakland Raiders last year was an anomaly they'll figure it all out and I think that we assume that this team was better than it was and maybe grew in isn't wrong in walking in there and going\nYeah I don't like what I see here I've got a ten year contract to give me some room to work and some time to work and I'm gonna try and turn the franchise around right or wrong I think that's what he looked at\nI ah I don't necessarily feel the same I feel like this roster does a lot of talent and I think it there it's been a combination of things um between coaching turnover changes scheme um I think that's been a product of it they got some injuries to I mean obviously the you're on the last day or a car I kind of hurt 'em you they're going in the playoffs or knew who knows how to finish his out\nHow he comes back to the next year I mean you'd you'd never know um but I I don't necessarily see at the same way I I think this is a good team I just think they've kind of been mismanaged miss handled in some ways to [noise]\nUm and and I don't think like the whole idea of them moving and knowing that that's why the end of that title was rapidly approaching and I think that's probably kind of wearing a ... on their minds and everything else is is that whole\nScenario kind of you know it's ... right it's got to it I don't I don't know how it goes and like I remember when I was up what part of the rams and twenty Thirteen I mean there's there's talk of the moving done and and the equipment guys talked about it they're like yeah I mean we've illicit teams there in LA the first time so\nYou know they're talking about the difficulties of that and just how expensive it is in Southern California and the stress that brings and not knowing a hundred percent at that point\nUm but just hearing rumors of it I mean it it ... the people out there is some players who you know you'd never look really pastor next opponent but you can't help it because everyone else in your family worries about it so when they hear the rumors of oh was it seemed to LA\nThey're asking you they're constantly every single week all heard another rumor her no story and so there bothering you with us you you can't help but um you know internalize that stuff and and it does you know play a factor on you\nYeah I ... I mean and and I think that maybe that sort of under ... understated and people have been brought that up enough but when you wake up every single day and there's constant uncertainty\nLike there's nothing more frustrating the waking up to a dirty house or waking up to a bunch of boxes laying around or a bunch of suitcases and it's just you're just starting off on the wrong foot you just start and I think the raiders for the past couple of years have just been kind of in this law in this in between like they don't even know where they're playing next year\nLike ... there's no stadium up yet in Vegas they're not sure where they're going to play you assume they're just going to find another one year lease to play in Oakland but they don't even know what's happening next year and I do think that that isn't discussed enough like to me that would wear on me if you've ever watched the documentary and you know just growing up in Cleveland the year the browns\nWe're leaving in the mid nineties when they were going to Baltimore like they interviewed some of those players the browns we're a pretty good team bell jak had them back and in contention and they were looking like a team that was on the rise when the decision was made for them to move\nMembers of that team and I think even Bella check included said we were finished we there was no coming back from that because the constant uncertainty of weight so we're really gone uh this is really happening like we're in this isn't just a dream like I think that weighs on teams get weighed\nOn MIke McCoy and the chargers when he was leaving in a in San Diego I think it it does have an impact on some of these players in Oakland\nHundred percent and and look that team right that that seem that ended up leaving and finding a new home of Baltimore\nBut the minute of wanting a super good team at I mean there was a great thing that both were able to see him as a century the extension of what were the old Brown's that's when people always ask me like oh you grow up in a browser that that's kinda miserable I'm not really the browns were actually a pretty darn good football friday night\nBut when they came back in Ninety nine there and expansion team that was entirely new organization different deal you know same Jersey same teams same city but it wasn't the same team that left like that she was bill to be able to have success just hadn't quite gotten over the hump and then obviously they were able to get back and what was it two thousand", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "15"}
