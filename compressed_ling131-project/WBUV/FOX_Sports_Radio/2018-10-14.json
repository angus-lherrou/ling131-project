it exciting what was it ... it was a\nPositive words about baseball that's a nice man\nStep in the right direction step in the right direction you know at the risk of engaging and verbal fisticuffs I have a question for you from All right [noise] okay window so are you know you see a few when I we were on opposite ends of the aisle reading we're we're okay I got a question for you though\nFor these people like you the blooming\nHeart of America for the UCF nights we leave Earth Day ranked higher and here's the thing\nCome I don't hear a nice thing about the undefeated teams ranked lower than UCF how come I don't hear anything about Colorado they've got a game of us see tonight how come I don't hear anything about in the state they're undefeated\nYeah bye week there at Clemson next week how 'bout South Florida same conference they're undefeated rank twenty third right now\nThe only difference is\nOf has a history\nOf\nBeing undefeated all last year the only undefeated team in college football do you understand that so I'm not bashing on those I'm saying hey when do you start recognizing the team that has been lost in two years\nRight in there right number ten and they will move up because some teams lost in the top ten so they will move up and if they went out and other teams falter in the top ten we may be sitting here\nLike oh you may be going crazy like autism third\nDo you think that UCF is better than Washington Washington number seven they lost at Oregon mhm you didn't UCS better than Washington\nI don't know to tell you the truth I really don't know but what do you think\nI don't know I thought Notre Dame was much better than pit until they played the game today ... ... you get that right like so it's easy for us to say oh well this team is better than that team Boise State of Oklahoma was better than Boise State when we saw them in the ... the fiesta bowl\nRemember that like so you can't do that it's one game is one game so abusive words at play Washington\nI Can't sit here or a hundred percent as say they're better than ... it's one team that I Would say okay they may be an above their head and that's Alabama because that's the way Alabama does everyone\nBut I Would give back the money I went on this teaser if UCF want last today you know what I've made the decision\nI Can't even do it or you can't do it [laughter] they put money in your pocket and you are so against them but you can even do it you can't even accept\nThe money because they don't deserve the props like here's the thing he from I disagree with your point I understand it and a lot of people think that way this is about the twenty eight teams season is that about twenty Seventeen is not about any of these teams what they did last year it's all about this year\nOkay okay so aid from I there's no way we disagree about this next story ... ... right to care indeed [laughter] I like how you're skeptical um\nI'd make a joke and throwing UCF down even want to do that I'm Colin Kaepernick\nShe was initially not involved in a photo gallery on the San Francisco forty niners website they were putting this gallery together as far as the history between the niners and the Green Bay Packers\nBecause that the match up this weekend right right so do you plan on Monday Night football the forty niners posted dozens of photos on their website ... games against the Packers know Colin Kaepernick and they've apologize or like our bad sorry about that now\nTo throw it out there there was a photo gallery this is the first one to run this year there were pictures in seven galleries that were posted last year and capital appeared in every single one on the teams website\nSo there's that backdrop but this can't happen\nYou look at Capra Nikki rush for a hundred and eighty one yards in a playoff win against the Packers sort of memorable it was an NFL record and the very next year he led a game winning drive in another playoff win against the Packers\nAnd it's one of these where you have to double triple quadruple check that it doesn't happen because\nOf how it looks it looks like it's gotta be intentional there's no way you could just coincidentally forget to add Colin Kaepernick but I Can't say that it's intentional because\nYou would have to be orderly just plain dead really have no foresight whatsoever\nIf you fail to see what would happen next if you intentionally did something like that and it wouldn't make any sense because they've backed Capra Nick\nAnd his anthem protests back when he was with the niners and they've donated donated a million dollars they matched his million dollars as well so I think it's just a mistake but it's a mistake that just cannot happen because of how it\nLook it's not a mistake I bet you I mean when you're going over the pictures are you going to select based on performances in those games\nHow do you know what I eat right I ... I mean you have the ... the the pictures throws your I Would like being the pictures yeah you have to not let them on purpose because they're they're right the information is there so\nLike most brainstorming here right who had a great performance again or is it really remember a geo with the catch ... against the Packers you that uh what else comes to mind is how do you not think of Colin Kaepernick\nWas bogus it is disrespectful because they act like he murdered someone right\nThing to me is that's why I don't think it's an automatic is how would you not know this was going to be a huge deal how would you not know that you would have to apologize are bad\n... in those positions can read the rural and that's the problem why do you think we\nHave some soul many apologies\nRight how many are already been we have so many missteps from fortune five hundred companies to team right the people making decisions can't read the room\nRemember when the owner of the Miami Dolphins came onset of players taking me that they will be fine and suspended\nRight and then three days later who knows\nYou know three days later right read the room eighty five percent of your players are African American right and you're going to make a statement like that\nI guess you could also say similar to the the football video game I think it was the Madden\nGame begs same thing same exact thing miracles cabernet grape ridiculous like they were going to like ... and then they were going to go for that like they'll be okay\nGood [laughter] are coming up next to us the most painful losses today\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn for you\nThat's your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a nurse practitioner for ... years experience acute care certification indeed have the huge pool of amazing candidate and screen or tools that help you\nFind your most qualified applicants and in dire shortlist of unicorns do more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire post your job and indeed dot com slash higher\nIndeed the world's number one job site source ...\nOut those girls Energy Era and boy do I have an ideal for you to deal with this deal is that you get the rash and\nThe whole way when you Jude my new one hundred percent white meat gamp Z five dollar bailout deal also get they'll make potatoes and gravy and biscuits ago can agree with this year deal against the bill ... do you have to go to games he soon to get the job is all white made five dollars up and there's only available for limited time deal [noise]\nThem can be like and you get your ... extra judgment as I said to me by\n[noise]\nMeaning the president I'm Roger Stern Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson spent part of his first day back on American\nSoil visiting the oval office in thanking the president for helping to secure his release after two years in Turkish captivity\nOnly want to thank goodness for really for four\nYears or so for\nA took off I Know\nPresident Trump toasting today's events during a campaign rally tonight in Richmond, Kentucky\nTo\nBrunson was arrested in Turkey for suppose or ties to terrorism here's denied that President Trump says we would be punishing ourselves to the U.S canceled arms sales to Saudi Arabia or with the disappearance of Washington Post columnist or ... show the in the Saudi consulate in these stumble\nFlorida governor Rick Scott has called up an additional five hundred National Guard personnel to deal with the fallout from hurricane Michael the storm took at least Eighteen lives rescue team in Virginia recovered the remains of a woman missing since she was swept away in flash flooding\nThe sports world mourning the loss of Jim ... of the Green Bay Packers hall of famer died today at the age of eighty three Bob mortality as look back at Taylor's career\nTaylor was the pull back for most to Vince Lombardi championship team do but I think sixties he teams will path back Paul Horning to create one of the most productive back fields in NFL history both thrive behind Lombardi staying power sweep\nTaylor was the NFL's most valuable player in Nineteen sixty two here five consecutive one thousand yard rushing seasons and played on for a championship squad Taylor also scored the first rushing touchdown and a Super Bowl back in Nineteen sixty seven Bob mortality Fox News\nAnd this is Fox News\n[noise]\nJust because it's cold custom Qadri word doesn't always mean it's going to get done right\nWhether you're starting a new home bills or driveway or want to add something sweet to your bully patio was folding construction and\nGo for salvation driveway ... indoor or\nYou get a free or somebody told me to eat for twenty seven oh five given ... head all day construction L.

[laughter] it's like a lemon out there he really is and like I remember I told you last week or a couple of weeks ago I'm worried about him by he plays hard he falls hard yeah he does\nMhm um and we were talking about in high school\nWhen kids are especially boys are looking for that attention right nobody goes to a baseball did you go to a baseball game ever at your high school\nNo like no one goes to watch baseball games you know why because they're being played during school right a lot of times they are\nYeah like it's six period there is a baseball game going on outside [laughter]\n... no one goes to baseball games at a good point\nYeah everybody goes to basketball games everybody goes to football games right even though baseball and soccer two of the sports the most kids start playing when they're young it doesn't translate when they get older because the fanfare in the notoriety comes from basketball and football\nWell I agree with the last part of that sure I think you grow up that's why it looked that is why soccer so much better in other countries those little kids grow up\nWhere they don't have any they don't have football well I'm saying soccer you know what I'm saying and other countries they don't it's ... it's not even an outlet well who right right right\nThat's right right but they grow up idolizing their favorite soccer starting they grew up wanting to be that and so I think when you're a young young kid we did the same thing when we're playing San ... football we always pretended to be our favorite\nAnd royal play right time Walter Payton yeah yeah I'm Jerry writes I called Jerry right or whatever [laughter]\nYeah that's what we do so\nYeah as it gets later in life I could see why someone might not go out for the baseball team because you can't get any shine for doing that the same way you could if you're a basketball or football player but I think that is for the the high school ranks I think\nIt's a way before that when you just grow up with the men's popularity of football and basketball wanting to\nBe that [noise] and and I say that to to to ... ... point he did everything that he was supposed\nTo do in baseball got drafted got pay you're guaranteed contracts but the lore and the shine of playing college quarterback it ... it in college sure at a top university out weighed\nThe\nProfessional status and the paycheck of major league baseball\n\nWell he's still not sacrificing I'm not saying all the actual prize I'm just saying like are the fashion ...

Thirteen to nothing at the time and\nYou could say oh it's not a big deal like they're under nine minutes to go in the second quarter is just Thirteen nothing if they don't pick that up they give\nA Georgia the ball at LSU what like thirty seven thirty eight yard line oh that's a big gamble by Edwards Ron huge gamble and it paid off man I Love when aggression gets rewarded like that\nAnd I think that was one of the bigger ... of the day and helped Ellis you beat George and the way they did\nYeah I'm In ... when you're in that position you just got to go for it right you don't want to be in

I'm like holy cow and wanting to make sure was them\nI'm like well did he just go deep and yeah he was looking to see the number and I was like whoa that's Josh Reddick [laughter] when's the last one I needed something significant man I'll look it on Twitter now people are sent me be a ... pictures of people scratching off lottery ticket or loser and loser on that so\nI have three out of shape that yeah it's a nice little metaphor for ah let me you know I I got to tell you you guys lose out also so there's no doubt\nThat I would've you know ... a share the wealth a little bit after one the twelve million dollars you know that do you oh you would have shared it absolutely why I'm well what percentage of ... says we talking about here\n[noise] maple syrup for every body what are you talking about house I don't even like maples well I guess you get like a cold are cash bay just then I get I guess you get nothing flying out on your private jet will do the show from Vermont together you know I'm ... I'm going to give you another quick story you said you like cold hard cash\nI was in Las Vegas I was living in Las Vegas do we get a national show\nI was doing the show from the casino okay it's Sunday Morning either either people that are gambling I have hung over or there's nobody around I mean it's pretty empty\nAnd this one guy is watch me do the show\nI mean it's like six Fifteen in the morning what say that we had no I didn't like it over the years there's other Sunday okay so long ago and he's watching me do the show I go to a break and he goes hey I'm a big cowboy fan I listen to you you're my favorite you're my favorite I\nI Love you hear such this dollar the silver dollar for good luck\nAnd we ... we got a call from the stadium after Alabama ... and it was recorded Davis oh wow seemed like a nice guy we had a stringer on site and we got we got a call from Rick one David seem like a nice kid\nBut yeah and not the best of luck tonight for people who didn't see it will be all over social media tomorrow you better believe it will ... going to be on the news I mean he gets down there and he takes them swings\nI don't know if you just said it already but I mean he looked like a UFC guy just on the ground just going for kidney shuts it was really really bad look\nI Would have to assume correct me if I'm wrong here already I mean the FCC office has to get involved in that when\nI was just about to ask you can still be suspended of for an upcoming game for something that happened in this one just because there were ... by the referees are wasn't missed by the referees\nAnd by the way to run Homer now by the Astros and make it a three run Homer and is now going to be seven to two I Believe uh this one is over I Believe that chemical just getting rock\nLike that [noise] yeah well all I can say about the Astros George Springer grew up in the\nTown next to me or unconscious in the playoffs yeah no it's not fair yeah I also get you jumping on the bandwagon oh I'm not to get big they smoked my team man they smoke they smoke to my team out of the playoffs the Indians didn't even have a chance against them\nDo you have the red Sox to as much as you hit the patriots Arnie\nI don't yeah I don't vote for the red Sox at all they they they bother me also I don't know about is the worst Red Sox fans or patriots fans they're they're both pretty obnoxious\nSo we've established in the show you hate the patriots you hate the red Sox you hate old women\nYou have pretty much everybody I mean is there anybody that you do like the Arizona Wildcats that aren't even likeable I mean I ...\nI was just talking to feel like the Bee Gees\nOkay All right there is that a good start a sure if it was Nineteen forty eight\nI Wonder what do you mean Nineteen forty eight are these are rock and Roll Hall of fame the beaches don't play the bad about the beach yeah\nTy Cobb is in the hall of fame oh I don't want to I was hot I don't want to have a segment on him\nA bully the Bee Gees release are really ... their their hall of fame musicians\nYeah I mean I could take 'em relieving\nShame on you so anyway back to a request Davis um yeah I I think maybe the FCC commissioner gets involved or or the office gets above ... we'll see what happens but certainly not a good look I wanted to read this one uh Mike in Jacksonville already did I just hear your co hard say\nThat he thought the season that the season the big was the best coverage before the season I mean up in North Carolina guy and then they see the guy but my God and what fantasy land is the SEC not far and away the best the Big Ten is average as grits\nIs what Mike said well Mike in Jacksonville pay attention because before the season every one\nThought the the the Big Ten was the best conference in college football they had five preseason teams ranked in the top Fifteen Ohio State Michigan Penn State Wisconsin and Michigan State also people like Purdue to be improved people thought Scott Frost would do big things\nAnd oh by the way we're proven wrong hey already you know what's great about on the fence of you or I Love it I was just saying oh what's great about the ... season versus the regular season what's that you actually learn stuff\nIn the season and all this stuff in the pre season doesn't matter because games are played and right now the SEC is the best conference in college football\nYes yes but I was out to your defense before the season um we did we did think that okay Michigan was going to be there are still good team but they were going to compete for the four teams Ohio State was about\nTo Michigan State was going to be a lot better at Penn State of course still with a good year even though they lost to Michigan State so I mean there are top heavy I disappointed in Wisconsin\nThey do this every year I get a couple of Windsor then next thing you know they've got to losses are three ... very very disappointed with them and then everybody else really average or below average I mean North West is okay and the ad is okay but they're not going to do a whole heck of a lot Ira\nYeah and you brought up the point earlier on Wisconsin is shame on us for believing in them with the quarterback play the way that they have I Know we'll talk about more next hour but you can't win a national championship when you play you can make a playoff quarterback for\nOur one in the books will come back we'll go over all the upsets will go back over the top twenty five maybe just rather go to join aside from where else Las Vegas are coming up also

E. C. championship game undefeated against Alabama they go down I'm just saying with Ohio State I feel like we've just put them in the playoff at Thirteen and no undefeated Big Ten champion\nI think they're going to have some real tough tests over these next couple of yeah they still they get you\nSo getting with one last there also I don't think that's going to be much of a problem Josh before we started the show had to get this out over Georgia Washington at Penn State falling I'm interested to see if you guys really think Texas is worthy of a top five slot\nUm which is I was looking at my I don't have them in my top four but ... and that's why I always like to do the top five if I was going to do my top five central Florida Texas or LSU might get that number five bed right now\nYeah I I think even amongst the one last teams are still some teams had a Texas LSU three top ten when when the game's happened that the teams aren't in the top ten now but they beat Miami Auburn and of course Georgia today\nMichigan by the way nice went over Wisconsin I probably have them as a one last team ranked ahead at Texas as well Saddam wouldn't however\nWe give them more what do we just expect them to win this do we just waiting for ... or ... more for them to do something stupid so we can criticize them or what\nI think people just have horrible I mean you look at last year so he comes in he was terrible they immediately go from five and seven to ten in three they doubled their when total is first year\nThey win ten games the following year by the way that was the year that they were one you know there was a bad force down call against the Ohio State that could have won the game they would have gone to the playoff instead they lose to Ohio State and they have down here last year but that happens when you lose all these guys I mean think about all the guys that we want a down your ask Nebraska yeah\nYeah and by the way to think about all the guys who lost you broke peppers Jake but I mean guys that are in the NFL doing big things right now\nUm and so I think people just don't like horrible they don't like the ... and then kind of when they lost to Notre Dame oh this proves that horrible is overrated Michigan well maybe Notre Dame is actually really good which we've learned over the last four or five weeks\nBy the way a little shut up to the UCLA Bruins fans out there they get their first victory of the season uh and not only do they get it they kick a little booty out there I was a you don't watch it I'm like oh my goodness you see always as like a a year's worth of pent up frustration\nI'm with her victory tonight so they get their first victory I betcha Kelly's or you know this is talk about you know get the monkey off your back thirty seven to seven and that was a decent county ... in the right I'm a tea or a data about but that that was a good victory by them obviously\nYup and by the way all those a sideline calisthenics have been working out did you have you seen this army is that in the midst of the losing streak\nA chip Kelly has them doing pushups and died jumping jacks and he he had him doing them on the sidelines so like\nThere'd be a you know it'd be a time out in the office would be meeting with the offensive you know coordinator whatever getting ready to go back on the field\nAnd there would be a line there's actual videos of it on Twitter you can search it uh so I think the hard love is paying off and yet thirty point when a dominant performance from UCLA hey Arnie get back yeah ... I just got to say they did way better than the Arizona Wildcats\nAll God's you'd think that doesn't bother me anymore and forty two\nDo you have a a hey hey the best thing that could have happened to you is that it happened yesterday and it didn't happen on the air and we didn't have to hear about it for three hours exactly Oh thank God for that forty\nTo detect it but I usually just get punished having to be on the air while my Wildcats boy that's why I'm so looking forward to basketball as a tourist I saw you got a great Arizona is supposed to be in basketball ...\nCounting on you they are I think completely under rated going into the year I keep an eye out freshmen brand in Williams from here in sunny Los Angeles I wasn't sunny today Wildcats will be better than people think J.

always want to give your child for what's going on with you that's that's the that's the college football playoff as if ... if you were going to have the college football playoff as is where you are right now\nWhat about what they do the brackets how they do like the last three teams in three teams that don't get it and they do all that stuff don't\nBut the most important teams that were focused on are the four teams that are in\nThat's what matters when you're doing your four teams that are in our ... if you're listening right now don't you wonder gee who's their fifth team I'm Wondering who the who they are just right around the only one only wonder that at the end of the season when I got screwed over\nWhat are they give us your top four and then the last one that you left out I Know they you sleep better to not leave oh lot better off if you haven't slept in week somewhere I haven't ever since I knew I found\nThat he wants to twelve million dollars a day five days since I've looked you understand if I had one twelve million dollars\nI'd have my health I could just do what I wanted I can go to war I wouldn't even have to talk I was\nI was going to buy a white Porsche or read Porsche at a black Porsche and Levi while I'm at my routed quickly and ... on the garage and still the snow drifts leave in July I think that's a good point I Would have bought my own island and

Stern\nHe works Monday Tuesday what does he not I don't know I don't you know doing what they do what to say I'm not a stern guy misspelled Tuesday through Thursday okay\n... oh that's fun I think that's really anyway our top five I got Alabama number one this though no surprise there Ohio State and number two though they weren't that impressed\nMe impressive and their victory over Minnesota Minnesota's difference is a good job of what the ... number three I was ready to drop the up to their quarterback got hurt and they struggle with that game um I have Notre Dame and number four [noise]\nSo that would be my top for right now [noise] considering everybody else\nSaw inside a West Virginia Washington Penn State [noise]\nWisconsin [noise] um so my number by team [noise] would be one of three teams either central Florida Texas or LSU okay or Michigan [noise]\nSo you give us our thought your top seven [noise]\nKnow five six seven eight my topic we asked for for you promised by you gave us saying okay there you go there or under sell over deliver there aren't like that you All right so my top for completely a little bit different than yours Alabama still number one until two is down I'm not worried\nNumber two I have the Notre Dame fighting Irish why way too high wait I Am not worried about them at all they were coming off too emotional when they're going on a by they weren't going to have a let down they headed today number three Ohio State I Love 'em and number four\nI have the LSU Tigers\nI Know there are five and no no no and yes listen if if it's only about being undefeated than let's put central Florida in half the who you beat matters right now LSU\nHas three wins against top ten teams they played for rank team's overall nominee ranked team funds and split so far any zero zero\nAnd so because of it [noise] LSU gets my for spot with Clemens in right on the outside are you in central Florida\nBy the way [noise] no I'm not I mean I it sounds a little anti central Florida\nI mean you know ... it's getting to a point where it'll last today by the one you got to appreciate the Nineteen once in a row and by the way I Would add is due out when you play the little sisters of the poor how much of how you know we we gave them all the credit\nIn the world because of Scott Ross last year\nThey've now one seven straight without Scott Ross maybe it wasn't Scott Frost maybe they just have a really really really good team Scott brushed it abroad that team with the rascals or should have stayed in central Florida because it's not working out in Nebraska I mean\nWow this is in ... you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have

what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you narrow piece when you are when people aren't going to

and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ...\nStates have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these wouldn't mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to but that's that's that's\nOne of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it or control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and talking to

including number two in Georgia\nFalling at number ... ... email us ... thirty six to sixteen number six West Virginia also victims they lose that Iowa State thirty to fourteen\nAll these conversations are so premature in college football where leading up to this last week it was hey hey could could an on beating Notre Dame be left out of the college football playoff and it's like\nNo [laughter] do you expect all of these other teams to remain on blemish or to have these sparkling resumes at the end of the season no Notre Dame going undefeated is a lock for the play offs and it's not just because\nThere was this a superior team or they've got this gauntlet schedule is just because these other teams are going to go down they're not going to have these on blemish records\nThat are going to knock Notre Dame outside all you got to do when you got to do is what al Davis used to preach which is just win baby jet winning and if your own blemish if you're playing power five teams unlike UCF you're going to be in the play offs\nAnd you're talking about being blemish Durham blemish one team really yesterday he got ... pretty good and then there are no longer undefeated and if you didn't believe that ... tigers before the game it may be tied to change your mindset has thirteenth rank LSU there for real they've got a huge win over number to Georgia in death valley an Saturday listen to this\n[laughter]\nSo they spent a pretty good thirty six sixteen and by the way now the titles right they go for real right now they have three top ten wins coming back after last week's list of Florida which I thought it was a blemish I thought maybe they're not for real but I think that's a real right now I think the road to the SEC championship has to include\nBaton Rouge Baton Rouge will be the spot\nWell they're right in the mix but that team named Alabama is still on schedule so [laughter] you got to get through that and it's also that they already what the laws yeah what's that\nThey've got ... Mississippi State they play next week and that Alabama so they got ready to test Sunday schedule a you know they'll probably split I don't see them being Alabama's anybody beating Alabama I really don't\nRight but that was the biggest game of the day and that takes Georgia's margin for error and makes it zero in terms of making the playoff they've got to run the table and when you look at the next three weeks Florida at Kentucky Auburn those are three ranked teams\nAnd then to get to the college football playoff you'd have to win the S. E. C. championship game which most likely will be against Alabama\nThat is tough to be able to run the table they gave themselves no margin for error but you look at LSU defense they played lights out they played excellent defense against the tough Georgia team and winning by twenty points man not only did LSU when they won convincingly\nYeah they'd be they'd be pretty good does tell you what another team that close off the list of the college football playoffs will be Penn State\nI mean I don't know how this team chokes at the end they can still I still like the LA charges of college football they they really are they can't they can't close it out at the end of the game in Michigan State Twenty one Seventeen at the end and now one last teams now with a chance to meet the college football players forget it\nImmediately lions couldn't hold onto the lead list another close game the second lowest of the year\n... they get this is twenty four and five and the last twenty nine games and those five losses a bit by a combined\nTwelve points you know they've got to be going crazy they're in a university park but they just can't close it up they can't do it\nNo it was an ugly game for Penn State and that's their second straight lost in the division in the big hands so they are beyond done and also West Virginia how about them and number sixteen number six team going down against Iowa State will Greer\nWho's the highest been hopeful a hundred yards passing a touchdown and a pick\nThat's all you had against Iowa State so you give that Iowa State squad credit they are giant killers and for West Virginia to get beaten down like that that could\nDo it for the big twelve you know their chances that like they have bullet you look at these teams is bullets in terms of hitting a target to get to the playoffs there just losing bullets one after another with Oklahoma going down last week now West Virginia going down good luck getting a team from the big twelve in the play off now\nWell I'll go one step further yeah it was a heck of a winning Ames, Iowa last night for coach Mike Campbell the second year coaches Iowa State thirty to fourteen of West Virginia but if you're a West Virginia right now the ... they got the rest of the way they got Michigan Wisconsin and Iowa remaining on their schedule so it doesn't look too good for West Virginia it really doesn't\nKnow no not looking good at all that was an ugly last it was that there were less than six minutes to go in the game West Virginia was down by fourteen points they're backed up way deepen their own territory third Nineteen they took it the lay of game\nWhere you should be in a hurry up off and just ... minutes to go you're damned fourteen point the lay of game not only were they bad they were disorganized\nThat was a complete meltdown by West Virginia last night but like you said give ... Campbell in Iowa State a lot of credit played great defense last night and to beat down and number six team in the country got to take your hat off to them\nI Do if I had I had I Would say to those early lip of the I'm happy for them happy for I was saying as well but I'm happy with that we have a big big football all day today and the national\nFootball league oh we're going to go through it's like a fine tooth comb beginning in about ten minutes because we have a lineup that second to none it really is we got prompts talk radio in this hour an hour number two up on a barrel betting and our number three\nUs center stage with knows pigs and Alex Rodriguez of the NFL inside of a Fox Sports radio it doesn't get any better than that it really does and by the way as always will live for the guy called Fox Sports radio studios and you can get to us\nOn Twitter at the show and always show or I did for a minute if as our well by phone if you choose at age\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine but get this no changes will be made that's next\nChampion theory goes off\nYour social media home they always say\nFollow us on Twitter during the October mad that this isn't easy anymore when\nFox Sports radio\nRather here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy than a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we're in another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide image or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler buying experience what do you buy new or use\nAnd withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by there also more likely to enjoy a faster\nBuying experience by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy it more confident card by experience some features not available in all states\nIf you suffer from E.

I Want to see which defense shows up today for the Steelers when they gave up forty two points to patch homes and company they give up twenty seven points to fits magic you know and and the Tampa Bay bucks\nYou give up twenty six at home to the ravens and they could have had a lot more so I I they haven't played great defense and last week they did so I don't know which defense shows up today against the bangles if it's a good defense I Would certainly expect the often to put up enough points when I just don't know if that good defensive the Steelers it's going to show up\nI have a surprise to you oh you live out his game ... well angles on one and a half\nOh Andy you are you're making strides man you are making strides you got spread of the game you know my heart is a little bit of\nYou know what though I got it all I got over an under a plus fifty and a half and I got Bengals minus one and a half so I mean you know I'm I'm doing you've taught me well I got attack I gotta I gotta give the right the rise\nAnd amazing thing it's just outstanding yes\nGuys they sounded shadow your age or New York\n[noise]\nWe want to hear Paul rationality you can feel hottest topics or\n\nSomething we liked it called Bronx talk radio hosted by the great Danny Kaye\nSomeone gave me an acid reflux tablet I got to deal with you too [noise] if you're a chili dogs when I was up to chip chip alright\nI wrote this out chip chip or a good job Jim Kelly what is your first game was he got as far as the blue when All right that's pretty crafty I what do we think about that\nI finally gate losing ... ... it's not going to be pretty rural when\nThat's pretty good listen to know that the starting point poachers had robbed the bears\nIn Berkeley you got to love it that the ...

he didn't say anything\nThat was an accurate they just kind of giving you a couple of those UC of jabs I gotta get your UCF T shirt that's what I Want to do I wanna grow\nWithout ... here's the thing then let me just say this real quick linked up that I have no thing against the little guys I don't like ... this isn't to relive the glory days or anything like that Andy but when I played\nHigh school football I played at a school they'll is Sal lions okay and the south bend schools there were at like five public schools in the south bend area\nAnd we would go against this other school named pen and paper and was basically all these different South Bend schools all like morphed into one\nSo you had to hand which is the up on everybody that was a smaller school in the south bend area I ate and I just buy them and uh because I was like in the little guys school\nAnd so I I Love the underdog I Love the little guys taken down the big boys I live for that and the college basketball tournament\nSo don't act like I'm this oh no little guys get about a year it's all about the resume it's nothing personal whatsoever would use the F\nIt is literally no emotion it just drives me crazy when the bad logic is flowing like wine when it comes to use the F you don't apply the same harsh\nStandard that you do for power five schools with UCF you should I Wish they were evaluated integrated the same way based on their resume based on who they play in who they beat and they simply aren't\nWhen that ... me and and the voters don't do that but this UCF came into the rankings yesterday tenth of the country really\nWere times I mean so so you you can they go all the statements you want but honestly when the voters come to vote a pie and\nDo a college in the polls come out tomorrow UCF was tense last week they want a nail biter down by Fifteen Years state the methods they won by a\nPoint the estate Memphis I don't see them being knocked out of the top ten years they especially of well what happened on the college football season anyway so they're ... because you'd argument makes you ... you just statements that argument because a lot of sense but when it comes to voting I think many of these voters just lived as UCF\nHas the same type of schools in Oklahoma or Oklahoma State of West Virginia they really they\nOh I think they do not all but I think some when you have and under no team like two years ago western Michigan got a lot of heat right because they ... they weren't included in the playoffs and people look at that say well we're undefeated these are the teams we play we can't help it does to schedule we ... were undefeated will not getting the respect with the way do that's what happens\nThey don't they don't look at it that way you had\nUCF was undefeated you had Washington ahead of them with the loss you at Penn State ahead of them with the last ... Texas had at them with the loss okay you're probably going to have both Michigan and LSU leap frog UCF\nSo that's the whole thing like the other part is ... ... ... if they were if they had\nTrue respect for UCF being undefeated they would be ranked higher than they are they wouldn't have one last teams ahead of them there should be one last teams added them because they have better resume remote yet to remind\nMe that this this this argument this discussion what we're having right now is a mute point because look they don't play the teams to warrant the respect that they should get that's all we're saying right yeah slice somebody\nPut you see a play somebody out of your league because you'll league is not as strong as the SEC or the Big Ten or twelve ... that's just well this is fact it's almost ... argument that we're going around and around and around well there are good football team I grant you that there are a good football\nTeam in the conference are they playing the a C which is not a top notch conference and the silver\nLuck good like look at what LSU is done this year\nDo you think UCF would have the same outcome\nPlaying Miami at a neutral site\nAt Auburn double digit underdogs taking down Georgia okay those are three teams that were ranked in the top ten at the time that they played um do you think that UCF would have won blemish on his resume I Know people are All right I I you know how you look\nThey haven't played a team with a winning record until yesterday and we're propping up UCF is if there's somebody it's crazy the way out of it is a real quickly Andy\nI hate that we're not looking at twenty eight seen in a vacuum because that's what we should do look at South Florida same conference they were ranked twenty third\nHeading into this weekend\nOkay why are they lower for anybody who say well UCF should be higher why don't you say that about South Florida why don't you say that about NC State who's undefeated teams\nThat are university or into that and I don't see that is undefeated five and oh\nRight right so we're leading heart you know those schools were undefeated\nRight what's the argument there because they don't play anybody either and they should be ranked higher the truth is UCF should be ranked lower like in in the state like South Florida like his Cincinnati if you play someone and beat someone of note then you should be a top ten team\nI couldn't agree more and I think it's almost a waste of breath to discuss why a team on that level should be I just put on the same level as it Alabama or LSU it just just put it this way but UCF\nOr as South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot\nDennis hello hello again guys weeks six of the NFL

the same way but over under a hundred and forty nine and a half total penalty yards in Steelers the bangles Brian\nOh dude that is a great line man because you think about past interference is the first thing I think of Shirley how many yards you can chew up with just a couple of pass interference penalty [noise]\n\nI'll take the over today I don't really have reference for this but I'll take the over\nI think it's an easy but it's got to be over really especially with Antonio Brown ... schools will\nAll right All right we'll see if it's your I'm curious if it goes over to thirty nine from

day in Boston right now the New England area ah as I'm looking right now at the\nHouston Astros in Boston Boston Red Sox right now of one o s used at least the series one oh and then of course in Fox borough you have the chief in town taking on the patriots those are one of those big days in a New England area uh they actually have the patriots favor by for even though we know what the chiefs have done we know how ... so uh we're\nGoing to be joined right now where as well as well as he ready what's going on gentleman ... we're we're on you already know how I feel\nI'm I rattle off all the boss movies the departed ah around the town good Will Hunting good Will Hunting you know\nYou don't want to sleep or actually Nineteen Ninety\nSix let me go let me ride oh see I was All right we're going to say that no but I was going to think about the good so the bride I remember that is there any more of them are missing\nAh ah what's the what's the one I'm\nWith uh the the ... the younger brother although I'm baby gone gone gone good one that's a good one so they got ... may be gone and then they got going girls between the two of them yes they do a lot of gone between those two brothers lot of things last with the Affleck rather say about\nA gentleman it's a huge game tonight dare I say most important game of the season\nI think you're going to say that next week and then we got we got [laughter]\nBut however for this week yes you can go ahead and say well\nFor him to keep pace with Miami in the division is is a huge game\nYeah huge game but I think it's going to say so much about both teams for the chief it's going to mean that they have the real deal patch it's going to be more of the same you know it's going to be what we expected but let me let me throw that out there now this that might be rendered\nUseless because of how polish homes is but quarterbacks under twenty five in Gillette\nPatriots or twenty three you know\nThat's just that's the ... but you don't know what I Would say ... to that I Would say that\nEveryone's heard that the last few days and then I Know Andy Reid is hard and think you know it doesn't\nMatter it doesn't matter because the the thing and I'm leaning towards the patriots and is although I hate the patriots [laughter] I'm leaning towards them because it is something different to go up to ... to ... a Fox borough and play\nAnd the ... gonna defensively they're going to make them uncomfortable\nOkay they're going to take something away from him and although he is dynamic and he's talented the last couple of games he's shown that he's human that is true and the patriots have a way of really bringing Superman down to Earth Day or the kryptonite of the NFL\nThey find your best thing and they they eliminate that or at least neutralize it and say hey you got the beat us some other way um but I Will say this I I just wonder if that she used to have too much off for instance we\nGot to talk about this with the rams rand's haven't really had to feature tiger early in the backfield as much as they did today and then when they were we needed to do what they were able to do what he goes forward two hundred yards I'm Wondering if Kareem\nHasn't even been utilized enough because of the the passing and then you know drop it off ... dropping off to a tropical to do this do that and it's been working there so much off it's it's so potent what did they get down there and it's cold they start Corinne hunting you a bit I mean I think there's I think they're going to see more Fremont featured I I'm not worried\nAbout the all fits will\nI'm I'm worried about Kansas City defense now if you're in the air berries doubtful and so it was just in Houston their best past Russia\nThose two players missing off that defense\nMakes Kansas City a different de fit into now you can't\nPut Eric Barry one on one with ... now you have to give him safe deal over the top you got to put a corner on them now you're out of place so now you ... you have the you know the Edelman in these guys the Hogan\nNot forget sunny Michel ... shells playing as an all pro you you're talking about you know\nSee so many similarities in him and James Corner in the way that they both kind of came out of nowhere and the plane out of their minds he gave rejuvenation to their ground game for sure I'll give\nYou that because also the way that the patriots work when you have a son who was show and then also you still have white in the back uh back to where you just have so many different ways that they'll do all of a sudden drop something you didn't even think about that there are some new guy you know say hey like\nThe credit to the patriots that they'll say you know what it's not even shells working today we'll throw in Fifteen screened passes today yeah or they'll do something that you did most teams do do because they'll just say if it ain't broke don't fix it and they've been able to do that for years they'll find that one thing that works well Julian Edelman you to death\nOr I you know what I'm interested to see it will see more Josh Gordon is a lot fewer receptions over the last couple of games\nIf you'd ... given hamstrings okay that's a formidable weapon for Kansas City to worry about not having used in a very\nIn the lineup for Kansas City is going to be tough for them to go to Ross Perot and beat New England is just about a month so then you're you're you're picking New England I'm going to pick New England on this one I always pick against New England [laughter] ah yeah I learned my lesson\nYou that we've all learned our lesson there are so I'm with you I'm with you on this one will I think it's going to be up and down the field on both sides it's just going to be about who has more often than who can get that stop you know come late third quarter I think it's going to be a great great game gentleman\nIt should be a great what you would you want to jump off in a put the cheesecake\nBrunch on this or something who they are you going with the chief yeah okay we're going next week so next week yeah we'll\nOr whoever wins the other person gets the other person uh well I don't know what you get you get the same thing every time every time so yours is easy to get our time to think about what I Want\nYeah and you let me know All right we'll do that I'm a little nervous now because oil you here next week\nI'm here every week okay every Sunday I'm here I'm a little nervous I'm not going to live because\nAs you just mentioned it's the patriots and they ... I've ... the story\nTold before I'm telling you but it's already we're already locked in on the way they do you let me go ahead please order right now [laughter]\nI'm just calling or order\nThem hey I'm a pick it up a next Sunday 'cause I have it ready for me it around one fifty\nNow it's weird for me 'cause now I'm In a position you're going to be here for and against him at the same time it's very difficult for me\nI could imagine that's difficult uh Patrick ... has been funny he has been special to play with we were talking about him yesterday um Saturday show myself in the apartment where 'cause we were obviously it's more focus on college football 'cause it's Saturday and we were going back to the EPA gave me had I forgot the final score to something ridiculous like sixty three to fifty seven\nA Texas that going up against Oklahoma maker may feel ... and when my hosted by seven hundred and some odd crazy yards\nAnd he had like six seven touchdown and it was just absurd man and then you and it's one of those I I think that was a moment where\nMaybe the case of like you know 'cause everybody\nWe were talking about the other quarterbacks within that people were not bringing up Patrick ... could throw the ball man when they got rid of Alex Smith I was like wait whoa they want to go down with\nThe ball he only Fifteen attempts at passing\nEleven of those ended in the sec that's crazy so a Tennessee Titans you got to do better\nMan got ... just lets you know what those credit the titans there's most anybody in the country is talking about then\nWe talked about the Tennessee side for probably a total two minutes today and that's true that was impressive that was impressive so that's accredited him that they've come up when we got two minutes out of us as we can versus maybe usually about Fifteen seconds a you know why I enjoy it I was I'm\nPleased with today a that is the tape is Marie ... twenty four Russians and you can maybe even say the\nEntirety of the Vikings and that they knew to give him the ball and they rush for thirty two attempts and a hundred and Ninety five yards as a team of specifically with Marie twenty four Russia's hundred and fifty five yards a touchdown ah was able to even you know grab another ... few yards but my point is\nLook Kirk Cousins definitely can win games what do you can also heard from China too and if you're able to run like this if you're able to get your deepest going and being as good or even even if it's you know three quarters as good as we thought it was supposed to be a and you did this without even having dealt with cook\nYou know which would give you that kind of that one two punch that you'd be looking for so I appreciate the way the tables Murray ran today for the Vikings gave them a one two punch with Kirk Cousins passing the the ...\nAnd then obviously able to run with him so I was I was very very impressed with him Murray today and the Vikings often specifically to run again\nI was impressed with the the Miami Dolphins are more notably Brock\n... you know I look man almost had a few more minutes later on guide wire alert\nCame in twenty eight for forty four three hundred and eighty yards three touchdowns he did have to pick what he led the team to victory thirty one point they went in overtime against a vaunted bears defense there was one tops and the league\nThey gave up no sex which means he was getting the ball off so shout out to ... welcome back let's see if he can continue to do it\n... back but from what ... of security\nI mean he was cut by the browns so yeah\nThey do have to go get ... that's the game and they needed and got the victory so and by the way to give you a score here um with the Astros and the red Sox it was just too oh when I looked up and you and I started talking and now all of a sudden it's to to ash rows of tied to stay up I Can't say I think it's the bottom of the second uh\nOf course the actually the series one oh and I'll say something to us all day to day just a\nRounded out no robo Bible\nOr but speaking of holdouts who they have they not that a commercial with him in there and judge Aaron Judge is like seven foot three and ... is like five four seven foot I may not exaggerating\nBut no no no I don't think he's into which they say that John than you and your giant\nHe's six a holiday said first of all slowly role player whether I thought you were six six eight home Boyd how did you grow how tall are you a five ten cool as far as I don't speak on us soil\nHey hey you giant over there but just shut up yeah some of us here five eight and a happy so yeah take\nThat are five six and a half now who is that when you don't worry you'll you'll listen your shoes\nOh okay I'm Sorry what Roger Six Flags that's true
