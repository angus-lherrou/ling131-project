Steve Jonah stocks going coming to you live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go get a guy go dot com or called eight hundred nine four seven out of the only hard part figuring out which way is easier so so Sunday Night Football is under way we've got the bangles at the chiefs\nI haven't the chiefs getting to Sunday night games in a row\nTelling you to talk about calling their shopping NBC called their shop before the year he didn't know they were going to be this good\nI think anyone who and they did a practice tape of Patrick Rome's anyone who saw him during the course of\nA the oh jeeze many camp training camp\nThat people kind of knew what was coming I I had a chance to talk with Peter ... a horse read it fell network does some stuff for Fox as well on the sidelines\nUm and it was on good morning football he had the opportunity to go spend some time out there this past summer and wasn't when I saw last week I just said hey man\nYou call it right out of the gate I said you were the one that that basically was standing on your soap box screaming for a patch or home saying this kid's going to be an MVP Kennedy and his first year starting and he's he's been just that and it and I think the more impressive thing is is he hasn't slowed down\nHe is he's had some a little bit of ups and downs for him but he constantly finds ways to move the football and produce and and give it to him a chance\nYou know who I Know I didn't see tape on patrimony who's that Ryan pays\n[laughter] so let me\n[laughter] so so let's go back to that for who they take instead what was the uh the guy's name um\nOh is it a lot of what the hell's that guy's name or was it grossed men as well\nThat was that was way before way before you know I heard gross and used to have a hard time making weight you know\nI'm a ... or ... I have I talk\nTo you I Would ... you would get fined a weekly because he couldn't way the amount that they wanted him to weigh it was like two twenty five to thirty but he couldn't couldn't get dumped\n... David Anderson told me a story I hit the gross Mintz former teammate in Washington David Anderson told me a story that gross when we get into the huddle and if he didn't like the play is just like now I Want to do this just go deep [laughter]\nI don't know how to play any advice but Shannon's liked him so much that they were cool with it because he was such a good guy everybody at a fun time with it so it helps to produce and he was a guy to slant\nYeah um now that yeah we will touch on [laughter]\n[noise] or whatever that was from Mr Boesky on Sunday we'll talk about that at some point um but I Do want to ask you about Andy Dalton in primetime games\nWhat do you make of this man psychology of a quarterback he continues to not produce in primetime games he's got another opportunity to try and prove the skeptics wrong in a primetime spot against the Kansas City defense that you can put up points and get your yards against because teams have done it all year long\nCincinnati is often says plenty good enough but what do you make of Andy ... and not just dandy Dalton Marvin Lewis is struggling primetime games\nOkay quickly there on the road for this prize I'm gay for starters and Kansas City is or at least was I think one of the last week the number one third doubt defense in the legs so look let's not paid it like it's that much of a lay up for them okay well a combined it makes the story sound better or the other end of the troops in the way we don't deal with facts here\nRight so I think what happens is and this is human nature I mean you tell me if if you have an experience this in your life\nLike the more time something happens that people start to identify you as something\nThat the more apps you are to sit there and say maybe I Am that you know maybe I Am the guy that can't ever get the job done in prime time or I just I I Can't figure it out\nIt it's hard especially in today's age for not hear what's being said about you and that's why what's so many players talk about block yeah social media or block it out the north on the outside\nThey really do have to disconnect because it's so loud and it's so noisy that you can't help to subconsciously start to think those thoughts and to play in the NFL especially as a quarterback and to play a high level consistently you\nHave to have the utmost confidence and you can't allow all that stuff that gets you so\nUm I think for him it's happened enough in his career that it feels like a monkey on his back it's like the weight that he's just he's bearing every single time he goes out in this scenario\nAnd you know it just he needs to figure out a way of either having that you know big time performance where he gets a monkey off his back\nOr it needs to be an instance where it happens a few times his team helps them out and then maybe he starts to feel more confident from that they can build off of a couple of wins that are really more maybe led by their team more so than him\nBecause he's not a bad quarterback and he said you said pretty good years you could win games of anti don't and you just can't win postseason games are games that a lot of people watch that\nThat's [laughter] and it didn't he can win those games I\nHonestly feel like their team has not played as well around him either\nThey melted down that that playoff game against the Steelers was a ... and told them out to I was on the air right afterwards and it was the most fun post game show I've ever done because I've never seen a team melt down like that not only just with playing making\nBut with just undisciplined personal bond has perfect may as well and had a machete on him in that game he was out to hurt people um so yeah it's it's not completely on him but he's the quarterback so he's going to get both of the blame\nYou know what else was there for that game was at a one age of ... oh that's right yeah he was with the bet your brother in law jihad ankles then yeah and I remember asking him about it and he was just because I've never seen anything like that [laughter] I looked at me with his eyes as wide as you can imagine\nBecause I've never seen anything like that before my life you know where an epidemic came from Green Bay so they they want a Super Bowl that do play I use the F word in Green Bay [laughter]\nUm yeah I was going to be a vegan writing out YDF Wisconsin so it's this whole thing was\nMan once you got into certain guys heads\nLike a guy like bought says perfect\nThey it's just there's there's no turning off that switch and and the other fortunate borders you still see him play the way he does it getting it's getting it's getting by the way she has because he hasn't changed is is way of playing but\nAnyway you go about it he just said look though that's kinda how you know that team rides you know it's it's really led by their players that it's pretty loose there's not like some hard disciplinarian when you talk about more of an Lewis and as much as that strength at times it also could be their their their downfall\nI can just imagine AJ Hawk look at her it's like when you're in a at a at a table and a couple of starts fighting out of nowhere and you start looking at the show like what the hell's going on here what is happening here I could just imagine age losing his mind like why do I do I'd rather not play that have to deal with this\nAt his father or a Brady coin Jonah stocks or Fox Sports radio comedy you live here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios do we get out on time a few bubble I'm coming up next year on Fox Sports radio there is a a prestigious list are a quarterback did something\nThat is hardly ever been done in the history of the NFL and the results might surprise you find out what we're talking about next year on Fox Sports radio\nThirty two teams have a shot [laughter]\nOnly one will be champion\n... season starts nah\nWe get the ball in the men's only go day\nSports radio I'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or sticking an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor help me find them back home ... in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read a review the check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you go home at ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nOkay they don't it's not literally a pair of gold paint all I did it like a little like Sharm oh then I don't even want it I Want the gold parents no not at odds were hanging too much on the ... the pointed it when you're hanging out much at all trust me by adults hands on\n[laughter] it doesn't matter what the record as they were still going to get everyone's best shot they're still living at Penn State's best shot\nThe ... states best shot I'm the only thing now is that they ultimately do control their own destiny which they did by the way they did before Ohio State lost because they're they're one last came out of conference so it didn't matter\nUh okay so now that we're done with your terrible answer ... radio you're ... and asked me are terrible a cliff [laughter] ... right there we go\nUm we get a little bit of a some game show music here on Fox portrayed it we have a live studio band this is a high budget program I Know what you're thinking well\nUh you know and you know yeah I Know what you're saying and it is ah this and this is Sunday night radio these guys are just mailing it in a hold on quite contrary my friend this is a high profile high budget radio show we have a studio band\nAnd attendance [noise] or that is an actual band that's not a recording we didn't just hit a button in between both those swiping on tinder oh this is an actual band in Studio right now here at ... radio or should bumble um Astrid bumble\nAnd so so here we go Brady Drew Brees through his five hundred career touchdown yes I Am Andrea career touchdowns as the saints beat the Baltimore Ravens erode when for New Orleans\nDid you know that Drew Brees is now just the third quarter back in NFL history to beat\nAll thirty two teams in the NFL [noise] can you name the other two [noise]\nSo you you kinda pose this question before the break and I gave you an answer and then after I gave you the answer I thought about it and I was like oh I don't know if that's going to work right so poverty is the first one that comes to mind [noise]\nI was thinking about how Britain I kept going All right I'm going to the teams of thinking about unless you beat the Stevens beat that seems to be just to [noise]\nAnd so if so Tom Ridge is not one of these quarterbacks but what team is poverty not be ... [noise]\nThe New England patriots [noise] exactly [noise] so it couldn't be Tom Brady 'cause we put for one team so then I Am from that\nI I basically came to me I got an an EMT ten minutes notice it's gotten to know it's gotta be\nQuarterbacks were ... caliber that that moved to eat right so they were great one place and then maybe they went one or two other places or they just want to one of the\nCan I give you a hint real quick nuts Peyton Manning abrupt okay well I was gonna say it's definitely not my Tom ... since we're talking old school Ohio State football it's one of the threats on to brag and Ohio Ohio State school in times that go to Ohio State did drink all want to do I keep it in the Columbus area Columbus\nRight next to double in case you know I'm All right uh so yes your correct Brady Quinn Brett Farr Peyton Manning and now Drew Brees are the only quarterbacks in NFL history that the beaten all thirty two teams in the NFL\nHere's some other names that are that surprised me on this list so obviously Tom Brady can't because Tom Brady plays for the patriots that he's never had the opportunity to play for the patriots until this off season when ... probably trade them\nAaron Rodgers is another one clearly can't beat every team because he's only played for the Packers same with Ben Roethlisberger you know who's mixed into this bunch and this order back\nHe's the only team this quarterback has not beaten is the Miami Dolphins right I Want you just walk Penn State think about a longtime quarterback from Penn State cherry cones bingo\nBingo who knows they're being quarterback football or you think about this\nBy the way it's not even multiple teams if you have to play for one see him in each conference but that wouldn't be the case for Peyton so it's kind of interesting yeah 'cause because he was he just had the opportunity to play a nuts and a sea teams where he was able to beat them all\nOkay let me ask you this more impressive feat right Drew Brees Brett Farr and Peyton Manning beating every single team in the NFL or me cheating\nTo beat my mom and a horse shoes tournament years ago to family [laughter]\nProbably do [noise]\n[noise]\n... veterans are proven tough to performance temperatures of a hundred and forty degrees\nForty below zero because when you started extreme conditions you could start an everyday

five in his own territory in overtime\nDust giving the ball back to below Brian who tried to go for the tie earlier\nAnd they escaped with uh when they're first one of the season there than they beat the Dallas Cowboys\nIn a game that I wasn't that the did did it go to Jason ... played it safe and then they completed a long pass and then they kicked ... if I'm not mistaken I Believe she okay so there is that once they escape with that one\nThen they beat the Buffalo Bills a week ago because Nathan Peter men forgot which team he played for late in the game and through a pick six and then they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday because ... was awful and the team is melting down around him\nBut here is how bad the Jacksonville Jaguars were on Sunday\nThe Sean Watson was so bank tough\nThat he took a bus to the game and still out playboy portals [laughter] biased because he couldn't fly because of all the injuries he was dealing with now you can relate to some of these injuries you've gone through similar pain that the Sean Watson has gone through tell us what it's like\nIt's it's pretty miserable I'll just full disclosure I had torn Carlin Bruce\nDribs when I was in Kansas City and it it happened from ah I forget where I got sacked by but I as I kind of tried to turn away to escape\nUm when he hit me he landed on top of me and the ball landed like up in my chest they're like why don't need my shoulder park God and so I think I ended up um tear and some of the college in between my ribs from that like the way we fell\nAnd so after that point it was difficult to breathe it was difficult to sleep because I mean for anyone who you know first off I'm not a good sleeper as it is but then when you're trying to like sleep on your side or you only have one side you could sleep on because it hurts to breathe and it's it hurts the way your body adjusts when you're on your side\nUh it was terrible so um they had to shoot it up with no ... they just ... like directly injected into my chest before games now that I'm well ... the shah was fine I mean I I'm used to that kind of stuff [noise]\nUm just just with you know you sometimes you're thinking you're taking ... to get through you know certain games the federal how your body was feeling um but I Would take that before games and then I had literally got a cocktail of\nIndecision flex raw and fight it in just every single day I I Would take that just to be able to get through the end of the season 'cause I was so banged up between my ribs I added a poster a labor of terror and like everything else but I just wanted to finish the sees as bad as things were in two thousand twelve\nAnd I were pamper 'em taken that cocktail and that was like the only thing that could that knocked me out at that point a which which is not a good habit by the way a those three things mixed together as a terrible idea but it was like the only thing that would help me be able to get through the season at that\nPoint um and the swelling on the plane is is a real thing there was a a documentary that was done so every year the NHL does this or that let's go live to our NHL insider we use him once or twice a year at most because it is the NHL Roberts they still do that when a classic on okay\nI'm ... years ago they did the winner classic I think's Roberts will ah will catch here is the winner of last year who cares um ... it's ... I have no idea\nWhy aren't they playing one of Notre Dame stadium\nIf it's not Jack johnson I got no interest in it All right how 'bout that that's called loyalty to singer or know that guy saying some talking about your brother in law for the penguins um yeah I think he got there late or they're not gonna when everyone's Blackhawks Notre Dame said you know it is\nA while ago that\nIt'll be fine I Can't wait to not watch 'em so [laughter] so it's not a Fox game fighting chance no or go through our hockey to me it's like NBC I don't want to burn that bridge to but I there was a a part in this part of burn like there were ... they were there was the lead up to that winter classic years ago and I believe was the penguins and the capitals\nAnd a guy for the penguins took a puck office face off his cheek you didn't break his cheek bone or anything but he was a little bit swollen and\nHe got on the plane and he looked over at Sidney Crosby and it was on film because they were doing a documentary and Crosby was like and I forget the guy's name he said\nI I think it was banned in love with joy it was bad this guy named Ben loved Joe which is probably a porn name but this guy bend love joy was on the plane and Crosby looks over them goes Ben\nHis entire face swelled up because he was on the plane so I I I Wonder how like how excruciating it was the first time maybe watch and\nI'm like what what do you think went into the decision to not send them on a plane and how soon before they knew this guy's got to go by bus or a we've got to pay\nBefore he would go any further than into that decision if that is the decision that you're making don't you think you just shouldn't be playing well that's my\nPoint okay so so at what point did the conversation go from yeah this is really bad to\nHey gray and greyhound operate from here to ah [laughter] is that about ... like no way\nFirst off I Would much rather travel or twelve hours on a pimped out like tour bus all yeah then fly and if it took me two hours I Swear to you it sounds crazy that's how big of an impact I think flying I was in your body is an athlete I'll just I'll go that far just I've got messed up the at all is Frank injury\nEvery single time we traveled you would be the worst pain how achy an arthritic it'd be and then just ... you know it'd be swollen barely fit into my shoe and that was you know ... years after I had initially injured it but that's the impact that um you know fly house and your body 'cause you're in that pressurized cabin and it just\nI it ends up playing I'm a medalist any injury that you've got\nYeah I just I I Wonder how close they were to just not having them play as opposed to take a bus to get to the game very very bizarre a alright outbreak when Joe and it's not clear Fox Sports radio would come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios coming up next\nUm we're very very confused as to what the hell one quarterback was trying to do on Sunday we will tell you who that is next year on Fox Sports radio\nThey leave in ...

I. I learned that growing up if you're ever shooting hoops\nMake sure the last shot you take before you walk off the court whether or not is getting dark out or not you make it you need to go in and good vibes and I'm Sorry I had a lot of sleepless nights then huh thank you I really you know the I guess that's the great thing about working with Brady Quinn\nIs a you know I scratch his back and he stabs mine it is really just that just a great guy handling a guy yeah not him not any more [laughter] getting cut off\nYou know no more love for me I found it really inappropriate now\nThat I'm not sure where you're going to lie but\nJesus is coming out twelve minutes from now or whether ... likes it or not right how's that so uh so he will be making an appearance but I'm going to throw an idea\nThat you that I think is actually going to work\nAnd and get this this is such a good idea that I'm shocked that nobody else has come up with this idea yet I'm so everybody assumes what what would you consider the worst statistic for a quarterback in the NFL\n... like the most overrated one yes ah to me it's the quarterback rating because most people don't even know how it's comprised so people will throw it out and there'll be like oh he's got like a\nHundred and something quarterback reading and there was like well what's the highest rating what what what how do you calculate that so to me that's the stupidest one when people like to use that um but they're they're all pretty bad yeah if you don't watch the film\nYeah I'm like like interceptions I think are are a little bit over rated from time to 'cause they don't can be misleading yeah and I actually through the id out to you what you are you were ... I don't actually believe you responded to this idea I had appreciate it but I actually through the U.S that the idea out to you how about we do Brady box score where you will defend quarterbacks\nWho get ... where there's an interception\nBut it's not really your normal interception a lot of the ... about the quarterbacks fault yes I ... and it's a way to defend quarterback until the dying and here they are the most prominent position on the field they deserve the most respect and they deserve to be defended the most um I have another one that I Would like to throw out you look Sarah okay this is the brand new stat\nI'm I'm working on a copyright for um\nThis is the should have been an interception stat I'm\nShould've I ended up under section ... is this relating to a certain quarterback\nOkay because ... and the reason I bring this up is right now as it stands Sam ... Arnold is the NFL leader in interceptions this season\nRight hey Mitch Trybulski should be leading the NFL in ... [laughter] okay [laughter] because he\nWas not good on Sunday and they almost like I I wondered after he missed\nHis fifth or sixth open wide receiver on an errant throw a sometimes out of the flat or sometimes\nGuys it it you see quarterbacks make the completion all the time I saw Jared golf you know throw the same flag route to the corner the ends on on the left side to Brandon cooks in place the ball beautifully yet Mr basically was intercepted when he had Anthony Miller open\nI almost wonder if there was something wrong with him what did you make 'em ... performance and how he's progressing so far this season\nYeah I think he's been a consistent and I think that's something that you're going to see 'em one ... when you see a young quarterback a guy still technically in his first sixteen games starting you know based last\nYou're in and you know combined with this year didn't play a lot in college we always talked about that but it but I think it shows in it and how inconsistent he is\nAnd he went up against one of the better teams in the NFL you know statistically whether or not you can make a good argument for New England one thing is for sure you know situational a third down red zone they're as good as anyone and you know that was you know one of the determining factor I think today but um I I think he's\nFrom the pocket\nTo me watching them right now as his first reads not there\nIt's is his percentages of of completing that past go down significantly if he has to go to a second and third read from what I watched him\nHe tends to throw the football a little bit less accurate he tends to not want to stay in the pocket of will miss that next guy who was open\nUm so you know if I was that if I was a defense plan against the man I wouldn't place much man to man because typically when you see teams play man to man\nYou know where you're going with the football and you're already committed to that decision I'm that guy getting open and you can throw him open if he's just working one on one depending on where the defender is if it's zone danger typically going to work more through a progression\nBecause there might be a few Ralph's in that ... in that concept that are they're so like the first and second you know push just supposed to look based on that covers they might not be there might be the third option that might be your best option\nUh I just how do you fix somebody who's not accurate because\n... I see and make these throws in in guys are open man ... why it's not about separation or anything like that guys are getting open there's opportunities there to make plays and it's almost like he would rather pulled a ball down and run than trust his arm and ... it seems like he's he's almost scared to pull the trigger\nHow do you fix that like is that just something you work on you continue to practice or at this stage you kind of are what you are\nWell I think as far as how he's program bright you saw the rushing touched down on what is the third six when he's scrambled around and then ... and the funniest when the end zone like that's a great highlight it's cool that he can do that he's not going to be able to do that again\nI mean ... those plays probably only come once just rent it and then one and then defense is doing allow you the sack you the next time you try to do that 'cause they figure out different ways of rushing you but uh I I think when it's in your DNA like that you know you become and who have I always compare it into right now what older guy if I could barely ... to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "22"}
