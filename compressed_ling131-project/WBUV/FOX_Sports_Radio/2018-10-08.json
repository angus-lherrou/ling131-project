anymore either do that\nYou had to be here with a joke [noise] okay have you with um what's just move on because I don't think anyone of a gift\nYou know find a way it's not that this is a bad start to the show it's just sort of all over the place have you noticed that not only are fast half hour but that's how we are but it's how we operate something tells me you're um you you got gas gone out in the parking lot or something [laughter]\nSomebody tells me that you might have papa doubling flew last night or that one went down with the doctors are doctors pat ... yeah the ... flu no doctors pat and Jake uh over in uh that's\nThat's a well we'll save that for a red gum Korea back to\nWhere we are feeling the falcons their season is over they stink done\nUh I I'm not going to say they stink can be one half their football team is actually pretty good that they're often um but it it's sort of defense or they're just so bad and I think in that division when you look at Carolina now who won today you look at New Orleans they they seem to or having you know getting things together again playing better defense we all know\nHow good breezes and everything else like I just I look at them and say I I just I don't think the students going to work out too well for them because John Jones Galileo recorded around those guys are coming back which is not coming back anytime soon and they probably need all three of them to come back at at this point\nSo it's it's really going to rely heavily on the fence and from that we're witnessing a right now\nYeah ... it's\n... it's like they're off at can't overcome what they're missing on defense\nAnd I think that they end up until this game on Sunday where Pittsburg just put it on them up until this game they were in every single game or probably should have won every single game I mean if you look at the the close call against the saints if you look at uh Cincinnati coming back and beating among the last second if you look at that final\nDrive and and red zone sequence against the eagles and weak one like you can make a case in Atlanta should be undefeated\nYou see the ... that it was before this past week's loss of Pittsburgh they were the first well I should say first in so teams that score thirty six plus points okay at home and didn't turn the football over in NFL history of four hundred and two and four and the Atlanta Falcons are two\nOf those for long [laughter] when I was on in my life\nAnd somehow they lost both those games so again it's it's not like they're off at this point that they're not you know they're playing pretty well they just can't put good enough to overcome how poorly their defenses playing\nAnd you know I get asked the question like is the window closing for this falcons team that was twenty three at a Super Bowl\nAnd let that game go and they let Tom Britain when patriots come back and win the football game but I don't know that they're ever going to be able to get back to the other one\nUm I actually and I was talking about this on my highly rated weekend overnight show that you don't listen to nor participate in four other stuff going on I'm like I Do recall college football yeah I'll be a gecko yeah I I Know but not with Joe Davis because he didn't show up for work I'm All right so um this is a at look at it if it's there are going to take it\nBut I was saying this that I actually genuinely feel bad for falcon sense I really do and it's not because a chick fillet is an open in the stadium on Sundays cars that place stinks\nThe reason I feel bad for falcons fans because to your point you were so close to winning a Super Bowl you add Tom Brady and the patriots on the ropes and there were so many things in that game that went wrong in that second half Julian Edelman catch only gets talked about enough\nBecause if he doesn't make that catch at lane is going to win that game and then you get to overtime\nThe strength of your team is the fence and your office doesn't even get a chance to get the football Tom Brady in the patriots go down the field and they rip your beating heart out of your chest on national TV you come back the next year\nAnd to their credit they go on the road they beat the rams and they beat him decisively in LA in the playoffs and then they probably should have beat Philadelphia and they lose that game but didn't ... I Know but it but and then if you look at just the injuries there is a metrics that they use like it's it's some sort of is that\nYou know like one of these like real inside a like I think they call analytics or whatever or whatever it is and it's called like the uh injury\nTo significant players that the falcons over the past three years ranked second six than the NFL and second again they've been primarily healthy throughout the course of ... time there\nAll of that got slip this year and you're in these close games stuff that never happens is happening and now you find yourself in dead last and and to your point key players are coming back I I feel bad for a man yet I met Ryan's not getting any younger uh he seems like mobility wise the hassle so down now the red\nZone if it what are your what do you mean what what what what was really fast well I'm just I mean like you know what I Would probably should have thought that one doesn't make any time thinking about it slowed down yeah it doesn't make any so what are what are you always put on a five to ...\nRight uh and that's you know kind of how the effect that's out of college football is cut out the NFL's becoming a little bit um with his officer put have so many points of the advantage of uh the officers have with the legal contact the points of emphasis and then the uh you know the rule changes and all that but\nYou know it's it's funny like this is a private she probably should be fourteen nothing right now but uh you know at this large part due to the fact that the red zone we talked about what the Russians just don't want to point man defense or they don't ... which is kind of a kind of interesting because it used to be a lot better than the secondary\nAnd then they've just somehow gotten got off all over the past a lost four games\nSo what do you mean they have the honey badger now right that's done nothing for like three years ago it was all about the fact they didn't have a quarterback but everything else was there yeah they had a piece in every bad timing man right and then that literally they were one of the\nBest past defense is Jay Jay ... have you on cloudy and back with a ... and and all that and now it's like they cannot stop anyone I mean back Prescott he was he was the average you like a hundred and eighty a hundred and Seventy or the game he'll probably sort of like three hundred yards tonight\nYeah it's uh so I mean the early on at least uh we got a good football game at least we're getting a good one you know it's not like that that crummy game we got last week where Pittsburg no showed especially in the second half\nAnd it was awful football so at least we've got a good one so we'll be monitoring that throughout the course of the show are Brady Quinn 'em by the way real quick so you've got a somebody recognize you are I'm I'm here report but he recognized you this past week a leader to brand and they ... they recognize you for a specific reason do hell Brady Quinn what\nHow will I Will so I took my whole family up to do a new house did Indiana game and so I'm I'm at the airport with my wife\nAnd our two daughters which was chaotic right so all I'm thinking is due to the plane get on the plane don't piss anyone off on the plane and they get off and get your destination like that's all I care about and then hopefully no one gets trapped on which we now and then which is very high possibility\nSo we're going through security we're about ready to walk the line and I think I was grabbing something or I was like picking up slowing our oldest daughter\nAnd um I noticed someone's idle Alicia and then a guy approaches me says hey\nYou're British Clinton right they just yeah it goes I Love you and Joe ... that's what I heard right and so I'm thinking like oh OK thanks she's like yeah it was because every Sunday night and I was like oh he's\nOn his\nShoulders I Love your show [noise] and I was like ...

I'm going to give you for options here as to when old del Beck and junior will have is in game now that I've written [noise]\nHot I'm an option one\nOption one oh del back in\nThe first to melt down of the sea option one is\nThe Philadelphia Eagles this Thursday on a short we [noise]\nOption two [noise]\nAt Atlanta Monday Night football the following week [noise]\nOptions three\nPhiladelphia\nThe twenty fifth of November a Fox scam\nAn option for [noise]\nAll of the above ... I\nThe Dell back to melt down if you will oh man um I I think we're\nWithin a week [laughter] I'm almost ... almost Seventy ... opposite because I think the primetime game is a great opportunity this happened it being a sure\nAlthough that presents the chance for them to kind of put this past them and they all play at home\nWe talked about that the whole vantage will there isn't that football so I\nI'll put it this way I don't think we get past October twenty second in Atlanta for modernize [laughter] which we\nPersonally football motivated football at some point he's going to go off if you lived many can't pick up a ... is play and just to go back to kind of a doubt feel drawing look it's hard to do when you don't have good protection and that has been the case and not a protection\nI mean the David Rush for over six yards today and I look I Know Carolina's defense is good\nBut come on man I mean at some point this season you've got to be able to put up\nYou know better numbers running the football at least for consistent numbers I'll put it that way because they've had you know times that had been over a hundred yards and then they've had thirty five yards that over a hundred yards and sixty five yards like it's just it's constantly back and forth back and forth\nAnd and today now I Want to say it's like the second time second week in a row they've been well below a hundred yards it just goes back to the initial conversation of you took the call Berkeley He was supposed to solve all your problems if that's what you thought that you were sorely mistaken and the first was\nA patch or I'm right now is probably thinking oh so yeah a little different than coach in ah in Cleveland\nIs this a lot different like he's going to get hammered by the media I mean there's no room to cover man if you look if you're covering sports you don't want ate and ate and boring you want one and fire you want a diaper fire or you want a Super Bowl contender those are the ones you want to cover that's the most fun\nBut uh yeah yeah I mean like the fact that was in New York's probably the best part I bet they took this job though with the thought by the U.S has got a year\nAnd then after a year they got to figure out what they want to do the problem is is the quarterback class for next year if they're going to pick a guy there is some options we can talk about it but I don't know if it's going to be what we saw this year's draft class\n...

Fox Sports radio do you want to ask you are coming up next year and just a moment because I think that there's a a bad situation and I'm going to throw a theory that you're not really conspiracy theory but just a theory that I have\nRegarding a quarterback and somebody who's a future hall of famer so we're going to have that for you next year on Fox Sports radio but for all the latest from around the world of sports including an update on Sunday Night Football\nIn Texas it's either going ... donors in Brady in game three of the LDS the Atlanta Braves have a five to two lead over the Dodgers and the bottom of the fourth inning but the Dodgers leading the series two games to none\nThe Braves were leading one nothing of the second inning with the bases loaded and is Ronald ... came to the plate a Braves fan named Caitlin tweeted quote\nIf a ... slams this I Will tattoo is face on my forearm no lie unquote well sure enough ... did just that\nBecoming the youngest player to ever hit a grand slam home run in the post season and for the record Caitlin subsequently tweeted quote take your pick at Ronald ... junior twenty four let's get cat unquote that's\nA bad idea to throw that out at an amateur regret that ah ... you'll get a Snapchat hurry\n[laughter] can't take some things that could also media as Jonah speaks authoritative Lee I presume\nIn game three of the other LDS the brewers completed asleep at the Rockies were the six nothing victory at Colorado Milwaukee ... one\nOf the ... the U.S on friday on Sunday Night Football the Houston Texans within ten six lead over the cowboys are committed in thirty one seconds remain in the second quarter\nThe Texans have a first than ten at their thirty one yard line in the late games the rams won in Seattle thirty three thirty one for the rams first ... start since two thousand one\nThe Vikings with a twenty three Twenty one victory in Philadelphia chargers over the raiders twenty six to ten cardinals get their first wind beating the forty niners twenty eight day team in the early games the Panthers trail the giants thirty one to thirty in the final seconds as gram granola lined up a field goal from Winston Salem\nSixty three hours away\nThe game six seconds left [noise] you know kick is long\n[noise]\nMitt mixing the call on WB T chiefs improved to five and over the Thirteen or fourteen victory over the jaguars lions over the Packers thirty one twenty three Green Bay kicker Mason Crosby missed four field goals plus an extra point\nThe browns have proved to to to a new one with the twelve nine overtime win over the ravens Isaiah cruel well ran for a franchise record to Nineteen and the jets thirty for sixteen whatever the Broncos\nThe bangles defeated the dolphins twenty seven to Seventeen to move to foreign one Steelers over the falcons forty one to Seventeen Atlanta now one and four and Steven house get kicked a forty six yard field goal at the gun to give the Buffalo Bills are Thirteen twelve victory over the Tennessee Titans ... back to you\nThanks ILO company alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance would guy go get a guy could comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier I'm I'm a little uncomfortable right now with something ready no what was that just something that that I'm\nA ... so we've got a tweet [noise] um I don't know if you've seen this but I have seen it um and uh and it's a tweet from our friend lived that Jesus\nUm I think I I think I may have [laughter] he is I think I may have seen\nNow I just so people out there understand why this is a character on our show who started showing up a couple of years ago it was a loser and making\nMaking picks on the air or a live bats on actual sporting events we've never seen him we don't know what he looks like we don't even know if it's a he or she or both we have no idea\nA piece of paper falls out of the sky it lands on the desk and there's a bat inside the paper and I read it on the air\nHe's been atrocious lately he went up [laughter] you can't win anything nothing cannot win a damn bet but he is just sent out a tweet\nUm and it it's it's the undertaker rising from the dead so I Believe that that is an indication that he should be coming up here um I I Am assuming within the next ten minutes or so that usually when he shows\nUp so I Hope not what was asked us one thing if I'm sure you know if he is going to bed on one thing tonight please don't be playoff baseball like I just hope ... Sunday Night Football it's Texans cowboys making about football yeah let's let's have a little bit of fun and make it about the football game\nI just I I don't want to have to switch over watch baseball game\n... and now is it because I'm maybe it it hurts a little bit to see your broadcast partner Joe Davis calling the game with John ... right now\nDo you want to be blunt I just I Do appreciate playoff baseball now\nI just it it's boring to me that football I'm Sorry if you're a baseball fan but I grew up playing baseball I Love baseball or nothing like you know hitting ... nothing like any of that stuff I did it I played it for a long time warfare to my life are still football's better\nYeah by the way if you want to watch Braves Dodgers just tuned in to Fox Sports one where you can find that game\nThat\nGood stuff or any way to wipe out the network All right um so let's get to a this year on Fox Sports radio so I Want to show some football sorry man that's why look I'd be the ... I Love the honesty I just [laughter]\nOr do what do\nYou like I it's like at telling your wife God I hate brunette [laughter] you know I used to\nBe honest I like ... there were two separate audiences people want to watch football players are like oh gosh well baseball's on like they're not sworn they're going to watch football and people were in our space we're going to watch baseball I don't know why you feel like it's the same body look I watch it all man I watch it all\nI Do so I mean you're degenerate gamblers\nOkay you know what that that is offensive and its factual I'm sick of it All right so let me ask you this question\nSo I mean this is not a conspiracy theory but I Do wonder this because I Love picking your brain when it comes to the psychology of quarterback ... last week Brady broke down with the quarterback walk is one of the most bizarre descriptions I've ever heard of my life I felt like you were describing Encino Man like somebody waking up in a block of ice\nIn which raises the Bible is not that great a brother the British were under the actor so far it's a it's not that great of a test of guitars and it was just he was in college so poly shoring him eating microwave ... seven eleven and it's not that good of a ... man stinks I'm Sorry [laughter]\nStop you there\nDo you watch that movie and then come back and watch the tape and then tell me how good that was it was awful but if it's on right now I watch it um and you would probably watch it over baseball uh but [laughter] so let me so let me just say this\nSo Aaron Rodgers when I'm when I'm watching the Packers and you're seeing them compared to Kansas City and the rams or even the bears a week ago or even some of these raider games um that we've seen not the one that we saw earlier\nBut you're just looking at other teams the Steelers and you're watching these other teams and they're putting up these huge point totals\nAnd they're they're doing these these Rasul down so plays and they're sending a mismatch isn't all the play calling and all that you didn't Rogers looks at that\nAnd says why can't we do some of that because he's kind of hinted at it being very passive aggressive and almost at taking a shot at Mike mccarthy and it feels like what they're doing there is almost outdated\nLike it feels like something about it doesn't work and and I know Aaron Rodgers is fantastic and he's a first ballot hall of famer and probably a top five guy in the history of the league\nBut just outside perspective it feels outdated and I wonder if he looks around and goes man I'm just better off when I get in to hurry up because when they got back into that game it was all passing it was hurry up often go down the field quick strikes try and get to the end zone and let me figure it out from there\nSo a few things um I I wasn't in many systems where they did this but some west coast systems in Green Bay is a west coast system they have in the two minute drills that hurry up often it's the quarterback will call it so\nFor a couple of things one it helps the quarterback get into a rhythm better because you're pointing at a faster pace it's almost like playing basketball right and distributing the basketball round implying at a faster pace like that\nThe other thing is he's got control he's the wood out they're calling the plays that he wants to run based on what he's saying\nSo that might be a reason as to why he's better off in those scenarios or when they play in the know how to pick up the tempo um the other thing is of course Aaron Rodgers is aware of what are the teams are doing and what's going on\nIn the NFL every single week as a quarterback\nYou go and you watch other teams and you kinda go through their system who had a big performance you didn't like I I can guarantee you this", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "08"}
