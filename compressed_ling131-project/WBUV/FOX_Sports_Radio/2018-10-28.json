get the boy I get the band together and play so\nI Love that idea I was looking at the chargers schedule because I Would love to go see a chargers game ... out there and so in November Eighteen to seems to be the most logical date\nBecause everything else I'll go quickly on this one from because they've got the Arizona Cardinals on November twenty fifth so the cardinals stink and that is right around Thanksgiving that's not a good time to go see the chargers right\nYou've got December ninth they host the bangles which isn't bad and then December twenty third right up where Christmases they host the ravens so that's out so I think that it's probably going to either be the Eighteenth against the Broncos are the ninth against the bangles\nOkay it's been a ... it was this would have been a good weekend really monitor you know ... airplane and San Diego against maybe uh-huh I Would have been good for you to come check out why\nCan't like you know do the show from the stadium\nOr you

we're going to be around fifty bucks easy\n\nSwing Nineteen Ninety nine that\nProblem and that's the point in our ... that was the thinking yeah we can go outrageous\nBut let's let's let everybody be a part of it\nYou know what I mean ... because if it's fifty dollars non golf fans are like you have to I'm cool [laughter] right only bugs you like I I like to see it I like to see I I I like to check this out even though I'm not a golf and I'd like to check this out fifty dollars no shot\nI'll I'll I'll I'll read about it\nAnd that is that's a win for golf yeah not just tiger and filled but that's going to do a lot I think it's going to be a good event and the thing that I think\nIt's really going to ... in um the Laker game or a when was that Thursday um\nFeel was was there with Reggie\nAnd they were talking about it and they were talking about the trash talk that goes in the Gulf that no one knows about [laughter] oh man that's occurring right so this is this is behind the curtain\nThat we as sports this rabid sports fans of all of these sports did was trash talk as prevalent right basketball football even baseball mhm\nAnd now we get to be a part of the trash talk oh golf right so now there's no commercials they're not going to commercials as they're walking to the next ah\nA tea it's it's there is there trash talk that already exist now feels that it is it right edited imagine\nYou um\nI don't know if you quite went to my character and integrity as just a general human\nBeing but it was close there was borderline when my both prediction was that the eagles would miss the playoffs the season and we fast forward to the year and now they are three and four\nYeah hey you know the funny thing is I've always\nStepped up\nAnd let you know if I was wrong\nAnd I was watching I'm watching the season as its transpiring and I'm like man be might be right on this [laughter]\nI Love that rice great though I Will give you bet okay I'm at least in the running for that bold prediction to be correct\nSo that's good man that's all I Need you know that's all I Need to bring it up time and time again but how about this game eagles against the jaguars it's in London\nWe all know Blake ... you've got some strong opinions on ... says you should [laughter] I'm not the only one strong again\nOh he's been wretched there's no doubt but he's not the only one that team in general has been brutal when that defense gives up forty points to the Dallas Cowboys\nIt's not just like ... so that's not to say no no no he's been good actually know he's been brutal he just isn't the only one on that team\nRight know ... ... and I think\nYou know the reason they traded for Carlos Hyde we don't know what's going on with an infinite and right in cannot get help and that was a huge part of their\nYou know their make up who they were last year and not having that piece you put too much pressure on a blog ... who can't we know you can't handle that pressure we know we'll give you a game where he can put over three hundred but he also give you a game you can put over eighty seven which is not what you want\nOut of your quarterback because that is the definition of inconsistent and so now all of this\nYou know pressure has been put on him to be the guy especially after the money they invested into um this off season\n[noise] uh against ... you know every once\nIn a while I was ... I don't know why you do that the borders are ah you'll yeah because you added dynamic running bag and a tremendous defense to fall back on you take those two things away and the defenses drugs are not getting up to the quarterback like\nThey did a at this time last year and they're running game a DJ yo does although he joined the humans job he's not limit for net he does bring that that type of a of of of toughness in in in hard yards\nThat Leonard does he can get you to thirty to thirty three on a regular basis if you had the ball off to him the first two down so now you're stuck with a guy who's inconsistent a quarterback who makes poor decisions\nOr if he has to throw the ball forty forty five fifty times the game you just do live in a world\nIt's brutal when you're one dimensional throwing the ball and Blake Bordeaux says Jekyll and Hyde at best you know that's a bad recipe the thing that's interesting to me though and this gave me from is both teams are three and four\nAnd the jacks have been called out way more than the eagles have right and I would actually I Would compare the eagles to the patriots because the patriots start off one and two\nAnd it's just a she'll say oh these patriots what's going on with them and the evil empire is crumbling and blah blah blah blah blah right and the eagles there are three and four there the defending Super Bowl champions they are three and four have they been just crushed have they been heavily criticized at all\nNo because you know that they can they can turn it around we don't know that about Jacksonville and I think the main point is that is fine my prediction remember our subjects but wouldn't make the playoffs\nRight but well I could see that collapse had right I just think that it's crazy that they haven't been heavily criticized yet the expectations are not even close to them as a patriot type team coming up next the three worst starting quarterback in the league right now [noise]\nOn helping you get more done is what we do that like what the auto zone rewards program you learn a twenty dollar reward every time you spent twenty bucks or more or less\nThis is just one more way to get more done I right now I'm going to ... when you were just as so many of us are all just went back or to single parents to super PACs must be purchased on the same cells received a visit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you see terms and they'll come slash your worst restrictions and he tells the story\nOn this episode of the world shorter sitcom by Cassie\nI say it's inside of the couch watching my new\nGas can be stricken me and Ken basic chicken too large map potatoes and or miss gets burn out again and I\nAre under twenty dollars\nWhat really matters is pretty incredible what chicken you can teach\nYou about life in any way of saying\nHey if I may vary subscriptions actress\nKelly Bennett from Gulf coasts mornings with uncle Henry Clay what does a weekday morning six to eight months talking about reality we've got a contest\nLottery it as a text them to win a thousand dollars we have a chance every\nGulf War it was a thousand dollars it was lifted the w._b. the Texas border\nThousand dollars for Eugene metro rail\nGoes goes morning with Kelly then it and they'll go and read with Dr again whether together on the nine six to eight every weekday minute ...

com or call eight hundred nine four seven auto the hard part figuring out which way is easier I think a couple of quick things about your Lakers he from they're making the right call starting Alonzo instead of run\nBy agree you gotta look toward your future and blondes do is either the future of the Lakers or he is a trade a blast that where you can you can get a lot in return it's not the same thing with Rhonda at his age I\nDon't I don't know why you would play Rondo and be in this let's win now and still not get to anywhere of great note when you compare their roster to the other ... best rosters in basketball most notably the warriors right right you got to look toward the future and start Alonzo get him some ... some time get him some ... out there\nYeah he he and and they have to be able to work together looney Ron do in April right that that when we're on does\nGoing to show up and that's when we'll be able to get the most\nOut of him in that ... million worth a you know that's when he playoff run do right now we need to get the young players in the Bronx playing together and\nBeen playing much better as of late the last two games\nIt it is just trying to figure out you know which pieces work better together and I do agree with you I think ... and\nBorrow deserved to be in the starting line up now that\nTakes away brand and anger and he's on suspension so it's easy to do that\nSo I don't know how that plays out you know I I but I Do love the spark that it was my brings with that a ... brings with the the second unit\nYou know I'm I'm I'm kinda torn you know because he's been sensational and the starting line up as we saw last year just building off as a tremendous rookie season but you have the great thing about this is they have talent\nThere's a lot of young Alan and yet there's ... for the future do you like to build upon absolutely\nAnd that's the ... and I love woodland springs to the table love I Love it\nI've ... the other night that's always good it just he brings it an energy that yeah\nThere's not a lot of guys bring\nWell I look at it where if it's Rhonda one line so I look at Ron do was more of like a microwavable meal\nBecause of all of his experience right you know he doesn't need to jail and he doesn't need a lot of minute to figure out his role and figure out how to play alongside these guys he knows what to do I look at Alonzo ball\nHe's like one of the stakes that you've got to marinate for eight hours and you got to do a lot to that he needs the playing time he needs to figure out how to play alongside all these teammates and get more wraps and get a shot up and call it a ... time yeah yeah I Know that\nYeah I think it's the right move 'em\nBy the way quick thoughts on spit gate what'd you make of Rondo saying\nI spit on him I er I exasperated his how he put it [laughter] it's like it's not my must be it's within my mom like he had spit on anybody did you not see spit fly in from his mouth to they'll they'll eat\nThere was there and there's animosity there they they've never liked each other you know and a lot of things came out from different players saying I'll all four teammate drift ball it I mean this is it a secret everybody's been demeaned the Andre Jordan tried to break free [laughter]\nRight and that was one of the main reasons\nYeah and look at Blake Griffin and I'm going back and\nGuys don't lie to him you know so he gets on your skin and he's dynamic player he will be in the hall of fame\nIs just you know at a certain point you know fisticuffs happen\nRight yeah but it's just like it was the classic case of Mr direction by Ron do it was like\nHey forget about me spending on this guy he's a bad team made like start having that Congress right in that it was just going off and having that conversation it'd be like if you did something wrong\nYou know and you just change the subject altogether\nTo take the spotlight off of yourself it doesn't mean what you did wrong never existed from that point on you know right\nIt was crazy silly I can I ask you about this do while we were talking about trying a little bit earlier or\nA legit hears from Derek how about this report cello last night he says he cried after Nathan evolved the had this brilliant game three outing came out which what seven plus innings yeah that yeah\nHe was unbelievable he gave up the game winning home run ... but he was he believe all the mellow the starting pitcher city shed tears\nOkay with that crushing law\nCrushing loss but the series is still going on bill going\nCrushing loss big win injury that's where you live\n[noise] okay [laughter] where do you live [laughter] there's no crying in baseball [laughter]\nEven if you lose an Eighteen in a game and heartbreaking fashion\nOnce again doesn't there's no crying in baseball by the way do you think that they should tweak the extra inning format based on the game last night there's some people saying all radical changes coming soon you want to see that he from\nThey didn't care that the oh yeah ... ... ... it doesn't\nMatter when you do something like that in another country it's an international incident mhm right and not just go go ahead guys right so for me I'm looking like okay I Need to know the information that that happened was that\nThey were trying to settle their tab\nAnd I'm just guessing here and they were like hey we didn't have all of this to drink we didn't do this and they're like issue the pay this money no like we're not doing that right we didn't drink that will pay for what we drunk we didn't do that well this is what we were you were charged for\nSo but you have to pay and bill I Know we're not painted and then they tried to leave and an odd cage and blah blah whatever physical education should ever happen mhm right that's when you are the players they ... when he called the forties we need to get to the bottom of this\nBut just walking out getting into an altercation with bouncers\nNot acceptable what I Need to know the circumstances of it right I just don't want to just blank leave for a while just pay your bills and all that because I've been in situations where I've got to build on my ... I don't even drink so [laughter] you know I didn't\nI didn't drink the mountain dew or your you have this new fifty right now I'm not paying and you\nCome to me with a ten thousand dollar bar tab below your you have four bottles of no I did\nNot have been there and they've been you know you get taken advantage of spreads easier you travel abroad you being situations where you will get taken advantage of\nIt so I Need to know what what what do I need to know their side of what was going on\nThen I can really assess what happened but I Will say this vote physical altercation\nNever should've should've never happened right got to be part of ... at least know right you got to be smarter than that\nBecause it now I mean really what are the chances that\nAnd to your point we don't know all the ins and outs which is important but what are the chances that this club just comes up with a doozy of a story\nThat's possible but they are like hey you got to pay the sixty four thousand dollar bill and they're like what we just had wings and we had a couple of bruised that was it a bill should be about five hundred that's sixty four thousand\nAnd they just start to sweat the security team just start sweating in order to [laughter] I just don't see that being the case\nIt escalated somehow and it never should have resulted in anything physical\nUm so this could be like best case scenario these guys still look wrong at least with that facet right right and that standpoint they could be even wrong gr depending on how this is exactly went down\nWe'll just have to see how it unfolds but we got game time tomorrow morning man sure\nCouldn't as we got arrest\nMe in a ... day away right right did it rams are gonna be out there by herself\nAnd they had a lot of injuries on top of this right so bad bad situation let me ask you this what we're talking about Jacksonville\nWith Blake boils being on the quote unquote short leash that's what Doug them around and said do you think that puts\nLake ... in a worst position for him to know hey man if you start screwing up your out\n\nWhere do you think he steps up a little bit here\nOr he has to step up this type of player used to be you know you want to know what type where you are here you go visit you have to be perfect\nIf not we're going to pull you step uh\nYeah you know and I hate when people say that's not fair to put players on it is you're a professional athlete that's just the reality of it you're ... athlete we pay you millions to step up and perform if you can't don't worry about the leash\nYou know what's crazy is for Blake morals in particular I don't think it really matters I think\nWe know what Blake is good Blake is not that bad you know no I live here you have ...

guess got by the ... and the guy told Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more and car insurance was Geico so just go to guy go dot com or give them a call one eight hundred nine four seven auto and the only hard part well let's figure out which way is easier he's Aaron tour as I'm already Spanier\nI by the way thanks the guys got for filling in I gave the sake of the night off the air and well I mean come on now at the guy was begging me for the night off so we can go to the Dodgers game what am I going to say no wow these what does he got back from a guy or what\nWhat a slacker that goes by the way I already did you see all four or four of the major teams will all be playing in downtown Los Angeles tomorrow um let me correct you uh five five who's the fit the Oscar yeah yeah there are a little they're a little out of town there but ah\nWhy our son Carson you know that that's you know that's the difference between a Vermont and whatever for modern wherever yeah wherever you\nLive out here as I say wherever the next town is with a a a stop light\nThan what they do have and you live in Burbank or where I actually live in Pasadena okay so the traffic are you is it going to be like Carmageddon tomorrow tried to maneuver through the freeways are you staying home or are you going out the venture to go watch a game or go check on in life\nI Am staying home but there are four games the kings I Believe at twelve thirty at staples Centre right the rams that won the Dodgers at about five and the clippers at six and for people who don't know the layout of Los Angeles staples Centre and Dodger Stadium or probably five miles apart from each other\nIt's going to be miserable so I Will be staying home like one of your snowstorms Arnie where you can't leave the house for days up there in Vermont I I've packed the canned goods I'm not going anywhere tomorrow\nThe sports uh Carmageddon is that what we're getting it to me is that is that what they call you or what\nYeah yeah it is and I guess I I don't know maybe things change a little bit with the Dodgers are being on the brink of elimination actually but uh\nIt's right now Red Sox lead five for a while because as you heard ... tell you the divers had the RBI single\nOr that brought in ... cold who had the double beforehand down the third baseline runners on first and second rich she'll put six of the third gave up one hit one run seven strike outs the bullpen and two and a third for heads for runs\nA in that time anyway there's two outs runners in first and second of the top of the night or the Dodgers have to close it down here ... up for the red socks\nThat just can't afford to give up any more runs they got to come up in the bottom of the knife only down five for 'em and try to scratch one way or or get lucky and hit a bomb otherwise you know hit a home\nRun otherwise ah they're down three games to one and that is really going to get tough this this was there they were up for nothing you just don't blow for nothing weeds in the world series I Wonder what the record is I'm Aaron for a losing a wheat and losing\nA game in the world series it like that yeah how about a a a U.S essentially a must win game for here or by the way you said they got they got to hold the the lead to five or the deficit to five yeah or\nI was going to say I just assumed that the analytics are probably going to tell Dave Roberts to pinch hit for many Machado maybe with Clinton her shower or something so I I have no doubt that even if they do they Roberts will find a way to screen\nSo you're anti analytics is that what you're saying I mean especially I mean I'm a little anti analytics too but it's hard to argue with a team that's made back to back World Series appearances and and and by the way speaking about the odds are analytics if I told you Steph Curry was over twenty from the field\nUm and they were down by two you would not tell them to stop shooting with you that you would say well keeps eventually it's going to go in the odds\nOr in our favor that just shots to go in so people are true to you you play the odds there don't you\nYeah but if I were if the situation was\nNeed him to make a half court ... there's no real comparable thing in in basketball because what you're asking Kennedy Jansen to do tonight is something that he hasn't been asked to do all year and so the point that I Am trying to make about analytics and this is my belief in analytics in general\nIt's a piece to the puzzle but it can't be the only deciding factor it\nBut it's also supposed to be used for the course of a season not just for one game I Believe\nYeah but I but I think that you know at a certain point you have to go with common sense and we saw what happened last night with ... and\nUm and I just ... and there's been other instances to wear the right analytic move has not worked out and so I think sometimes look people in and this is the only thing it drives me crazy but I only saw these people will say oh you know things like being clutch aren't analytical or getting nervous in a tight spot\nAnd so I don't think analytics can account for the fact that can lead Jansen knows hey last night I had a six out saving I blew it\nAnd I got to come in and do the same thing again now I'm not saying you don't pitch Kennedy jeans and I'm just saying don't put him in that situation similar to what happened last night that's all I'm saying is I think analytics or important they're good they're valuable but they can't be the only deciding factor\nUm right now better tend to get an infield single he beat it out a base hit so the bases loaded in the top of the night with two outs the five four leaf for the Dodgers\nAnd they'll make a pitching change so a little go ahead and see if they can get keep it to within five four right or just a couple of more games that are going on Texas has closed within three but Oklahoma State that just got a touchdown extra point good there are thirty eight twenty eight\nThis is I mean I'll be kept it obvious on this where they are in a a crush or for Texas this was a team that was you know right there that would have been maybe a top aide when the BCS came out on Tuesday a last year or you will find them anywhere on the top fifty and ... probably\nNo I don't think so and I think kind of the top Fifteen that's probably a little reflective of where they are I mean they're they're not a finished product yet I Know they beat Oklahoma on that neutral field by the way\nAs your buddy ... Chris plank knows as he I'm sure you guys talked about on your show that led to Oklahoma firing their defensive coordinator and they've looked a lot better so I think even in just the last few weeks Oklahoma has re assert themselves in the big twelve\nBut yeah no Texas will not be in the top ten going for it and I look at it it's not a knock on 'em it's Tom Herman second year it's been so long since they've even been this nationally relevant\nIt should've been tied up a two games apiece by the way my my still my favorite\n... a jinx kiss of death whatever Penn State\nThey were up at like Eighteen points about six minutes to go or something crazy like that you're like oh it's right then it'd be a Penn State fan and\nThen here comes Ohio State they end up winning the game oh I Can't I'm never forget that one\nToo yeah I I met a few of them I don't know if you do that but I've I've had a few of them\nAre right now it's not pretty they finally get out of it the red Sox are just going ballistic I mean they're really talking the fans you know the Dodgers troll the red socks on Twitter\nAfter game three put some mouthed about you know obviously about the victory what are you going to learn you just don't poke poke the bear you don't do something like that especially when you're still doubt two games to one hour\nYes sir I get distracted because ah the president of the United states just tweeted about this game and I'm not making it up what do you want me to read when he said it's pretty funny I go ahead if I die it's in the ... it's a very presidential tone he said watching the Dodgers Red Sox final innings\nIt is amazing how a miniature takes out a pitcher who is loose and dominating through almost seven innings\nRich hill of the Dodgers and brings in nervous reliever relievers who get select for only gone managers do it all the time big mistake exclamation points so apparently you know I don't know if the president wants to call him but he's in\nUh the tourists camp here about um about a day Roberts in him being blamed for Mr President if you are listening You're welcome to call in we'd be glad to ah talk to you about this because I agree with our president\nOn or how this bullpen was managed matter of fact why to Donald from washing [laughter]\nThat'd be pretty wild member of the day we tried to get Brian on the show does Bryant was tweeting up arm and he's like oh does know how could you know I'll do any media interview I was like will take you on the show right now and uh we have heard of course\nBut make sure those lines are open and case Donald from Washington doesn't want to call that eight seven seven on Fox ... nine nine six sixty six nine though I got to feel we're not going to hear from dirty Dodger fans are into obviously when this game gets the third out and then\nThey're going to be calling in droves of questioning day Roberts is I Hope they're not going to start the this guy got to get fired routine because\nThat's the first thing from the truth or why are they going to start or what the\nTwo most powerful men in the free world the president and me are calling for his head I mean if if those two voices can't get change I don't know what\nWould write a real quick go ... and I know we're short on time or did you watch any of the Florida Georgia game and it was kind of a\nA struggle early and it was a good back and forth game Georgia the uh uh you know a got a bunch of turnovers a Florida just turned it over left and right and then it was too much too late they benefited from that and it was all George dropped out good victory for them\nYeah absolutely and and I was a little dubious about could Georgia bounce back there were so physically dominated a few weeks ago\nBy LSU but you look at that game and I will say this to Jake from the quarterback\nMaking so many plays with his arm if Georgia wants to compete with either Alabama or LSU or whoever they are going to play for an S. E. C. championship he's gotta make plays like that like you did today with his arm and it'll be interesting to see if he can keep that up because by the way they had a huge one with Kentucky next week when there's going to win the SEC\nOklahoma had no problem with Kansas State\nI was Seventeen nothing at the end of the first they rolled Murray was phenomenal a night did it twenty four three fifty two three touchdowns but still not the same classes to about race I Believe uh with you that one is over 'em but still at a phenomenal uh\nOur on our ... phenomenal game and by the way how do you decided to play baseball yeah we're expecting him out here in Burlington, Vermont because\nUm that is the single life or what the old days we drive to the correct\nYeah well I mean I Can't speak to the single a affiliates but now I was going to ask you have you and Planck ever talked and we can maybe get into this and the next hour but how good must ... baseball if that's his better sport than football he's pretty he's pretty good uh football\nYeah no no doubt about well our our quarter back in high school who played in the super bowl was one of the topics of baseball time Jay Schrader I've

you think\nWow you you crush cleansing the entire first hour say never played anybody you put them in at number two ahead of Notre Dame\nYeah I mean I had no choice this why does it mean they'll finished ahead of him I think they have a better resume the Notre Dame is\nAs you said the bad you know I Do look at the margin of victory and those were Dame has bothered me by a with a small margin of victory so I'm not great games either but that doesn't mean that that's always a division three two or three big deal it is\nAnd it doesn't ultimately matter I Will say where it matters is in my rankings because I have bam all one [noise] I have Notre Dame too I think the combination of the when he gets Michigan wow and undefeated I think they deserve to be their number three [noise]\nI have adds up today and this will not be the same as of next week but as of right now\nI have LSU and number three you get about ... when it doesn't mean I mean should I Do I Need to put central Florida headed unless you know but that said whatever\nYou do a central Florida is undefeated though it's not about what they don't have the ... they made the news and and our crushing Clemson resume seeing how soft they are\nNot going to go out and put them a behind the team with one laws but a LSU I Would say a first of all their losses on the road to a top ten team in Florida and their quality of Windsor better I mean is this what'd you think what do you think the BCS five is going to be when it comes out on Tuesday I think uh\nIn this war for yeah so I think it'll be I Do\nThink they'll have Notre Dame and number two because I Do know won't ... who you want to bet will you quit your job as a pitcher lunch on that if you're OK send me some uh some farm to table stuff yeah farm to table to males as far as that's what we're going to do [noise] uh I think they'll have Notre Dame and number two incomes and number three I Do agree I don't\nThink that they will put a a one last team my head of an undefeated clubs in but I just think Ellis used body work is better\nBy the way I Know you didn't ask me number five I had Michigan although I think you could you could argue for Oklahoma and they have look so good coming out of that by the last two weeks or so a lot of good teams this year Georgia's looking good again\nI get the bugged out at the match ups today and as you mentioned what was it four or five teams in the was it the top ten weren't even an action to them yeah by the Alabama yeah yep go ahead and you can either was Ohio State Michigan LSU\nAnd central Florida the mother did central Florida nights five to ... [noise] so where I Want all the college football that we have\nYou would think that even without those teams we still have a pretty good weekend but [noise]\nYou take away that sparked in really went downhill there was nothing for us to really agar out on other than maybe Georgia for the coming on him\nYeah and the other thing too is I Know that Florida State was bad last year but usually Florida State Clemens is one of the marquee games and obviously\nThis year it was a total died or some of the other one's Washington state Stanford could have been good but Stanford kind of really fell off the map the last couple of weeks or with two losses in their last three games coming into today and then they actually took a loss as well so I get it but I I just think the bottom line is when an Alabama\nLSU Michigan and Ohio State all have a by weakening it'd be the equivalent of like the rams the chiefs the patriots and the Packers all having to buy or something you just ... it would just feel like a weird weekend in the NFL\nAnd of course the red Sox up three games to one after eight nine ... victory over the Dodgers is going to be one of those signature losses at Dodger fans are going to be talking about\nFor years to come saying man we had them on the roads were up for nothing we're going to tie the series at two games apiece no doubt we would have one game five and went on to win the world series all of a sudden one inning won three run Homer another Homer ties up and all of a sudden it's three games to one in favor of Boston\nI absolutely think that it is a game that Dodgers fans will talk about forever for all the reasons you just mentioned Arnie I'm your head you're at home you have a chance to tie the series maybe take the lead flip the series on its head on Sunday night they lose so let me ask you this I mentioned\nDave Robert I think he's got to go you said oh you can't you can't let go of guys meet\nYou how you learned some guy that what it takes you back to back World Series I said this about John for over Boston I hear a with the red Sox who took it back to back aways titles are they replaced it with corps but obviously that was a good move\nYeah I I Would say first of all that's a great example of someone that sometimes you just know and the example I was going to use ironically was a different Red Sox won remember Grady Little\nRight she um for people don't remember obviously used was two thousand three that was the Arab ... ear he left in Pedro for too long Pedro Martinez\nThey end up the Yankees make this massive rally Aaron Boone hits home run and win the game and it just felt like after that last they couldn't bring 'em back they didn't they brought in Terry friend Conan ended up winning a World Series the following year\nI just I mean how does a Dodgers fans feel confident that in the big games Dave Roberts going forward is going to be the guy even if you get back to the world series\nI think the Dodgers going to have a tough decision ahead I can see your point Ernie I'm not going to argue with you and say you're wrong you are often but not necessarily on this one but I I'm kidding but I could see the argument from Dodgers fans and I can't look at this guy I Can't watch this guy why\nOut 'cause we're thinking about the the witches and found that they're not just pressing a religion they're also you know business people their own shop there all along you know they all have some kind of stake in the economy of Salem\nWinning for that [laughter] yeah\nSo on and it's kind of like a little bit offensive but I'm On the other hand for brings people into your shop that's uh net when for them so it it's it's again rarely complicated to like a fascinating degree the whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here what are you doing ... exactly that\nAfter they get the money anyway so then it did show you mentioned that that you know because of the dean Halloween town it it it has done it and because of the ... the sheet shift you're aspect of\nOf witchcraft 'cause it was perceived back then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know we're wills and goes and and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town\nAnd then I also part of that they're kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is ... which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys over there either by forming your actual street performers or as visitors\nUm three point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than sailing you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with the no\nUniversal studios and some others in Hollywood those are the places you want to go to the um horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well so it has all these facets that kind of tired of them are dark I guess is the is the um common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with W Oscar a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time and he left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for private tears in St Louis or\nThe sale of the bill's on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... well not the country at the time before leaving the country who sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing like because there were so good that trade overseas\nAnd of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff that you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories to most of these coasts where all the kind of pirates head out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter of their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of failing to have\nLike I said earlier like two dozen layers above just being the side of a trial and back and fixing that due to\nThe uh yeah and it's not just a trial of course to write it the series but that those trials it was just listening to\nTo talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused in center you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you go what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any way you did write\nThat ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand but balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bump like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh math math\nI mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting\nMore and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and still happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well I Would really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open so I I I Would never get flu shots that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but I think what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now we're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want to risk just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually a ... year round the only other time of year there's not that many curb but in October for instance they are the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause they're just getting over a hundred people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start\nStart hitting the train and start having their cars so there that's really\nGood at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ... hour\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad really bad then\nThey got to get them up before the ... or maybe the two in the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nAll right

C. S. opponent South Carolina state\nThey beat Florida Atlantic they rolled pit which is that to the instant win but it's nothing special nothing to write home about that here Don conference schedule it can't be that bad when you play in that bad of a conference\nSo I look at teams that are in the eight people ranked under them I Would have four teams when the playoff committee unveiled the first poll of the season on Tuesday\nI Would have Ohio State Kentucky whose beat in Florida on the road\nI Would have West Virginia I Would also have Washington state all rank ahead of UCF all of them I Would ...\nEven though Texas and Florida lost and they will be below UCF I Would have four teams that are currently under UCF ahead of them when the playoffs committee ... releases the first ball\nYeah and what a win for Kentucky yesterday beat Missouri on the road Fifteen fourteen of combat when I mean right now Kentucky to control their destiny and the SEC east they've got a big game that's where they played Georgia next week I mean there's a chance right now Kentucky could roll I mean I\nI don't see them beating Georgia especially I I just I just don't think they have the manpower especially with Georgia did the Florida yesterday but I I'm I'm very impressed with the ... Kentucky has done those far this year\nYeah that's the biggest football game in Kentucky history next week hosting Georgia but yeah they've had a good season seven in one so far and a tougher road a much tougher road than what we've seen from UCF I Know people think it's personal it's not personal\nIt's just I hate bad logic I hate how it turns into this\nWorld Cup on let's grade on a curve in the bleeding hearts it's like a Sally Struthers tell us on you know or Sally Struthers dislike for Fifteen cents a day you can help these poor unfortunate kids that's how people act when it comes to use the F to joke\nIt is ridiculous looking Alabama people crack on their schedule they are at number now for LSU next week do you realize what people would be saying if UCF was at LSU and played that game they wouldn't\nStop talking about that game but it's cost over when it's Alabama it's just ridiculous you know one yeah\nI I've always believed that people should always stay in their lane and that means teams as well and I think that college football as well served back in the day when they had that one double A.\nAnd keep it that way you know there are certain teams that don't belong in the big leagues\nAnd the confidence of ACT American athletic conference would UCF in South Florida and Houston in Cincinnati Tulane east Carolina they do not belong in the same breath as the SEC or the big twelve ... twelve there just off but I may have let them in there\nIf there are four seats at the playoff table\nYou got to have a legitimate resume\nYou got to have a tough road you gotta have at least an impressive when you got to go outside of the conference and schedule a big boy Boise they did it for years in years and years I\nSo this idea of all no one wants to lose to use the F 'cause it's gonna be embarrassing will Boise State found a way year after year after year to schedule an impressive opponent in the non conference schedule and they said Oklahoma ... name yeah UCF can do it they just haven't and I'm not going to great on a curve because they haven't\nSo of course they don't have that hanging down to do it that is [laughter] I'd rather be on their own little way and say they want and then they'll start crying that they deserve more but you don't want to prove it that's what they got to do that to be an advocate\nAndy I Would be the biggest advocate\nIf they had a couple of big time wins if they've scheduled up in the non conference\nI Would be saying that it'd be like hey look the schedule in the conference is what it is but they went out and they beat insert this team and they went out and beat this ranked team that's impressive they deserve it they ran the table again I Would be campaigning for him but they don't have that non conference when that's impressive they don't like\nTo see someone who has the the hanging down to defend them I'm here with the phone call at eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox as you mentioned the number eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three fifty\nNine oil is at they know show and we should act handy for a minute or so I Will do that it's Bryan Noah's Sandy from all my life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios and of course the lineup today Bronx talk radio at the end of this hour our number two bottom barrel betting on of course in a third of our\nAllies more of as AKA he's the sheep ... and Brian no it knows picks but\nThis is exactly what they waited for that next\n[noise] everything into reading so we've condensed it for you you can see just hot gas at Fox Sports radio dot com\nDo come on interviews with queen ... jazz rock sports radio dot com\nRather here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like then you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bouncy within a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game with another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car through car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide editorial nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy it real pricing an actual inventory and a simpler buying experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nThere also more likely to enjoy a faster buying experience by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy it more confident card by experience\nSome features not available in all states\nIf you suffer from E.

melons all that other stuff out\nNo no no here [laughter] first of all I Would think that the night before I gained is somewhat of a curfew maybe I'm mistaken but I think that most of these clubs have curfews so why they were out is beyond me okay let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that the coach treats them as professionals and say get the better than a normal hours so they went out okay\nWhy were you not want to pay the bill and I don't understand how you can put up a bill sixty four thousand dollars anyway what do you what are you spending it on ... that's\nThe thing that's maybe why the altercation happened maybe they're disputing what they actually\nBought you know where all of a sudden it happens where you have this club bill and it's outrageous and what are you going to do you just going to say no that's not mine and they don't believe you and it turns into this whole thing but never should have ...\nThe lead up to a physical altercation right we've got to get the details but your initial point why are you out at that time this close to a game time you know\nIs that right but in any event\nThis does not look good for the Jacksonville Jaguars they've been out scored Ninety to twenty eight over the last three games\nAnd they're not trending up I'll say that and they're playing it desperate Philadelphia Eagles team that three in for the same record as the jags and they're going to be that much tougher to beat today because Jacksonville has made this came tougher on themselves\nI'll give jak save a lot of credit they did not released and they have no

Bronx talk radio in less\nThan ten minutes and the ravens ad Panthers among other try once again with my line of work ravens at what do you mean\nWhat what ... going on here\nRavens at Panthers okay a check it out here Baltimore given a three Bolton was given three yes\nI it it's lists in Andy if it's like a point off or whatever I've got it at two and a half Caroline is two and a half point home dog if you're in the point five here it's\nStory that's fine because it depends on whatever you're looking at it on line ... one and a half now you're crazy person you know\nRight I Know I'm with you OK yeah ... the ravens right now last week the ravens also heartbreaking to New Orleans by a point twenty four twenty three Panthers the eagles Twenty one Seventeen\nAnd I thought the ravens defense right now one of the best to leave with their linebacker thrill ... can a young to Dario Smith and I'll tell you what Kim new mayor of his work cut out for him today I don't see him running a lot today because I don't think he can adjust these guys\nWell you look at the ravens as you're pointing out Andy number one in scoring defense number one in total defense they've only given up about two hundred and eighty yards per game\nTo eighty point six if you want to be precise that's really good they leave the league insects with twenty seven so that's a tough defense man and like you're talking about with Cam Newton might not be running a whole lot today but he's been successful this season you look at him right now in past rating he's fourteenth\nRight under Ninety five which is good leads all quarterbacks with two hundred and fifty seven rushing yards so it's been an under the radar sneaky good season for Cam Newton not a whole lot of fanfare but was huge on that game winning drive last week at Philly the fourth in ten was a collection throw so camp\nWe'll see what he can do today at home against the ravens team too tough game is back to back because even though Phillies record is bad meeting them on the road when they were desperate last week at three and three before the\nPanthers gave him an el that's a nice way in but it's come back home with the raven themes you said heartbreaking loss with Justin Tucker missing the extra point this is not an easy Gail they'll ... let's see what they're made of\nDid you see the replay on TV would just uh Tucker's eyes [laughter] yeah they were going to come out of his head yeah and I don't blame them really\nThat was the first extra point you'd never miss like I I'm Justin Tucker I don't miss extra points what's happening over here that's how we look at it yeah\nYou just don't how many bedrooms went crazy after that last\nOh my gosh can you imagine losing on that ah you remember any if you go back into the hot tub time machine remember when they made this new extra point rule\nAnd they were a lot of people that are willing how much difference does it really going to make I mean really come on it's made a big difference last week would be a huge indication of how big of a difference it made\nYou know I I tell\nYou what I'm not really a big advocate of change\nBecause you know why I'm a staff guy and\nLike when you look at the record books it doesn't really mean anything because now you extra points at the thirty three yard line as opposed to what it used to be like was seven to ten yards out which is ridiculous so you can't do any comparisons right there but yes it does change the game the Pittsburgh Steelers and their situation they go to a lot more than they go for one\nThat's what they do right now because now you know what though I mean if if you talk to my Tomlin I mean he will tell you that if it when in doubt he'll go for the two I think that they do it it was a little more so more so than any other team in the league\nBronx talk radio right around the corner as well do you buy discover card we treat you like you treat your area is back from the day are older than yours

you also look at the weapons that he won't have he's not going to have Quincy a new law that going to have Robbie Anderson so you combine all this stuff together as going to be tough for the jets to keep this one close\nYeah and I tell you what last week that just ... onto the Vikings thirty seven Seventy and what's up with the Vikings later on but I think the Vikings have found their way right now they're starting to get on a little bit of a role and the bears gave the patriots everything they had but it was thirty eight thirty one but that was a pretty good game against the patriots last week\nRight and I also look at a man you think about all the points that the patriots scored gained a lot of yards but a lot of that goes to gain planning and the patriots you know the sand and they just have a really really smart approach they're going to go up tempo\nThey're going to use that to their advantage to try to neutralize that pass rush to the bears we knew that James White was going to be heavily targeted out of the backfield\nAnd he had a lotta catches almost double digit catches against the bears last week you just don't have the same imagination offensively in terms of play calling with the jets and Sam Donald comparing him to Tom Brady right now is apples\nOrange and so it's a much different opponent this week and what the bears didn't do defensively last week I think they have a lot more advantages this week against gain green\nNo doubt about that and I look at the jet schedule and the free ones are at Detroit Denver at home in Indianapolis at home so one of those teams have uncommon those teams will have ... defense is they really do and they're just rebel too exploiting those bad the pitches I tell you right now the bears defense is it a different league then oppose the apparently those teams are and I don't think the the physical have\nAny chance of winning this game and you know you talk about what nine and a half points it's a lot of points right there I think the bears would be I think the best put up a lot of points to against the jets\nYeah I agree with you I don't know if it's going to be what was it forty eight to ten [laughter] against Tampa remember that show lacking I may be that bad but I think Andy again you go back to what was it just last week against the Patriots' mark game plant\nThey gave up a lot of yard a lot of points to Brock ... and the dolphins and so we know that was in Miami the heat contributed for sure I think this is one of these games where you've got to see it before it happens you got to be proactive not reactive\nAnd what the bears defense giving up thirty one so the dolphins thirty eight so the patriots and I know there's a special team score with Kyle band knowing the black pond but still a lot of points given up I think that the bears the fence\nThey get a lot to prove today and when you're facing the undermanned due to injury jak undermanned dude roster anyway I think the bears defense rebounds and a big way today\nYou're with your idea but I Do want to see some more Mitchell trip escape because several several weeks ago they were saying he's an ex Johnny United and uh he's come down to earth a little bit I Want to see a big game out of him if in fact he has a big game left of them that that's the question with him you know in a week to week basis you don't know whether you get a tribute ski\nYeah he's up and down it certainly is he's not a consistent quarterback he had that aberration game against Tampa\nBut he's just got to find more consistency you see the play making ability you see it almost every week and his numbers are bad on the season Thirteen touchdowns six picks past reading right at Ninety seven I liked the pairing with him and Matt Maggie\nThis is a game though where ... it should be like a given that he shrines and you can't say it's a stone cold block heading in he should but he just has an earned the benefit of the doubt in terms of consistency the expectations are quite there because the consistency isn't gotta started with just your performance against the jets for sure\nRight so we both agree it's a bears game today no doubt about yeah

were with concessions in parking I mean you're talking about maybe a second mortgage I mean who pay ... ... thirty dollars for a ticket absolutely\nWould I yeah who would yes yeah it depends who's playing if we're talking St Louis cardinals over here my dad has talked about this for years and years where he's got to get to a World Series game with the cardinals in it\nAnd he's like he says this every year many times where he's like the cardinals are in it where there were going so yeah if the cardinals are in the world series and it's three hundred and thirty bucks per ticket I'm going to splurge are there times you've got to splurge you know that's one of them\nI'm not doing it I'm not doing it\nWell or you could tell you that I went through a cordless World Series game back in the day against the twins\nI went which game was it\nWhat what game was it I mean we love the theories yeah you know what it was such a long time ago I forget what I tell you what happened it was a sponsor of mine in Cincinnati I W W radio Stacey storage and moving it was a great sponsor he\nHe got a plane and they took the all these people on a plane we flew out to St Louis that afternoon and right after the game we flew right back it was it was amazed by I mean who he was the best to use the ... the man and a heck of a guy and we went to see that guy was cold I Know that it was real cold that day\nBut where we each sat right behind home plate\nNotes you I mean like Marlins Man back there oh yeah it was great [laughter] did you dress in all orange glow you stood out\nNo no no he didn't do that and uh I blended right and I really did by the way talking about the NFL I got a line for you today on a game and uh it's gonna be the Broncos to the cheese Broncos reinforced she's six and one last time they met though was weak for at Denver Kansas City won by four points twenty seven twenty feet so they got a\nSecond chance today and Kansas City is given ten given tend to Denver how's that\nIt's depending on where you're at nine and a half ten whatever point and a half not a big deal in terms of this show could be a huge deal in terms of betting on the game and play\nAnd I'm so the book has come back to bite you did a big way but you know Denver's should have won that game earlier this year\nYou look at the final Dr hit a wide open ... Thomas along the sideline in case scheme them just didn't throw inaccurate ball right right Denver should have won that game and I just wonder von Miller is hobbled he's got an ankle injury\nSo even if he goes today are we going to see anything close to what we normally do for him he's a flat out Dutch you've got to have your past rush right against Patrick ... homes and company\nAnd von Miller is enclosed being von Miller this could get ugly real oil\nGiant both teams put up a lot of pointless waste that she's going to the Bengals forty five ten and the Broncos beat the courts forty five ... we'll see what happens right now\nAnd uh the first time they met I I went back to see that game and look at the stature that game the first time they make Kansas City all the ads for positions in the first half\nAnd they came back from ten points down in the fourth quarter to win that game zero exactly right they should have lost that game Kansas City but the game is Casey now and that could be a different story a kid is he's right now is rolling\nI just think that with Kansas City the fence\nAnd they were better last week against ... they played pretty well but I still don't trust and that was the worst defense in NFL history through the first six games that's amazing to me and when your defense isn't\n... good football I don't care what you are often does you can have one game where you're just not quite right\nYou just not into a rhythm got a couple of a third down conversions that don't work out right there down scenarios that don't work out and\nAnd I think that if Denver can keep this game close just stay in it you know maybe control it with running game no Roy screaming that hurts but Philip Lindsey they'll move the ball against that she rushed defense\nIf case ... shows up like every quarter back he was the thing Andy every quarterback has a legitimate chance to have a good day against that sheets defense no doubt about that ... that it\nEnded up ... maybe Eli mainly because I said it's time table him you didn't have the rich kids are playing at the giants of the Washington is giving up a point in that game given up a point\nAnd I'll tell you what I'm going to make the case but my giants but as the giants won six rich because for two giants Los to Atlanta list we buy three twenty three twenty Redskins beat Dallas by three twenty Seventeen and although the giant steak I and I I was born and bred a giants fan as a kid you look at their schedule that bad\nBut all the games except they gave me just a New Orleans saints and that game was ugly village thirty three Eighteen they've been pretty darn close I'm taking the giants to beat the Redskins today in the game in New Jersey I like the giants today although I'm Still thinking it's time to move on from Eli Manning but the point is this who do you move to that's the question\nThem given me props you hear these telling us how about scheduling me a little bit more Fox Sports radio suits with that and my reading between the lines on that Ryan you can take it that way\nYou could say well my name is Wes don't get me in this MIT [laughter]\nAll right let's take a look at last week a Andy not not too hot your window and three who but um [noise] well on the flip side\nBrian [noise] not only\nDid he win for these this week in a row I Can't believe but it's a three and I don't know\nAbout that at the bourbon\nStick you know when it's over there I'm On ... bay manage that tape\nWas unlike the Dodgers I'm of the slump\nIn them I don't mind the Dodgers and he didn't like then come to understand uh uh\nBut any this is your time this is your time to turn this around because we have three whole new bed to go with this week so let's get to go and\nOur first one let's start with the first game of Sunday that is the jaguars and chargers or last week Blake ... got a hook and a quarter Kepler came in and it's up to thirty passes so over under one and a half quarterbacks used by the jaguars in this game Brian we'll start with you\nWow okay so in London taken on the eagles will we see a Cody Kessler appearance that look let me ask you this I don't want to get too geeky on you Ryan later if it's one of these like you know Blake ... gets hurt for a play\nThat counts right yea tactically now what would the sodas Blake portals does he understand or from beginning to end the ball game I'm taking the under I'm right with Blake board all this week\nYou know here's my question shady eagles are rolling up and it's like thirty eight to three sure yet I'm going to look through the garbage time no I mean that's why I'm taking the over because I think either he gets hurt or he comes in the garbage time so I think yes over\nOkay or secondly let's look at the uh the bottom of the NFC West is squaring off this week the one in six cardinals and the one in six forty niners who uh yes over under forty one and a half total points in that game\n[noise] [noise] I like it just standard right there what do you think candy\nYou know what I'm going to go on to I just think these teams is so bad I I don't see them money for forty one point so I'm going to say under the citizens of go under forty one and a half\nWhen they get crazy over here I'm taking the over ... I got a new\nOffensive coordinator with the cardinals in Byron left which no MIke McCoy tendencies you're not going to have is great of a read and be able to anticipate what is going to be called as much might have a much better performance from David Johnson today I'm taking the over I'm feeling ...\nThere we go All right Andrew Chaikin speaking of crazy what's like it'd be Monday Night game which is a the patriots traveling to buffalo which is always the sounds like a a great time for weather on a Monday Night in Buffalo\nOr who has more Tom Brady touchdown passes for Derrick Anderson interception\nIs a good race like this is really great line by you but I I Am going to go with touchdown passes with Tom Brady out but I think ... is going to be playing from behind right they're going to your own ball left and right\nIt could literally it could easily be their interest in where'd you go into\nYou know what I you know I'm going to go my my heart now in my head I'm going to go with ... I just I don't know it's not going to go a Brady I Am\nI'm ready to for another region if you think about Sony Michel who's banged up with the knee injury James Whitey he's a good running back these more of a receiving running may not be playing either yeah but I just don't\nIs that running game I don't the you know they're the on the hand five yard line to the bills which is going to pound that rocky and I think that rate is going to have a handful a touchdown passes so I'll go with him go with him\nYou know what though I just want to get a win I don't really care what I don't know how the procedure says it's depressing it is and I'm depressed right now and it's not good but there look fifty\nIs the most creative losers in the league I'm Brian O'Dea do for him to tell you well about the match on Fox football Sunday state\n[noise]\nMexican native rates may apply\nGuys isn't the time you stepped up your game and the gym and the board room and especially in the bedroom American men are getting saw we have left off drone that our fathers maybe even less in our grandfathers we owe it to them and ourselves to fight back\nWith alpha king from Boris Becker it's never been easier just one small pill a day for a serious boost in total testosterone alpha king is on the rise of G and see what you can claim a complementary bottle by texting rave to eight or nine eight or nine\nMore lean muscle from your workout more energy to power through the day and more passionate drives or you can rule the bedroom it's no wonder thousands of men across America trust alpha king to fuel their performance just tax\nRate to eight or nine eight or nine for your complimentary bottle a thirty five dollar value respond in the next ten minutes for your chance to also smack bottles score our number one performance will be the one answer\nThat's R.

and I've already ... these little quibble was a smart picked at the time he said so when he was an ESPN commentator\nYes and now we've had a chance to work to do with um our Cooper and so your opinions change a little bit\nAs far as being with a player and you know it's interesting my my ... co host on Saturday morning is Tim brown\nAnd Tim has a line to the raiders organization and he revealed yesterday that you know the raiders were concerned that this guy would just disappear in the office he he just wouldn't be there\nThere there be game stretches that go by that um are Cooper's getting one target\nYou know and and you know they think OK also too I just don't know if he ever really one John group is trust I mean ... was saying that sometimes you would start to see Jared Cook the tight end lined up\nFor plays that are more Cooper would normally be running so you know consistency has been an issue for him you know and it also includes drops\nYou know that's been an issue for him as well he's just been an inconsistent player tremendous talent don't get me wrong there's a reason it was picked in the top five but when you're a raiders team is looking ahead to twenty twenty I mean they're not like let's even skipped twenty Nineteen realistically here guys right with the raiders because\nThey're going to be a nomadic team until they get into their new stadium and twenty twenty so\nYou know while they run out the string they know mark Cooper his contract you know he's got one more year on it and twenty Nineteen they weren't going to extend them they do for his part of the long term future so now they get another first round pick I Believe this gives them five first round picks\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty they will be able to rebuild from there are just going to be a long ago again for raiders fans who are just tired of this\nYou know Alex looking at this Sunday night game it's the match up of the week where the saints go to Minnesota and I can't imagine that the last game in the stadium is on the mind of mark his Williams the safety who mid to tackle against the findings\nAnd so I think that his teammates are going to want to pick him up as well do you see at the same way how much of a positive impact could the last game against the Vikings have on this game against the Vikings for the St\nIt could I think there is another issue in the secondary as well but that we do know is going to make an impact and that's the fact that can Crowley they're starting corner opposite of march ... not going to play tonight according to media reports and if he is out I mean the lie apple thrown into the fire immediately and would be making his first start\nFor the saints and that could be you know could there be communication issues\nPotentially and that's not something that you could just because he just got there and so that's not something you want to hear about\nIf you're a saints fan knowing that you got stuff on the oh and Adam feeling by the way on his record setting pace for about an Eighteen NFL season those are the guys that you have to go against with I I get Marcus Williams credit you know he stood up after the game he admitted he made a mistake and it was a huge mistake you\nKnow I don't ever think one player makes a football game that states can go back and look at a lot of it but you know and and say we should have done this we should have done that but you know what his teammates have embrace do I do think that they want to make a statement tonight against the Minnesota Vikings but you know and for the Viking standpoint that\nThey can just keep it running game going and keep a little more about you see that by the way her cousins getting the football out of his hand very quickly but he also ... leads the NFL and passes patted down fourteen of them\nActually a record setting pace for having passes shot you know slapped down so be interesting to see how the Vikings tried to fix that problem and also ...

Gurley they they do running backed by committee and it's not an especially impressive committee to be quite honest with you I think it's a pretty average bunch\nI think the Packers lose this one but you know what all the money a lot of money coming into Las Vegas right now because the rams are nine and a half point favorite a lot of folks are picking up that special here with the Packers I'm not sure if the rams beat him by by nine and a half and how that spreads gonna go but I just think that they ultimately have too much firepower take the over in my opinion on this one\n... there's a lot of off the sealed drama with numerous teams if you go cliff notes version the Jacksonville Jaguars the ads\nFor players detain the whole thing where they allegedly skipped out on a bill in London think about Denver what's going on there this week with Chad Kelly going into a stranger's home and mumbling while the brother of pat bowling filed a court motion to remove trustees from power\nYou look at Sean Jackson requesting a train the browns coaching staff could have changes get all this off the field drama where do you see at translating to on the field with any of the teams that I mentioned\nWell it's funny 'cause you notice that we don't have this with the New England patriots that we know about right and they remain the gold standard of the NFL and its teams that minimizes sort of drama are usually the ones that are successful right I mean you write a whole bunch of things you you mentioned a number of teams right there and the impact that it you know these types of things can have on them and none of them I Believe have a winning record\n\nGangs that gumbo says Sean Hannity is bad for America [noise] Shaun Hannity [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nAt Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you'll want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right and what you said in comparison to public records racial approval only balance or thirty or parts of transactions called for confirmation and conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he said and unless they were thirty thirty additional conditions or exclusion wake up with\nThe Gulf Coast mornings or it's going to be like when Nixon went to China [laughter] this is just this is cultures that have never met John has confirmed that I Will be allowed to introduce term low could live\nA second term will be at the ready to go stay there so this will be all but I think about for one to talk about between ... while\nCould be summit between myself into law this will be\nYes this will be a focus\nWilly should learn from Tony ... says he's willing to learn from the coast\nMornings with Kelly benefits and they'll go and read with traffic and when they're together on the nine six to eight every weekday fondue socked won all four nine W.

said\nThey liked the stars low earth orbit and they'd step on the gas and they're going to have so we'll see if they can continue this momentum\nAnd rod is not going to let them get away with it and we got a to point conversion right there I lose in a girly again why not a when everything else ah and and you know with all the talk about\nMore homes and Drew Brees off as having a gray airfield rivers have a great year for the chargers I'm Sorry the MVP of this league is Todd girlie\nNever give it to anybody other than quarterback from your all ... Peterson got a a MVP ... years ago last time I would have\nGirly sets the NFL record for touchdowns he's on pay\nYou need to set the record for yards to really I mean it's crazy man look a bedroom home or if he continues on the clip he's going to know who watched in\nAll the ... now here's the thing about the NFL awards and a lot of people have always questioned like baseball you know how do you judge most valuable but in the NFL it's different because they have separate awards they have it off ...\nPlayer the year right and the defense of play year and then they have a lower or valuable player noted brutally last\nYear was the often so player of the year but Tom Brady was the MVP rarely seen that many ... uh Drew Brees is twice spin off in support of the year he's never won MVP award\nOr they basically been distributed to the ... the ... the Aaron Rodgers of the world but you're saying the ... Peterson wandering MBP ... Thomas's Sean Alexander in the mid two thousand times you know but the ... year they set the record for ... and the seas\nYeah it's not even that anymore can't just be more most touchdowns I Can't even that no because if you have ... finish out like he's finishing right over five thousand yards and the growth for me as twenty five touchdowns\nYes at the halfway mark okay right so the record pay but if he stays on this clip and yeah fifty touchdown right with and they go fourteen into with\nSix interceptions ... is ... I don't care\nBut time girlie does those numbers will never be\nAble girlie leaves the NFL rush in and scores thirty touchdowns ... thirty\nIs Patrick my home has fifty they're going with the fifty\nFifty touchdown passes as opposed to storing thirty touchdowns\nAnytime a quarterback has thrown fifty touchdown passes you won the MVP ... period\nAll right well let's ask\nYou as a Thirteen year veteran of the national football league is that fair that only quarterbacks be considered\nFor the war is not that it's a quarterback sleek\nAll the hoopla and in conversations are down about Romney bags they're about quarterbacks we just had a whole segment on you can't turn your team back over to James Winston because he\nIs a ... garbage fire right I mean you you can't do it then we're not talking about the money back we're talking about the quarterback position in in order for you to be successful in today's NFL you need some semblance of a dynamic quarterback\nThat's just what it is\nAll right well ... Gurley to me is someone that could still be in the conversation of course you'll be in a conversation who come in second in your Jay Jay why everyone thought he was going to win the ... are you an air Roger still won and run away of course\nBut he still I mean when you look at that I mean here you have more touchdowns in some receivers that year\nPast the fences bad breakup spin the top quarter back and let the league effects\nSo when you when you look at someone who was a game changer in that year for Jay Jay what no one affected the outcome of a game more than he did\nHow do we get here\nYou know I read I called up the rabbit hole enough to remember we're running backs dominated is adding ... ... I mean there was a time\nWhere the Heisman Trophy was one eleven years in a row by a running back ... ... he broke that string I'll let me ... years in a row and now you know even this year my Heisman up to you you got\nBy the way I found something out\n[noise] Alabama quarterback too now I thought you look at his last name and it's spelled tackled by law it's not I've been saying tackled by law because it's T. A. G. O. V. A. I. L. away right by law\nHe goes Congo in fact he actually got ... they said well how do you pronounce your name and he goes\nCongo by law hunger by ...\n... you know right now luger linebacker no no re Mao Luna is the\nProper pronunciation now this blows me away are you into ...\nWell yeah there are people who have been missed ... pronounce my name is Dr head coach of calling me from our bureau hey nice to meet you I'm from\n... hey I'm from I'm like okay [laughter] that was less than a second but I Do go out there I saw Thirteen Years only how many people are so calling you from\n... yeah all the time I I just ignored it just I'm only incorrect we don't have I have [laughter] whatever well my attitude about hunger by law is it'd be washed away with a Heisman Trophy which I Would imagine he's going to consider he has talked about the record is twenty five touchdown passes\nUp by the way down to the game was nine and ... ...\nProbably a twenty five yard touchdown pass scores currently twenty two Thirteen pending\nThe extra point right and if they do and by the way I mentioned at the top of the show even there were like five games this week we're the lines really moved one of them was this game people were hounding the Packers as eight nine and a half point dog in fact the line went down to seven and a half or seven points\nAnd now they're down ten\nAs the rams attack on the extra points so another game was the colds and the raiders game this game started as a pick him suddenly all the money one on the colds as maybe a three and a half point favorite the Colts have now taken a seven point lead so this could be a very tough week for Vegas\nI mean the raiders at me [laughter]\nBy the way speaking of come back we're talking earlier about comebacks J. D. Y. Adrian Peterson ... what about Andrew Luck me today and oh yeah absolutely but who at thirty one three touchdowns from Iranian play last year\nAnd um you know\nFour hundred and sixty ... and they're losing a lot of games but at the same time he is putting up the kind of numbers that we expect a healthy Andrew Luck to put up and he's doing it right now and a gold seen as not very good\nYeah he he's definitely I'm putting them great numbers in the fingers hoping that the him and the coats is the emergence of a running game from Marlon Mac they've never had a running game right with Andrew Luck and\nDoing what and I got drafted Trent abroad and Trent Richard semi right fiasco\nGoodness but it's taken a lot of pressure off ... off of him and he's not having\nTo throw the ball forty five sixty forty five fifty sixty times the game\nHe's right at you know thirty one or temps twenty to completion two thirty nine three touchdown buddies him the ball off thirty four times with two hundred and twelve yard\nThat's the recipe that they need to take some of the pressure off and look and now they're ... they're just got to turn over in the island and the raiders getting ready to go in and score again already of thirty five to twenty eight with for Nineteen left in the fourth quarter\nA in Oakland so it looks like the fourth quarter walls for Oakland continues I think they've been out scored Seventy eight to thirty two and the fourth quarter and that's the worst point differential in the NFL\nAll right so a again a at a balance of games right now if you decided to go all in on the colds and the Packers the culture looking good they're about to up their lead but the Packers seemingly control in that ran defense\nHas really shut down the Green Bay attack I I think that if you are looking at the rams right now a is a a more money for you to go in the third corps so it's not over yet because we seen Aaron Rodgers a way to have ... over the years but if they do at the rams do prevail in this game eight and ... at the halfway point\nAre you still are they the best team are they better than the shootings you are they better than the patriots are they are better than the saints are certainly can't wait for that gave a preview that the Viking saints game a little bit later on but are they the best team in the way\nI Would I Would say so because when you talking about the best team not the best off into the best defense but the best team you see what the rams\nHave in terms of offerings of weapons with you know would cooks\n[laughter] everyone a bigger bigger weapons everywhere but then when you talk about defensive well you know you gotta remember oh keep believe he's out\nBut even even when right now but you got Peters you guys do you got Donald well you have there and\nDone all your exactly\nAnd so when you stack them up against another team they can do it on both sides of the ball and they're one of the few teams in the NFL they're going to make that a\nFight we mentioned we have a a Sunday night game that could well determine who the second best team in the NFC is right now the Vikings hosting the same things have not watched since they're opening game what's gonna transpire in that game plus a little thing called the world series\nWe'll cursed shark keep the Dodgers all live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios yeah so we got all the answers coming up next [noise]\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less sees can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to comment airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim go to auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nIndeed you know it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn boy you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a nurse practitioner for ... years experience acute care certification indeed have the huge pool of amazing candidate and screen or tools that\nHelp you find your most qualified applicants an entire shortlist of unicorn even more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire post your job and ... dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source ...

All right\nMan someone's going to say something about Patrick ... but ah right now yeah the LA Rams are on the move there are only down by one point earlier on today you have the eagles job but on the jaguars twenty four to Eighteen Panthers by Fifteen over the ravens\nAnd we've covered the bangles debacle but they go away and beat the buccaneers by three C ... on the road with the line twenty eight to four team Pittsburgh comes from ought to be the browns thirty three to Eighteen James car two hundred and twelve total yards\nAnd also a parish spores and Patrick moms for total touchdowns missed one three hundred three yards passing Kansas City thirty Denver twenty three guys got some major league baseball in about\nThirty five forty minutes from now from Los Angeles Dodgers looking to avoid elimination Red Sox and Dodgers David Price versus Clayton cursed shah\nThe pitching match up scheduled for eight Fifteen eastern only on Fox where of course the Fox sports ... as well\nTo a girly by the way scored a touchdown and his eleventh straight game lemon straight game I got one better for you yeah every pitch that\nPitch yesterday that the Dodgers gave up and run yes every single one and there were seven pictures you voted out now but here's the amazing thing you're starting pitcher only gave up I hit yeah but at least three Ninety One pitch is yeah but this is a good thing they pulled him out because he said keep an eye on me All right I'll keep an eye on him [noise] I don't get me started\nDon't get me started over focus right now I thank you very much mustard gas kind of a company life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios eases eight fifty percent or more on your car insurance guy go go to guy could I\nComment call eight hundred not force of an auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier I so we got three forty to go the rams\nAre in great position a nice run by Todd girlie as idiot yards rushing eighty one yards receiving that's a hundred and sixty nine yards from scrimmage and his second in ten and again the rams are trailing\nTwenty seven twenty six you know part\nOf what's going on and if you're the rams right now oh you're in a pretty good position amount but you don't you got to run some clock right All right and you don't want to give the ball back to Aaron Rodgers\nSo a golf scrambles she slides there's a flag could be a whole on the rams\nLet's see if this one's coming back\nA little scramble or inside the ten your life for golf or waiting for the flag\nAnd they're going there it is pretty much obvious when you have the quarterback suddenly scramble and the flag drops that's probably a whole probably already All right so that's going to move the rams back but that's not necessarily bad for the rams again there are only download point obviously and feel gold position that means they'll probably run a little more\nClock right now the only thing that would make me feel good about running clock as if it has zero or with Aaron Rodgers\n[laughter] I mean I mean how many hail man he's the king of the Hail Mary king of the hill I mean\nNobody throws the better Hail Mary so will the rams are backed up to the twenty three yard line second in twenty three and a half minutes to go in this game and the rams are trailing by one and they are running\nAs no surprise that all round the clock down some more tiger early continued to pile up the yards um\nSo when I when I get back to the saints Vikings game anybody in the ... or a bar in the injuries or anything else is this team basically take it into the super bowl there not ticket but they have a good shot the um\nIs there and in the last year they lost at home in their first playoff game rise chalk that up to inexperienced but is there anything you could see the ... I mean look potentially they might have to face a\nAn Aaron Rodgers or you know uh Drew Brees or something like that in the first round again the games will be at the coliseum most likely I third in sixteen or right now and they're running the ball\nSo that's what they're doing they're killing clock or just a part of a game I don't like but again there's two forty to go I mean I don't I don't my plan for fuel goes\nWell you and especially when you're going to give two minutes of the very least I'm Aaron Rodgers and all my mom says\nOh man I'm like that what happened\nWhat happened was ... I mean does he understand that Aaron Rodgers on the other team you're going to give Aaron Rodgers at least two minutes\nOr wouldn't do this for all he needs is a field goal to win the game I wouldn't do it I Would have gone for the end zone\nAll right so the rams are attempting a forty three yard field goal again the clock is ticking out of the two minute warning to kick his good so the ranch take eight twenty nine twenty seven laid there is too old five which is even better for the Packers lose either get added a bonus of the\nTime and it was happening with the forty niners oh my goodness\nThey're over beds map [laughter]\nIt is over so the Arizona Cardinals are too and and the forty niners and oh it's six against everyone else is so good for Larry Fitzgerald like they just won the super bowl yeah that's what it feels like so Josh Rosen on that that was an impressive come from behind when\nThe touchdown pass was right on the money so the Arizona Cardinals there was another game the forty niners we mentioned uh were favored on the road as a one\nAnd sixteen did not look at that's now are you kidding me\nWhat the heck is that CJ better running for his life and just threw it away\n[laughter] um if if you have a center that football and here's what people don't understand she we we watch these bad plays and you know guys making mistakes and everything else\nBut you spent Thirteen Years in the NFL in the film room with your coaches reviewing bad place\nHow's the play like that covered by the offensive line cook goes crazy [laughter]\nI mean what I mean what do you have a curse words curse words and and you have to just sit and take it\nOr only the ... ... oh on the kickoff return learning that alcohol level Green Bay ... on the Gulf or they're looking\nRight now to see it and it is rooms ball on believable\nI'm fifty six seconds left on your on oh\nMy oh my\nSo let's wants to play again or issues ball is\nNot much doubt that is clearly now out of it and you basically\nWe know you would have had\nTwo minutes with Aaron Rodgers just again a goal I Know he's going crazy over there and now he would go in this game Aaron Rodgers new waiting on the lookout Lucy's carrying that\nBall wrap it up are you kidding me\nFirst of all I Want to just let the ball go out of the end zone why return it why were children at all ... look at look look\nGoing crazy looking Rogers won't crazy absolutely losing his mind he knew he was going to win that game\nSo the rams look like they're going to skate barring some disaster a leading twenty nine twenty seven and Aaron ... that was his job security right now among ... yeah [laughter] ... pretty much the only running back ...\nAnd ... well yeah so are there you go to Montgomery fumbling\nRight away how how does the ...
