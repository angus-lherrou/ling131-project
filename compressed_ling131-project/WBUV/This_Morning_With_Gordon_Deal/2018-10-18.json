Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main thing that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people who earn enough to hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one week and it's still I'm practically and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though ... dollars from our state are going to find these things and you know across the country [laughter] one argument for why that had happened by mail initiative is there\nNeither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting the political CARE Act but if they are voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen grabbing Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece entitled midterms healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level\nOr could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with health care reporters that he thinks these initiatives he's found that shit is in these states passed that it it could start a trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that had an expanded Medicaid but conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Fort will care I don't like such as imposing work requirements and that's another issue that tip play some states might be willing to extend medicate if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're seeing that truck sample in um Kentucky okay\nYeah you've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about an issue because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it there's in state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money would there be a guarantee that there would be there at\nThe way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guaranteed the states that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their their argument is that states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion ten states you're going to be on their own\n...

county were Mexico beach is located\nWhile the city of about twelve hundred people is unrecognizable now because of the destruction locals are assessing damage in considering the options for rebuilding homes and businesses what they don't want\nPie rises and the spring break party atmosphere of places like Panama City beach Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit John what'd you witness\nBut I was down in Mexico Beach Florida which was pretty much ground zero for hurricane Michael and that hurricane came ashore or we can go as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S\nAnd the kind of our this storm was packing or you could really see the results of bad at Mexico beach um it's it's almost hard to imagine what it once was\nIf you had never seen it before the storm because it's just wreckage everywhere uh you know there's really no building that was it affected in some way\nAnd plenty of buildings that were just completely destroyed there are a you know small cottages and houses that were just wiped clean and there's nothing left but a slab and maybe the tile floor and then the rest of the house is just the pieces all over the place\nBoy I think you said in your story too is the older homes right ones that are decades old fifty years plus maybe that took the worst of the beating\nThat's what the locals were telling us is that you know the city had a bunch of smaller cottages\nOh there were quite lovely but we're older and probably created some of the modern codes and they did not handle the weather well and um\nYou know it was I was a ... we're talking about a storm that came to show a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds and also a devastating search a water pushed in quite far and the combination of water and when and bring these houses was just too much of\nOne of her some folks saying that they are determined to rebuild or some saying I Can't take this anymore I'm going inland where this is not as much of a threat what are you hearing\nWell first of all um there's a few people there\nBecause the uh um it it's really almost habitable right now there's no electricity power lines draped over the place for water doesn't work there aren't really sure whether they're going to get basic services back and there are security checkpoints the wedding people in that have very limited so don't care\nBut certainly there are some people in town\nBut allowed in to go to their homes and businesses and what I heard from them as they really do want her to be\nVery eager to talk about what Mexico beach was like before the storm hit\nAnd the fact that they are really really interested in getting it back to that and what they describe is really a kind of small town feel um you know a quaint clay a place that um you know through a zoning rules tried to keep away the high rise those successfully kept away high rises\nAnd we really didn't have the kind of a you know spring break beach party atmosphere but uh you know some other cities and towns are now I'm sure you know and they're very eager to try and reclaim that Ken\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter John camp [noise] he's written a piece titled after hurricane Michael residence determined to rebuild shattered city he paid a visit to Mexico beach which took the brunt of hurricane Michael that came ashore on October ten anybody saying boldly I guess that it's not worth rebuilding a small town like this\nI did not hear that from the local um ... we spoke with a credit to former I'm Sheena administrator and you know he did he do bench met 'em as he sat on the back row level that makes sense\nUm but uh when you get down to the community level it's very hard to say let's just abandon a place because it's been destroyed and just\nYou know I think time will tell in terms of whether it will take to actually get this place up and running and utilities restored showing that you can actually make the place where the ball game will go a long way okay and you know it\nWas bad was it was there are people there right now\nIn terms of first responders and do you know government officials are picking up debris starting to clean up individuals are they're carrying things out of harms of business but they're trying but they want to salvage by the arm load people put the stuff into trash tells me that\nThe cleanup workers under way it's just going to take a really long time\nYou get the sense that any a large developers are circling like vultures thinking that this would be the time to build that high rise that Mexico beach has tried to avoid because they can create a building that can stand a hundred and Seventy five mile an hour winds for example\nThat's a great question and I don't know if any developers are actually circling yet I suspect it would be hard for them to make it through the security checkpoint\nAt this point I think John's Wall Street journal reporter John camp paid a visit to Mexico beach

are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank ... ... what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending job for buried reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in what is otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been in four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but we did to reverse the trend we at the where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we'd seen uh several years prior to that\nYou represented in the ... remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up of the last few years that was initially when we started looking at this show five or five years or so ago\nThat was the top ... and people limited they're spending it was the cause their incomes weren't going up we noticed over the past several years though is that as\nA income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case where that was the reason people voting back and instead people were saying quoting back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that bear watching um the percentage of Americans\nTo point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this in the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment\nThat better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people are they're starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we\nThe even an assault economy there there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back a ... you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending an inclination to shave more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend hand are also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on spending Gen x is not far behind um similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want more money\nBut that's where it changes the baby boomers those on the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nAnd much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say oh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nCertainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nToward saving they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of that stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of voter millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had an effect and we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it that that focus on saving
