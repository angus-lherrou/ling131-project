about the millions of tons of garbage in the patch the ocean cleanup project has sent out a giant floating trash collector to try to scoop it up it's a daunting task to do the patch includes about one point eight trillion pieces of trash\nAnd waste eighty eight thousand tons the equivalent of five hundred jumbo jets\nAnd while many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others day most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean it's a story by Doyle rice science writer at USA Today toil tells about the patch\nIt's about like the solid mass it's about like eh it's not like a ... seat from an airplane or from space because a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little\nA lot of it is broken down at a rather small pieces so when you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge and you can't like you know it's it's about this Bob of something that's like a solid by any stretch it's kind of spread out over an area about twice the size of Texas\nGoodness gracious uh do um currents play a role in sort of keeping\nIt altogether as in weather patterns things like that\nMainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just a scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean Abbott it eventually it's kinda like in the bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collection one area\nAnd that's what's happened here that that it's a a ... that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific just ends up circling together and did this one maps and I said there's other jai hours in the Indian Ocean\nAnd and the Atlantic ocean and so this is this is one of several around the world around\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess\nAnd yeah it's all humans it's a you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties or Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a it's just all of us around the world um and dumping plastic not disposing of properly\nAllowing it to just slow out into the ocean I'm this particular patch or it's probably mainly uh from Asia uh they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trash is from China\nIndonesia the Philippines and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor it's not we're not completely blameless but we are overall doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around the world so\nThat that is that wind up in there if if if let's say that China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage plastic garbage from around the world you know 'cause other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries would ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we was shipped them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you know see no evil well you know it's we've ship it there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just dumping into the ocean\nAh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world as over the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping it a China\nWe're speaking with Doyle rice science reporter at USA Today his piece is called where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from\nAnd how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that are ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going

project which is a very noble and nobody knows what he's saying you know necessarily that it's not a good thing but that it's this project developed by a another one's company a very young guy started it about a few years ago he was Eighteen at the time\nAnd it's the ocean cleanup project and he's invented this a kind of this large scooping mechanism that he and some of his colleagues there believe will uh\nWill actually be able to soak up for school up a lot of this trash and the ocean if it's successful we'll go out and to tackle the actual patch later this year at ... years to come or having
