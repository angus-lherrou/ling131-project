B. B.\nMorning workout you are listening to America's news this morning\nThat if we can\nGet along with ... thanks for joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... distill the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere at four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent down I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that is a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be deeper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adults I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a shift for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful and slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nHum with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sentiment that it has been in the past\nAnd I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates of negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who's refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a moral has a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing up price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of these more expensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver\nA New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production so\nWhat does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on it are going to reflect that right away prices are still high um but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war as and cash buyers and the real frenzy that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust our prices down were to bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the

C. [noise] and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural district and it's still very dominant role district and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to state and money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story ... absences that would be a huge one\n[noise] yes and that's it and other unexpected benefits at some of these districts initially going into it to save money are saying wow you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher actions as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and\nHours and you know at some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they when they were all five days if they were already feet in the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still to base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's\nA bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap day care and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts you use it for a day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended

hear that report on our website this morning with Gordon Deal dot com or on places like SoundCloud I ... just search for this morning [laughter]\nWhere do we stand on the Trump terrorists Yahoo Finance columnist strict new man has been doing a deep dive by talking to business owners on the front lines and joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of a battery business in Texas\nIn surveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight as to get their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who runs a company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment or Alternator isn't starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit for he's a he sees the tears from both sides so um he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment\nBut he also favors the terrorists because he competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China so the price of the competing product is going to go up\nAnd he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him rage his own prices eventually him pay for the higher costs cheese and himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as a symbol if some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\n[noise] it's a I think the ones that are affecting him that cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases they're paying eight or ten percent tariff now an additional temperature works on the twenty five percent tariff also the steel and aluminum tariffs\nA flight and not just to imports from China but from most countries so a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ten percent\nJohnny need to pay ten percent more for that product and at some point he's going to have to raise his own prices\nAh in order to cover that increasing costs but you know there if you're if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well as my customers are going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully\nRaise my prices without of sending my customers away\nSo what he plans to do is he going to eat the ad and cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also and he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's gonna raise prices so ah all prices what kind of go up at the same time\nWe're sticking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the tariffs\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about this she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before\nHe got the notification from his own supplier that his own costs you are going up by the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn a because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact um I got notified by my own suppliers my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the trend terrorists are and what are the point she made is that it his business he has seen a lot of the U.S businesses small businesses such as his own just disappear\nBecause ah they cannot compete with\nA with cheap imported products from China and I'm In many cases they make the case that the court in products are low quality products that there\nAre there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consumer you're getting something inferior but a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know ... you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products\nSo he's one of these people who feels that the Trump parents may actually rectify a longstanding problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThanks that's Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman's\nPortion of the program is ... by Harry's you've heard Gordon talked for years about

market the Dow fell you know more than a hundred points on Wednesday so it's easy to get caught up in that but the truth is if you're a relatively young investor you should you know play the long game as history has shown and not get overly panicked about every bad day that the market has\nWhat the problem with constantly checking all your accounts\n[noise] the thing is you know most of us are probably not going to be getting the money out of the account that day so what you're the number that your account says can either be really exciting or really disappointing but the truth is it's probably far off from what it will be when you actually cash account out\nI'm at is different obviously for someone that's retiring tomorrow or has another really short term goal but if you are

anything but that\nAnd with interest rates rising this time now to pay off debt if you can\n[noise] exactly so we are going to the interest rates probably rise several times this year or so um do you want to get ahead of that before your credit card is charging you even more and interests so if you can pay off as much as you can now that will really path later\nOn the positive side of higher interest rates some banks may be paying better rates\nYes that's true so um if you're looking for a new bank account um or even if you're not you probably should just see that they're really great
