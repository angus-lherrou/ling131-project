expectations of winning back the house and can defy the odds to take control of the Senate but for some smoke signals about President Trump's reelection chances\nTo swing state governor races will offer tantalizing clues about the public's tolerance for progressive is when the alternative is electing Kennedy to emulate the attitude of the president's so says Josh cross harp politics editor at National Journal Josh how do you see it\nWhen you want to look at how a twenty twenty presidential election might shape up\nIt's really instructive to look at the sort of ... right governor's race is taking place in swing diverse battleground and I'm Talking about Florida\nGeorgia and even Arizona to a to a lesser extent where you have you know in in the in the Florida race you've got to Bernie Sanders candidate running against the Trump endorsed Republican it's a Florida is one of the votes a bellwether state for the country and the race is extremely close\nIf someone like Andrew Gillum ... will be the first African American governor Florida\nIf if if he wins that race and he's a very progressive candidate he would send a message to Democrats and twenty twenty ... we can win\nThe electoral college we can win the presidency with a very liberal candidate against against President Trump there there's a cop with a victory even nominate someone who is a little bit outside the mainstream ...\nMm So is the same thing true in Georgia where you've got Stacey Adams running\nAbrams yet Georgia is a a another great example where you have two candidates claimed to shoot at bases\nAre ... you know in the primary especially was talking about how she wanted to build a new coalition\nOf voters in Georgia not just relying on sort of a swing\nSuburban Atlanta voter that ought to make up the difference in ... Georgia election\nShe wanted to get new are largely African American voters to the pole and create a new electorate or to help Democrats wet and it's a big battle for big gamble she definitely has that are backing that good democratic year but she's running neck and neck with the Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nWho was again a Trump endorsed candidate someone who's very very conservative especially on social and cultural issues and uh you know there's also a big battle over over voting rights and and the state where I'm you know he he had secretary of state camp one after Abrams for something to organize and trying to get new voters registered to vote in the future so\nAgain this is a polarized election leopards is right in a state that is the lead legal Republican but it's one of those states Democrats like they can compete in in years to come\nAnd speak with Josh across our politics editor at National Journal these pieces called battle of the bases will set tone for twenty twenty you point out in the story too about the risk of running left\n[noise] yeah I mean the the connection with them and I I I buy the conventional wisdom is that when you go too far to go after going to alienate those swing moderate voters a typical it makes a difference in in competitive elections that were Democrats are betting on it I I can understand why what what area of the cases they think this is\nSuch a good democratic environment there's such you know here ... anti Trump anger\nEspecially among suburban voters that it may not matter who Democrats nominate they might be able to nominate someone who is a little bit\nTo the left are but the suburban motors are so so ah you know\nHave such a problem with President Trump they look at the Republican Party and wonder where it's going and let me just wrote straight democratic ... vote on a strict party ticket and the Democrats so environment if you want to have a candidate that's going to be a little more productive than normal this is the type of political environment Democrats would work with a would achieve that goal\nThat gets to I Believe your point about this competing culture clashes you call it in the Trump era\nI mean this is the middle of this you know the the time for centuries the timer moderation is is that here and twenty chain which Trump is rallying his base\nDemocrats are playing to the resistance and there's not much room for for something like a like a stone Brett if it was a former Democratic governor in Tennessee you're trying to run to the middle or he's finding that it's hard to to to the center of the people who want to take sides on the left ...\nExplain what's happening in Arizona than that so somewhat similar maybe to Florida in Georgia\nYet this race Doug do see the Republican incumbent ... he's not as Trump beat it to the two other Republican so it's a little bit different\nBut again running against a guy who are they what they would go see it would be the first Hispanic governor in Arizona and in over forty years and go see it again on especially immigration which is a very touchy issue in Arizona where they're ... they're much more conservative on
