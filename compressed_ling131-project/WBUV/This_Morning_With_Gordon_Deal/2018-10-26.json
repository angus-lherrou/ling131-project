October statistically is no worse than any other month but it it said a month at some point to extremes\nA lot of bad things happen in October and a lot of good things happened October it's a it's a month when things go up and down a lot why that is I think it's just the luck of it\nAnd the trends right now a ... big these big tech firms have been kinda carrying the load when it comes to the uh the rise for the indices\nAnd they have but it's important to bear in mind that the indices and not particularly high even before the recent for all of the show for the city over the last twenty five years\nOn traveling um twelve months a earnings as average twenty five\nOr which would imply four percent rate of return uh right now which trading at about ... to ... or ... corporate profits up so much this quarter and likely to continue rising although not at the same pace because this quarter was characterized by the extra boost\nFrom the tax cuts are still rising there's no reason to believe that the markets overvalued\nYou said in the piece that virtually every hot tech company of recent years faces new challenges you mentioned Facebook Twitter ...

met flicks is being investigated by the wall Street Journal or for it's for its workplace practices or it's work environment a but it's important to remember you know when the market was up here

investors pay more attention to all lined companies which are doing very well right now\nWe're speaking with Peter Morici economists and business professor at the University of Maryland He's written a piece titled harrowing times for stock investors so to that point you said on the market will have to get his girl from more traditional companies how's that going to happen\nWell I think that the the the investors will rotate is they recognize that the tech companies have had difficulties also\nStocks have outperformed bonds by you know two to one no problem over the last twenty five years so well right now people are starting to dump into bonds should recognize\nThat the potential profit squares in stock is just larger and when they go back the stocks or they might not invest show heavily in an Amazon and so forth but rather to look at Macy's for example\nWhat about uh the fed in interest rates how does that factor in here\nNow that's a big question more uh I I think that the fed itself and uh you know the various participants over there and private economists recognize that we're in a world where the natural rate of interest to the neutral rate of interest is about three percent perhaps a little less\nAnd the ... shark has them over shooting that I think they're going to if they have to pull back from that\nUh this notion that we're going to raise interest rates until we get there but not knowing where there is they know where it is it's true rate increases away whether it's not over through two years or three and it's time to sort of a either slow down or recognize that the limits about three percent so the market is so panicked by their behavior\nIs Peter Peter Morici economists and business professor at the University of Maryland\n... as long as you buy\nRecruiter

that for decades other countries have rigged the system so Americans pay more he says Americans are now going to pay the price as other countries pay\nHow could that work we're joined now by ... and president and founder of GDP advisors ... is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's actually possible for where the president can control certain things so specifically the proposal that ha just outlined targets Medicare's reimbursement of specific drugs that are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nFor cures roughly forty percent of all drugs in the United states but it is the consumer of these drugs therefore\nSays under mandated law how it's going to pay for these drugs has has the power to go back and say this is all the Medicare is going to pay for these drugs [laughter] this is how it's going to work and doctors that are prescribing and and the ministry of these drugs are only going to get paid to some out\nOkay so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\n[noise] that's the argument that they're already making on the heels of this announcement is that a visual style and their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements are\nOf their cars and this is a great step in the right direction I think upset for a long time that the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer uh and and how they're paying for drugs and\nWhat President Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S pays in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries\nThe challenge here though is that it's it's what the us pays that helps subsidize the what the other countries do at the end of the day this is still a profit margin issue for drug manufacturers\nRight All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing\nThe federal government has a consumer\nYeah I I don't think it's anti free market for that water part because the federal government in this case is a prince is the consumer the government is not setting here the government\nIt's just saying what they will pay for these drugs and show in in this we can't remember the specific to doctor administered drug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff [noise] this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs all ready and the government's just saying we're not going to pay as much now this is also a problem because it's the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically what this is targeting Medicare part B is actually the\nPiece of Medicare reimbursement is and it pays doctors a commission for ministry and they struck the traditional Medicare part D system which is a prescription drug plan to get out of the wheelchair when there's an\nUnintended adverse incentive for doctors to do a administered drugs to prescribe drugs and this challenges that at face value\nAnd we're speaking this morning with ... and he's the president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drugs or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nA couple of key things one is and it's just absolutely pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumers subsidize the rest of the when it comes to drug\nChallenges you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug to market and that is largely based on FDA requirement upbringing that drug now\nIn order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that\nThe U.S patent all also gives factors a twenty year patent\nThose manufacturers are really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer to this is a complex issue and we really weren't caught this is a great first step but we also much reduced the regulatory requirements are bringing trucks market soften that allow foreign testing\nUh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce that cost so you can have more competition and let the free market do what it does best innovate and compete\nOr some say a hey these CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies are not millions and millions that's part of the problem is that true or not\nWell listen I mean it goes to the bottom line right and and and you can make the argument that CEOs making millions and millions of dollars and that's the market value for those CEOs and this is this is the\nConflict in a capitalistic society when it comes to health care and I'm a free market capitalist but if if if a pharmaceutical company feels like it's necessary to pay their people that much [laughter] well that's what the market provides show until we start to have a more consumer driven style market with in the healthcare system to try costs down", "year": "2018",
