own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments in so doing negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd sold to minors spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever it doesn't feel right I don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or\nWe're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest has an effect would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people\nCall me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really\nIs not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nOn a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is the complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it's it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world\nIt builds up it accumulates and spirits needs to be dealt with you know sometimes are already in the homes from time to come into the home they sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it may be a professional but have it cleared out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nA and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner oh carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there

helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or loss\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAccidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and the center yourself and realize\nThat you're not now but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's finance and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain for I'm In the past two that's why it's such a an interest in and out of the coyote trust and an impact and thought that it mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a CAT scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how do you begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pat patients has to take notice fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress a negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nMeditate exercise ... a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas a trigger for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident\nNow your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different you know 'cause they could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation um and also\nDo a lot of self nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside\nUm learn you know is a complete sentence with paper because I'm past don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining and and so if you're not able to say no\nNo I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're\nCriticizing me you know whatever you know the types of energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make all of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in
