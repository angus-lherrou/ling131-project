customers save more money staples\nThe biggest publicly traded companies are increasingly limiting their spending on the elections and other political activity\nA new report by the center for political accountability\nStudies annual political spending policies as it would be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers or either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related use to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing your\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always had lobbied I've always felt a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the\nIdea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that something big companies are actually voluntarily saying\nYou know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates but they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party\nA you know the Democratic Republican governors or accept that basically support ah getting governors one party or the other\nOr if they're similar groups for attorney general on for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money number one or more area\nWell I'm speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase a backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies\nHave been in the ass ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a how and where and when they spend ... and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used that published a report on their political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than they used to be um fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining they asked me five hundred index fewer companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their uh to display the political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies have been an index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies reference to Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on political spending in talking to me they said their position hasn't changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like fiber one she fours twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they tell their trade associations not to use their funds for a electorate activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the this organization the center for political accountability but then also uh some\nShareholder activists or shoulder advocates\nHave put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know I asked her older tape much tell the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either see and how those votes go over time or just on their own initiative\nGoaded the investor and said look what's hash out at the so that you remove this project proposal and we\nAgree to some

[noise] how about a ebbs and flows as I Do know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that does that happening\nNot really I mean we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nAh we're we're cool arguing that a high camp is suffering from\nSupport for cap and all that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been pointing to as a reason that she's a falling behind there but it is a state that the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are\nA where Hillary Clinton won for example the Democrats and it will in states that Donald Trump won a Wii Remote and send you well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe mansion still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ships\nWere speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in total where the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month or we started getting really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money into those races which means that those races will become even more solidly whatever color they were training in the first place so I guess we're going to see some of that really this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats\nOn election night which will determine control of this and that I think the house\nPretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that's a Jew ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about are the odds of one party claiming the house and the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in but eventually it is the Republicans I bought one in ... chance of holding the house the Democrats have about a one in five chance of taking the Senate\nOkay so you were to it like the some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nWhat's remarkable about the governance Morial races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of politically areas where the Democrat and Republican or wanting sort of even\nIf you look at that map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is usually going to win reelection\nRight so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for reelection even though it's a blue state and there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the Senate side\nSo you're going to see 'em a fewer ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election\nBut another too is that there is obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump\nBut like the job Larry Hogan is doing and in another a Republican governors that represent blue states actually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on his cabinet nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do as a governor you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip bump at the Washington Post\nWorks on the program is ... by our friends at Harry's up in a Harry's\nUser for years now my favorite part is this leak candle in the ... comfortable shave you get each time my son was a teenager now uses Harry's my father's a user that's three generations of my family\nFor a limited time only new customers can save big on a Harry's shapes that with a good deal at Harry's dot com get a five bleed razor waited handle shaved Jill and troubled cover for just three bucks oh and free shipping\nHarry's bought a world class blade factory in Germany where they grind steel into sharp durable blades and they stand behind the quality of their products do if you don't love your shade let them know they'll give you a full refund\nFor a limited time only Harry such a special offer for listeners of our program new customers get five dollars off a starter said from Harry's\nWith the code deal at ... dot com that's H.

severe less severe but it will be here who is nasty which means now it's time to get vaccinated let's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about them if you're older than six months of age\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't wash Britain virus this nasty virus ...

last year uh not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season the odds that or a crystal ball it's cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I Would have tried to anticipate or is this going to be a bad one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza
