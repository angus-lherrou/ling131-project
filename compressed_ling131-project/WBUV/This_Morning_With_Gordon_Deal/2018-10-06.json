always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system has taken over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nI had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not\nAnd so there's the self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be beliefs of the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now nobody shameful details it's you know facts as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical person they're they're visible press that something happened to me\nLet's talk about um the victims who actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives employing a like that does that make it that much more complicated\nYes especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are\nAnd so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation\nI'm but you're also scared of enough after five so I you know will people again in this victim blaming society what people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some

business I mean it's it has like any business as cycle has ups and downs but you know we've been able to we've been here sixteen years now\nUm we grew from we started Ashley I started with\nA thousand dollars in five thousand papers um every two weeks and so now we do thirty thousand papers a week so that you know like there's like there's a market here and we're still feeling that\nThat market though that said you're still dealing with things like ... digital advertising things like that that or or that are tough to compete with sometimes\nAre there similar productions in communities across the nation that you can compare yourself with I Know in New Orleans when I Lived there back in the day they had something called gambit I have no idea of the game but it's still going but are you a a common item in most marketplaces a weekly newspaper\nAnd yeah and they start at ... and they\nHoliday papers and had an alternative weekly or alternate ed\nThe daily newspaper\nAnd you know a lot of papers\nAre a lot more political or are they have a certain political land or\nAnd or had a heavy into a any have her age I say I kind of coverage and you know we you know we started out\nAs more of an art\nAnd entertainment paper but as you know\nOur market are specific market changed it has been lost our daily paper and a lot of well let me have works at ... at his changed with the changing

there are other alt weekly and and the local hospital\nNow did you say Rob that I hear you say that you guys started sixteen years ago we did All right at that point let's see sixteen years ago I don't remember exactly\nBut certainly the Internet was waking up certainly the thought of online uh advertising was beginning and let's say for sure ten years ago we would certainly was\nIf you were to uh go back sixteen years knowing would you do today\nAbout the marketplace about on line about what you think your competitors are today versus then what would you guys do differently\nWe probably should have been a little bit more ah a little quicker to get when you get our website Go when we for a long time didn't have a very modern website we didn't really responsible with a whole lot\nThat said you know I think probably what we we should have done a little earlier is that a little bit easier earlier on than we were um that we would have helped us and\nAnd I think a big part of a forest but Webb goes you know because I realized that\nIf the temper your expectations or whatever that you know Web advertising for newspapers is not really that great and um it has not been that great and and especially seeing you know that has a road\nTremendously for a\nFor a lot of newspapers and is it seen a lot of it go to Google and Facebook\nSo around you and I'm not sure I'm clear on what you're saying Web advertising for newspapers to find that for a guy outside of the industry what does that mean\nThat means that people advertising on your website ... versus in print or or in concert with in\nPrince and you know we've not seen you know for us the digital advertising has never and and this was the same for for almost every newspaper visual advertising has not\nBeen anywhere close to what you still get input even though most newspapers especially dailies the solutions down\nAre not what they were um advertising out what it was a little for a lot of large newspaper ... bill print is is still a much larger component of what to do in the digital\nSo even though the the the rumor is let's say in the marketplace to print is going away print is still the king and those that have print operation is is that right\nYeah it it still makes for more money\nYeah who is the leader of a print newspaper who grabs it puts it in their hand what do you know about the demographics of those readers\nYou know it's you know for a for instance our our average readers somewhere in the late forties and you know who lives in in town as a professional but that's the average um you know some of those surveys and studies obscene suggests that for\nMe to use a newspaper\nThat they still prefer in at any age group they still are the print media over these digital that newspaper\nYou know so there you go to the website for one thing to ... to ... days like that that they prefer still have that there's a paper in their hand for those who are still using it period you know in that and there's a lot of people who just addressed the often to the ...\nYeah I Know who do you think if if you could compare yourself to something new to you aspire to be what is your newspaper despite her to be do you do you say your sights on something out there and see if we can move this direction or we would be doing great do you ever do you ever put something out like that\nI mean our ... our
