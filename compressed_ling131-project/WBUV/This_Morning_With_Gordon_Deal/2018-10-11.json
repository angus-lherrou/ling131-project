was Michael\n... yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the u._s. do tend to either hold serve or the week it a little bit as they approach land but Michael is\nIntensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was was making it for [noise] so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and do they give you a perspective on that\nAre there are only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record in Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened hereby rain\n[laughter] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a or your Augusta, Georgia and it spread it all of the rain into a part of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and over the next twenty four hours it'll just move pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nIn the southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a show these New England we produce an inch rain or so on its northern playing ... to a New York city of Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a of the places where Michael did he get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa or they need Houston uh shows it's\nIt's a relatively lower population swam in the floor ... still hit very hard but ah I guess if there is a small solace of relief or certainly as far as the the the the overall damage figure from this is that it hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nOr why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that that shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so uh so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this that you just put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance of but\nI think the intensity the ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect a borderline get five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations and what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks [laughter] well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left are typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not to worry about it was the\nUh there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats\nOver the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons do can go into November we still could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November I mean that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the the worst of the hurricanes the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still get big hurricanes and tropical storms early in the seat in the late in the city but uh there's certainly a prime time it's almost like the kind of race in baseball I almost mats of exactly with that\nGood
