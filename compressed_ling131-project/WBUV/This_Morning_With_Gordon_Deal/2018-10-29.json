things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrienne Adrienne sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away

that happen when people are falling asleep or waking up and sleep ... thing is Gary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise]\nYou know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know and that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of spiritual reality or\nMaybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages\nGoing through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to put a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um you know that this is a an order of magnitude that\nWe simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a dropping this and some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts and so you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome and ... times to the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail

packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski took

Google are rigged to favor the political left and now he's building a twenty twenty campaign infrastructure that can circumvent them Alex Thompson national political reporter at political got the scoop Alex what's up here\nI think the twenty sixteen campaign that's been praised for some of their innovative look at how they use Facebook in particular\nAnd I was surprised to find after talking with people involved the reelect that actually they are planning on using Facebook in the same way and that's a lot of people felt that reliance on Facebook and twice exchange with a little bit of a weak ass on that part\nThat they thought as something they had to do because they were being outspent by Hillary Clinton and because you know there was one of the ... the campaign was put together but now they declared for reelection they ought to be the paperwork\nOn inauguration day and twenty Seventeen they now have several years of the time and they use that in order to um you know or to figure out a way to not ... have put nearly as much the next time around\nAnd you know among the post Facebook strategy and that is going to be a lot of mobile first and it's going to be a lot of direct and Schumer\nWhich means a lot of ... a lot of emails and a lot of other channels that we still probably don't even know about yet Mm\nSo mobile versus not exactly a breakthrough technologies these days what are they going to do something different\n[noise] um well the main thing that they're doing which is a little bit different it is corn that they're using Chang but the way that you're you're going to be able to do it is new but the growth of peer to peer tech messaging which basically allows\nHuge attack message people with out them ever having to opt ten and you've seen this off election

Facebook differently this time because he said they're still spending money there right\nYeah actually there were among the biggest spenders even though they are up for reelection for two more years

contact people off wind so\nIn a way to orbit the spending all this money now so they can contact them off the popcorn later you know people still are as as long as people still use Facebook\nThey are probably going to stop spending money on it\nBut there's also a deep distrust of the plot for among conservatives some people said the ... the you know the concerns raised a little bit of a equal crying wolf they don't really believe it but I can tell you from people that I talk to him but the Trump reelect there is a really deep suspicion that\nFacebook will not be nearly as powerful tool for

opponents who have we didn't decades for a reliably\nConservative Supreme Court or knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after he historically partisan confirmation fight the justices may not answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing ... funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nThen mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they're likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases has swat them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was\nAt the federal circuit court federal appeals court we are going to let that stand [noise] so that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nAre still the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where\nCircuit courts those are the federal appeals court for the love of right below the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit porch and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts May of ...\nIn one way on an issue and one or two or three circuit courts have ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come into court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court\nAnd might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can\nSay we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another\nLet's say because it's often the case that anti abortion plaintiffs those bringing the case\nOr want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... uh but uh twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw\nA certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw abortions that are undertaken cuts of particular reasons like the ... or the disability if the fetus\nThe court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and\nThat doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took\nA on the subject of the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago it had to do with the Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers\nThanks rich USA today's
