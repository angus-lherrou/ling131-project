September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cool slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com ... what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to the air and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment at our country and ... been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers ah but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with more cameras senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one that's an average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWhether when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that a ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer but it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go a\n... you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend it and other words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nBut I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the

[noise]\nAnd uh [noise] from what I gather it was about Fifteen minutes wrong and President Trump spoke for the vast majority of those fifty minutes and you know the phone call was described to me I could just picture his voice right you know\nTalking about how beautiful how excellent things are going to be now things are going to be different now uh you know don't worry about everything's amazing that passes fast things are good\nAnd you know and you see the way he's he's a he's talking you publicly um something people haven't really picked up on is you know talking about how our continent as being ripped off [noise] also I look at some of the dining seems frustrations a leading up to the moment where there was a deal\nI Know you mentioned a ... as kind of one of the items on the potential to do is we'll be regulatory streamlining anything I'd jump out as one of the issues\nYeah I'll give you an example so the for years now or the governments are um I've been working on this thing called the regulatory Cooperation Council\nAnd the idea is as follows I'll give you one specific example of how I understand it\nSo the different countries have different rules for Britain products to market which is normal every country has its own sovereign right the ... the regular stuff but sometimes those differences are so tiny and so insignificant but they cause big problems right so let's stick to lipstick\nCost something like eight hundred bucks to bring the market in the United states\nAnd Canada it costs I forgot what it was it was like Fifteen hundred two hundred thousand dollars I don't I don't remember the exact now I'll be honest but it's a lot of money and the reason they cost that much is because Canada a lipstick with that yes like some sun protection you as classified as a pharmaceutical oh\n... yeah exactly and so there's a whole bunch of different stuff like this and the system so the question is can we find a way\nTo remove duplication of record of regulations that don't really matter that are insignificant [noise] and then you get rid of those regulations and you just allow it to make it easier for companies to sell things a back and forth across for\nThis thing has been kind of you know that that whole thing starts in stops over the years hasn't really done much for the last couple of years 'cause there was a new government can't have you been a ... in the U.S [noise] so the idea is to have a conference this fall to try to jumpstart the process and get you know businesses rain gauge the government saying OK what can we do to change\nRegulations that are basically costing our economy money ...\n... or speaking with Alex Panetta from Politico he's the editor of political pro Canada has written a piece in titled behind the scenes with Trump and Trudeau\nHow they made a nice uh you represent a couple of times to dig in public speeches at each other across the border could that actually hamper things or is that something that's starting to\nTone down now how do you see it\nWell okay so here's the thing I think that President Trump deserves a lot of credit for some of the things she got an agreement you got things that frankly a rock Obama would have liked but at what cost right because what you've done is essentially you know publicly beat up on a smaller country next door\nA to gain these little things and in the meantime so the President Trump's approval rating of St Paul's that put it as low as ... percent and get her ... when you when you're ... percent yeah there's a lot you can do with another country and the other countries are gonna be happy to do with the right ... like you can't really ask for any favors\nAnd so you know take this compound it around the world so the steel tariffs you know using this this big stick to try to get changes it might work it really might work but on the other hand it might also in second eyes every single country in the world and make you make them less likely to help you or do things with you and going forward [noise]\nSo that's the problem in the car right so the you know the Obama's approach to the Trans Pacific partnership for instance was using the carrot try to gently bring countries along to the U. S. fold get some buying an agreement\nOn this is how we should do trade and this is how we should be work state owned enterprises that we do have to deal with data protections and to try to eventually get China to join that sort of international order\nTrump's approaches I had to put on ... and pound on you until you get in what I Want and the Chinese are going to do to make\nIt might work I don't know we'll talk in ten years but it also might really caused some problems [laughter]\nIt's great to Alexander Panetta at Politico it's Nineteen Minutes now after the hour\nMore civil Rahm is going through my\nBrooklyn in Brooklyn sheets name the winner of the best of online betting category by good housekeeping Brooklyn and is the fastest growing betting brand in the world over twenty thousand five star reviews Brooklyn was started by a husband and wife team who didn't think it should be so difficult and expensive\nTo get quality sheets at home their mission\nBrings five star hotel quality sheets do everyday life their luxuries sheets without the luxury markup Brooklyn in sheets don't just to feel great\nBut they also look great to Kelly nice to have them on our bed\nOne thing immediately noticeable help who they are in the hot weather Brooklyn and sheets are the best most comfortable sheets and right now Brooklyn in dot com is giving an exclusive opera just for our listeners get twenty dollars off and free shipping when you use the promo code deal at Brooklyn in dot com Brooklyn in his so sure\nIt's not often that a high school bands halftime performance gets this much attention but it was for all the wrong reason because\nIt was that two thousand two movies starring Denzel Washington and that was the inspiration for friday night performance by the forest hill high school band out of Jackson during its game at Brookhaven depicting a hostage situation which police officers were held at gunpoint\nSkin winter with Mississippi association of chiefs of police says that would have been inappropriate on any school campus but\nDo it at Brookhaven, Mississippi where the career is still reeling from two of their officers just being buried here last week it ...\nThe new superintendent of the Jackson public schools Dr Eric Green as apologized calling it incredibly insensitive coming on the heels of those police officer deaths and there's a word that the band director has been placed on administrative leave\nThe Brookhaven school district is calling the bans performance during those toy guns unfortunate amongst point man is facing a capital murder charge and the death of a woman during an argument over a car\nA famous black surrendered over the weekend in print is and the victims Cadillac escalate was recovered Betty bonds was found dead in our driveway last week\nThe shooters boy black hit her with that issue the some of the inmates at the stone county jail are recovering from carbon monoxide poisoning two of them needed hospital treatment and others have been temporarily relocated to another corrections facility\nJail officials say workers on the way to determine the source of the gas and to make the necessary repairs and you're up to date on news talk on all four nine W.

and counties have chosen to instead kind of Columbus Day as indigenous peoples dang it seems just started in Berkeley in the early nineties when the the council voted to honor native people\nAfter an international plan to celebrate Columbus fell apart and a few years before that\nSouth Dakota decided to rename a Native American\nDay that's just a Rosenthal and this is Fox News [noise]\nActions

processor to get business done\nAs Democrats enter the final sprint in a campaign were healthcare is a dominant issue in a house takeover seems achievable they are split\nOn whether to compromise rather to promise coverage for every one\nWhich would view on already revved up liberal base or target centrist voters by campaigning on the more modest school of fixing the Obama era health law polling indicates that no issue is more important to voters than health care and Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you're seeing is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November that Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off\nFar more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us there's something more for the twenty twenty presidential elections and it\nKind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crash especially in conservative\nStates that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate is playing out right now\nBoy who supports this ah well I'm an ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really at the Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point uh garnered I'm sixteen oh actually Fifteen caused by church because Al Franken drunk or on there and um there's now Medicare for all ... in the\nHouse I you're seeing a lot of um sort of the more younger newer faces who are challenging incumbent ... and also in in a lot more of the liberal states uh you're seeing that you know I'm a real talking point in Minnesota I'm with dean fell out\nAnd then on the Democratic side as well who is saying well we'll we'll we need to go easy here\nThe um [noise] uh individuals like men for example who ran who didn't really come out in support of Medicare fall um UC ...\nPeople like I'm In West Virginia who are a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\n... speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or beef was killed some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan it still play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support is strikingly high around Seventy percent but yeah the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interests that brings Sanders plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think I'm Single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrats there is a\nWidening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare's want the options even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that what was going to hit the road as this goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace the AC a that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know that they would go so far as to say it's a good at running program that I think they they are building on the popularity of Medicare itself which has high\nApproval rating summits beneficiaries and ... has a positive connotation and the public and I also think they that they see this as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone I'm as well as a way to ah\nAh lord us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being mentally disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against that I presume because there'd be less money for them\n[noise] yeah there is that the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care\nAnd um private payer such as insurance companies so they're concerned obviously about lower reimbursement but also they're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul the complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to be what were the last my coming into hospitals which tend will cause massive job losses in the industry", "year": "2018",
