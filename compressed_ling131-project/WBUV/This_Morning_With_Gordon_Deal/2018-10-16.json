campaign you know in the first couple of months to first Eighteen months really of\nA President Trump we are very different Sen Cruz summer we saw what you came to the Senate in ... he was working collaboratively with his colleagues he was working collaboratively White House he was working very hard to kind of play the inside game and get things done and so what we're seeing now is in the last six weeks there was some concern that Senator Cruz a faith in a little bit of trouble from\nIraq you know the massive Democrat keeper socket Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know\nOne thing that Senator Cruz says not\nRelied on an ass but that he was able to rely on and get help with\nWas the establishment kind of coming in and helping them out you know the vice president made the money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down to campaign for him or so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the the quintessential outsider candidate got to get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rates and make it to you know give him an edge on that in fact the\n... and how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting what I think you're calling from Ted Cruz's supporters his hardcore supporters that they would argue that you know through the conservatives are banned but he always was\nA he still has been abandoned his values one of one of the part that I talked to from ... comments actually\nYou know Ted Cruz is changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you he collapsed his support uh and that's not really what's happening is that he's just rely not helping the more collaborative of a bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters because of that I got it\nWhat are the are as you said the pieces campaign wobble earlier this year or why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I I think the thing about the federal workers he taught us money and he basically out of the ...\nUm you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that you know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sparked sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd he was on TV protect her the without sending cruise on TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be out fending an out raising at a Republican in Texas especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so I just started a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact\nAnd I think the campaign and not looking from Texas kicked into high gear towards the end of summer and going into the fall kind of realized that they ate the challenge and and you know they they step it up and call in shows that that Ted Cruz if we didn't pretty clear he's not running away with it but he's got a healthy or he said lead\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to kick it and again they were having a child from better over thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter wow that is just an absolute record\nFor St James Oregon Senate campaign reporter for political views wrote a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz stand it down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the high profile Republican tide turkey on it for a pack and remember famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to defend it you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really sort of an outside\nPressure force on the public and in fact the capital to force their hand and he did successfully forced their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and folks in the capital and to the the new time around in twenty Seventeen he was a meeting with Republican senator Gordon very closely with his colleague he wasn't there\nAnd bombed up that he tried to get a and you know they were unsuccessful but they were unsuccessful you know not because of the Senator Cruz in Bob's a bomb the way that he had previously and\nYou were quoted a Republican consultant in your story who said something to the effect of that a federal federal Rourke had become like Ted Cruz of this election almost like he was taking a page from cruises playbook [noise]\nIn a sense it's it's funny you know you get some pushback from Republicans and you've heard of that are working outside or because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of the house I'm honored and but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the average met again politics as usual get the way things are usually done in Washington\nAnd so he gave kind of trying to go on to the sort\nOf anti Taliban anti politics as usual maple trees and

this morning with sword in the\nNext\nWe're spending time with is the country's largest retailer\nAt one point Sears has filed for bankruptcy around since Eighteen eighty six it's been around right don't end by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores\nAnd then all the merchandise is able to get a dumped on the market right in the middle of a holiday season they have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with Toys R us just got off the presses the whole retail market\nStill which Sears the lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nThe way through high yeah they took on a huge amount of that they had five point six billion dollars and that are on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment that couldn't make which is what kind of spurred a the a chapter eleven filing\nUm they had too many assets as far as all these stores all over the place that would not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost to Amazon but they lost of other places as well the Home Depot\nAnd various other people took their their market share has been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share and two thousand seven down to panic is now yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just to keep up with a ...\nWhat what could have saved them stay stay I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively or keeping up the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions a competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise] ah but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployers all the high cost space it it really would have been hard for them to survive in this very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what ah the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now do they sort of live in fear\nI think so I mean the stories of not popular anyway so that that an accurate but an identity crisis\nThose places will be we developed\nA maybe other stores maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's going to be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization\nBut if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them all about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing it very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk up I Know exactly where the snow cashiers whatsoever so\nUh and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing it in a much more strategic way with much more limited inventory and select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a chore into many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to the when credible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all things with the IRS offers yes I think people will go up there and\nClean the place out with them which is going to take cells away from other traditional retailers who probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from other figure stores will\nWe still know the Sears brand than a year five years from now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been solved so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over time\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\n\nIs more of a program
