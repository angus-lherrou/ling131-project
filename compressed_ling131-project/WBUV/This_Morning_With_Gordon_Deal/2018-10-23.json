wave\nFor the mid term elections is not going to be as powerful as once believed that said history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections with a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nWell so for Democrats to win a control the Senate and that the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep her seat and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nWhere she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and\nIf she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and mess that one out in the balance ... usually important for the Democrats second one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Democrat other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights [laughter] very very uh ... a heavily funded from both sides\nAnd the wild card there all of a sudden is again Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort has been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance [laughter] can't third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring repairs on his kind of become the ultimate purple state could go either way in any election [noise] uh and you have to\nYou have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total one of those probably gonna have ears on him so that seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how\nThis adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm either going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about a ... who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in the mid term election compared to their performance in a presidential election so\nUh you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but you know enthusiasm

the [noise]\n\nWas there with a\nBook with a Tuesday in the house one of the most significant powers that comes with the majority is the ability of committee chairman to issue subpoenas House Judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte and oversight committee chairman Trey Gowdy are moving as fast\nAs they can knowing the Democrats stand a good chance of taking the house in the mid term elections what happens if Adam Schiff becomes chairman of house intelligence Elijah Cummings takes oversight and Gerald Nadler Helms the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI and the uh Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election\nThese are investigations that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of four chance of losing this should be ah the house\nMajority this year and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation\nIs it's up to the chairman of the house committee to issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own um say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee meets the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue subpoenas so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWhile still the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee I'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like\nWith the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house said they'll probe shifts they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of Devin Nunes has you'll have it being run by Adam shifts and he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and uh you'll have over in the house oversight committee electric Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd that Gerald Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from\nThe house side what Republicans hold the house then what happens [noise]\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em ... witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of\n'em raced to the finish interviews that'll put them in a position to really step up their investigations

just west of New York city\nAnd this was interested to see how hard the staff work to keep the students come and get them out of the building um you know school shootings\nYou know they're obviously way too many of them but they're still rare I mean it is unlikely that the school will be\nTargeted but it's a state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome or their behavioral challenges some of them are\nDisorders or medical issues and um they they work hard to
