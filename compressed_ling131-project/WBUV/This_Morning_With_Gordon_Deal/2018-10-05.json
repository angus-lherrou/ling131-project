ahead of the midterm elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors so Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races that were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believed the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and we believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand\nWhat really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being\nBeen a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their desire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republicans in a lot of cases seemed to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nMm All right so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nA big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA we're now in the upper single digits or in terms of his lead and the polling averages a you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely to vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen I think we've seen also\nA this has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill a declared fairly early that she was going to vote against capital she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch a Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that did have a three\nBut in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead and this could be a a race for its influence to but by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections where Democrats are already pretty energized because they dislike President Trump\nThey dislike Republicans are doing a Washington seems to them like another power grab a bite narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump to the first place was we wanted conservative judges cared about who is controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal to have Anthony Kennedy seat go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term elections so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nJim Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner\nForce of the program is Rossi my recruiter was not smart\nAnd making the lottery the

Newman his piece is called Trump's base strategy on trade rebranding how much of this bill might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\n[laughter] well I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution or where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he picks fights with Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum in the United states that includes Japan\nAnd of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico so as we progress through these development it does seem that that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts who say look\nI'm we really don't have that much that trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else they basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies um when you need their help\nTo put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA\nThis new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay hum it it it it was first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries and that is not a given um if it turns out the Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible\nWe can be stuck with the NAFTA for the indefinite future\nIt's Rick Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman\nReminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on Twitter with the username at this morning show you can follow me directly on Twitter as well with a user name at Gordon Deal twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas burst news\n[noise]\nCapital one is building a better bank one that feels an ax nothing like a typical bank it's why they're reimagining banking and building something completely different\nYou made the dean's list ...

Jones ... what have you found\nI mean I think that there are a lot of questions swirling as that Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is being waged and one of them is things that you did or allegedly did when you were very young in high school or maybe even college can kind of hot you when you're looking for work or\nOut in the professional community decades later and basically the answer is yes you know we're in this new moment where social media is ubiquitous and people can Google you you make a bad show to take a picture you shouldn't have taken at a party that can come up\nYears later and that's something that people really need to reckon with and think about whether there are a parent with a teenager or you're a teenager you know preparing to kind of go into adulthood and trying to figure out how to navigate that world\nBoy I I have that conversation over and over with my teenage kids but I feel like we're still learning phase with this because I ... you know when they're recording abilities and spontaneous picture taking you know generally speaking or is this still a new thing\nYou know it isn't it it's it's something that's in some ways it's unfortunate in the sense that when you know when we were kids you could make mistakes I'm I'm not talking about criminal acts here but just things that were kind of stupid and\nUm you know you might have a friend that remembered it and killed it at a family reunion or the high school reunion years later but it wasn't going to come up when the workplace but it's just a very different world and employers are really do look at this stuff there was a\nSurvey that found that forty three percent of organizations for using social media to to the vet applicants and more than one in three had disqualified a candidate\nI'm In the previous here based on shuttling information that they had found online so it's a new world but this is what we're dealing with and we have to kind of face that\nWe're speaking with Sharif Jones national business correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled Brett Kavanaugh testifies useful mistakes can affect job prospects what's the phrase you used banned the box which some several states have adopted\nYet so banning of the box office when you've got a job application they've got this question have you ever been convicted of a crime and a you know that kind of stop stealing a track ... fat you've got a lot of employers who are saying okay that's it we're not going to even talk to you\nSo you've got states like California that are saying you know that's ridiculous you know give these people a chance\nUm that you can be rehabilitated people make mistakes and so now you can't ask\nThat question um until you're ready to offer the person a job and the thinking is by that time he's got a sense of what they have to offer you met them he's gotten to know them a little bit like them and so you might be um you know you might get them a little bit more leeway in looking at their path\nAnd their attorneys that you know often will write letters on behalf of of client saying you know this person said you know a good guy or a good woman give them a chance and so that's becoming a little bit more common even though people increasingly want to know more about you when they're interviewing you for a job\nYou know anybody saying that the reputation damage when falls is actually been able to be repaired\nI mean I think it depends I mean I've talked to people who you know actually hired people\nWho had something come up in their path that was not a good thing they gave him a chance and you know often they are the hardest workers because they know that they've got a couple of strikes against them and they really are safer for the opportunity was certainly seen high profile examples of this and that said Williams\nUm infamously I had to give up a crowd isn't is America years ago because of some pictures that we're not supposed to even be publishing that she had taken when she was a model of her nude\nHad been published by a magazine and now she's an award winning actress and singer and I'm sure that a whole generation is even know about\nWhat happened at that time and so you know certainly you can come back from it but we also have examples of folks that are still struggling with Italy Angela ball who got caught shoplifting in China and he was able to get back to the u._s. but he's blamed not getting picked by the NBA\nI mean the latest draft on that incident and so it's kind of hit or miss and so you've got to really think
