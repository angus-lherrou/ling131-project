{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "They were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA some you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice and I was not nice do Mother Nature\nOf on yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant you know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a log in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on it\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots\nHoward by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy\nThis guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I play in every once in a while you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you\nKnow the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah and\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the ... the ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own\nConquers yes

good things for ourselves visionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what are you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start can dream and drain in a big way we know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch\nReally far so that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and when we wonder and we think it I go by that ticket given that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance in a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however I see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nShorter and so you think about getting out and not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back

thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know I\nSure I mean if we dream did that then we don't follow it up with any then I mean that creates us to go into things like
