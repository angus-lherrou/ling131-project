defined folks who could walk that tight rope of being proof on national security issues while also being bona fide of their progress is a good grasp of background\nI mean a lot of times the the ... the Republicans are the ones who are sort of aligned themselves with the party of as a party a flag and country of patriotism\nBut there's a both both an up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are sort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets in and then there's a few dozen\nVeterans running on me or on the Democratic side or the vets are seemingly\nWilling to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party have said that veterans have been a have been approaching a party said we're we're interested in running a and shape time\nThe Democratic party has a has a number of different things that's putting in place to to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat to be in the house representatives who have\nWorked together fundraising apparatus taking a leadership role in the party and I have had really come out to

Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates um there was one analyst or expert or observer and your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point there\nRight well the point there is that ah with with any military veteran running sometimes the the iconography of uh of learning as a patriot the background and experience of being in the military\nOr can can can I should warn people into being one trick pony so that the military service can become the ... the summer there are several parts and right now that that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they aren't veteran himself in the running against entrance to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the person service but you know there's there's other applications that are more important and in this very partisan environment a rise election cycle [noise] um there
