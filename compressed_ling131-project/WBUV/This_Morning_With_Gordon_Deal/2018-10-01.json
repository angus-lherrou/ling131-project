like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this is a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting

like they were too perfect not a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere so\nThey just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped in chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road

dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection\nThese humanoid that I saw\nIn the woods the more I think about it there's I'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and in

[noise] well it really far away and the you know maybe I'm just imagining that\nSo I kept hanging on look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say three miles in maybe ten minutes

cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times can what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aid security there were really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't too doesn't sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way what's what's what's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the ... prior to two dozen fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um\nThe server it's like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability that are none south of ... that we know about that I'm also have a patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis defeat when the um the customer has a patch to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty ... and then they've done that to more states more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system not getting at the core ... they're supposedly not connected to the ... not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there and it's often not touching I'm order the election management systems\nThese are the system to sit in a county headquarters a there used to program the voting machines and they're also used to calculate the votes so these are actually the most critical instance not the Internet they think this them\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our election system to be hacked 'cause at for let's going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail on and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nUm yes so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered um have mandated California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines\nI'm happy to have the need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine for um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are not looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cybersecurity

the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh assistance and many states I'm

from before more from ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nWe've got to cry basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk whether we're bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know boogie Boston crises [laughter] but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much wary or of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and they're still reach for that one is that well I'm pretty country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages to show that limited who couldn't buy a house\nAnd also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing ambulances methods combined it tends to be a little bit more muted [laughter] you don't have as many people going to start their own business and partly because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity\nOh to start your new business those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [laughter]\nSure you have your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know ... it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley what people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new businesses being formed does actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially\nA people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with Greg ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean\nOnce we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or that aren't related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat as I say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate and fell into that so in some sense pessimism is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nIn that the system for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like you've got to bust in a recession [noise] now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances of about which\nThe risk of start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis but you know risque but kinda like goes away can sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill\nEncountered a barrier tried to find a way around it and and when you happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense skill at risk out there it's just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\nWhich Greg

former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is hinting\nAnother explanation she recently gave is the reason for her last Donald Trump and twenty sixteen more from Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard who says her comments bring up the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private boots and a place like a school Eric set this up\nIt's one of those things where to the extent it happens at all it's\nA threat to you know basic democracy and we have a system\nThat works where you can't have that kind of that kind of anecdote happen at all everybody's got perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth people don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail\nIt convenience factor to me does not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their honest vote and\nMrs Clinton I I think made it sound like women are weak and powerless at times when it was with this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want\nAnd uh it to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's worth protecting against by going to the ballot box um and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives um I have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular\nI'm making it more convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote and they can go and make sure everybody gets\nTheir mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many bands you can send out to get people to the voting booth [noise] um but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies\nVote for him to turn out the vote a ... is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\n... turning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm part this is because a lot of what the B I'm democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient should show the more convenient you can make it more likely you are to get voters to turn out who are otherwise it deterred by inconvenient\n... just a a I don't I don't think I've heard pushback on this with regards to these comments from Mrs Clinton is is this is a fairly new excuse or is this one that she's been using\nYou know to the point was Hillary has been making excuses for why she laws\nAnd I kind of connected the dots with the vote by mail because it is she was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible\nUm but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that if there are any women who are being pressured to vote one way or another the only way they could possibly be actually pressured\nIs if they don't have the secrecy of the ballot box available to them and combine that with the growth of vote by mail and I think that there's a story
